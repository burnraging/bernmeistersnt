HEADING2                             *Translation Method*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *This is a translation, not a paraphrase. I used the UBS <i|Greek New Testament|i> 3<s|rd|s> Edition as the source, supplemented with phone apps and we*
                                     *bsites. I didn’t use copyrighted translations as a basis, and only referred to one or two now or then for confirmation, a second opinion, for comparis*
                                     *on after the fact, or to simply quote. I never copied any copyrighted translations. Since the KJV and ASV are public domain, I referred to them when I*
                                     * was at my wit’s end. I relied on several commentaries and lexicons plus the occasional grammar book. Of course, I had to research specific areas.*
HEADING2                             *The Usual Markups*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Verse numbers are all superscripted, along with footnote references. Any of the traditional verse numbers missing from the UBS text were footnoted. As*
                                     * everyone knows, no punctuation or other special formatting was put in the original manuscripts; these all originate in the translation.*
HEADING2                             *Italics*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Words in italics are interpolations. Interpolations consist of words, phrases, or even entire sentences which are added which are not derived from a l*
                                     *iteral translation of the Greek text. What’s deemed an interpolation is not always cut and dry. I did not consider nuances insinuated by a verb tense *
                                     *or some other grammatical construct or by a shade of meaning of a word used in a particular context to be interpolations.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Some of the text was radically modified and although the rendered version has interpolations, it was too messy to italicize, especially the places mar*
                                     *ked <i|liberties taken|i>. These were marked and handled in footnotes.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *You cannot make sense of the NT without interpolations, as the writers purposely omitted words for the sake of brevity. Or they were just plain sloppy*
                                     *. Sometimes, though, the writers assumed that the readers had certain a background understanding, one which the modern reader doesn’t have. Some of th*
                                     *e interpolations I added, especially the longer ones, are obvious additions. Because the aim of this translation is to produce something which is unde*
                                     *rstandable by the average person, such additions are crucial at times.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Of course, all interpolations are subjective, and as such are a source of disagreement. The reason why they’re set off in italics is to alert the read*
                                     *er that they are additions and should be received as such. Since I plan to publish both an abridged and a unabridged version, the unabridged will have*
                                     * the interpolations left in but their italics removed (and I never used italics for anything other than an interpolation).*
HEADING2                             *Footnotes*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Footnotes are noted with both capital and small letters formatted in superset and enclosed in brackets. The small-letter footnotes are, for the most p*
                                     *art, comments on the translation or are short general comments. Capital-letter footnotes are long small-letter comments, are explanations about what s*
                                     *ome difficult verses and passages mean, or are just random comments about the passage.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *The footnotes supplement the translation where the translation fails to do justice to the text, or where there’s extra detail which the curious reader*
                                     * may glean: nuances or other shades of meaning that weren’t thoroughly captured in the translation, as it would be too wordy. In the course of this wo*

FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(c) The writing is simply not Mark’s style*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *Let us look at these claims in detail.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *First, Mark mentions that Mary Magdalene had had seven demons cast out of her. Any forger would know that Mary Magdalene was brought up in v.1 and wou*
                                     *ld’ve written accordingly. But the extra statement of her having demons cast out is not an introduction but a reminder of the grace she had received, *
                                     *resulting in a tender heart which caused her to be the first to believe when the others wouldn’t. To emphasize this, Mark, when he said <i|had cast ou*
                                     *t|i>, chose to use the Gk. perfect tense over the aorist for emphasis. In support of this, v.10 begins with the words <i|that lady|i>, which invites t*
                                     *he reader to detach himself and ponder her history. The other women weren’t address in that fashion.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *Second, there are a few words which Mark uses in this passage that don’t appear elsewhere in his book (never mind the fact that every chapter of Mark *
                                     *has unique words used in its chapter which Mark uses nowhere else). Let us look at these words:*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(i) <i|Accompany|i> (v.17). This is a more specific word that pre-pends the word <i|with |i>to <i|follow. |i>Certainly Mark knew the meaning of this w*
                                     *ord.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(ii) <i|Serpent|i> (v.18). A common word.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(iii) <i|Hurt|i> (v.18). Ranks 2808<s|th|s> out of 5394, where 1 is most common and 5394 is least. This word is uncommon.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(iv) <i|Poison|i> (v.18). Derived from a very common root.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(v) The phrase <i|so then|i> (v. 19). Two extremely common words used as a phrase. Mark certainly knew the meaning of the phrase, but didn’t use it an*
                                     *ywhere else.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(vi) <i|Working alongside|i> (v.20). This is the verb form of the commonly-used noun <i|fellow-worker.|i>*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *(vii) <i|Confirm|i> (v.20). Appears as 2803<s|rd|s> out of 5394. This word is uncommon and is not derived from a commonly used root.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *We can strike serpent, hurt, and poison from the list, since there are no alternatives for these words; Mark would’ve asked the scribe who was doing t*
                                     *he actual writing to supply these words had he not known them and when he had need of them. This leaves four words, three of which are common, and Mar*
                                     *k certainly knew, but he hadn’t used before. The list of uncommon words is whittled down to the single word <i|confirm.|i>*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *As far as the style is concerned—and this is quite open-ended—true, Mark shifts his preference in verb tenses around, but this passage has little stor*
                                     *y-telling narrative. Another thing to note are the figures of speech used in vv.15,16. Would a forgerer risk using a figure or speech? Would a forgere*
                                     *r dwell on the disciples not believing when they should have (vv.13,14). While all these things with style are debatable, they are not definitive in d*

                                     *4, where Luke compares Jesus sweat to drops of blood. But throughout the book, he is mindful of detail and correctness, as what he writes must reflect*
                                     * what the eyewitnesses told him in face-to-face interviews. In the example of the Pharisee and the tax collector praying at the temple (Luke 18:11,13)*
                                     *, Luke says that both stood, but uses a different form of the same verb <i|to stand, |i>subtlety conveying the difference in their standing postures. *
                                     *Moreover in 18:13, Luke’s prose garnishes the story beautifully (literal rendering): “But the tax collector standing at a distance was not wanting nei*
                                     *ther to lift up the eyes to heaven.” Luke is sparing in his use of special forms and expressions, but by being sparing when he does use special forms,*
                                     * his usage is more effective. For example, in Luke 17:37, Luke uses the present tense to mean the past tense—he does not do that often, like in the ot*

                                     *sus was watching in real time; each time they cast out a demon, he saw a lightning strike.*
FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *The elements to the correct interpretation of this passage, first, is that the word translated <i|was watching |i>is in the Gk. imperfect tense. In th*
                                     *is case, it insinuates multiple, repeated action, not a single action; plus it insinuates Jesus watching something unfold in real-time (in other words*
                                     *, watching concurrently as the disciples were doing it). Second, the Gk. word for <i|heaven |i>(<i|ouranos|i>/οὐρανός/Strong’s 3772) can mean either t*
                                     *he sky (Acts 1:1), heaven itself (Luke 10:14), the spiritual world around us (1 Cor. 12:2; Eph. 6:12), or a place of spiritual dominion. In the case o*
                                     *f Luke 10:18, <i|ouranos |i>means the third: a place of spiritual dominion. Third, the word <i|Satan |i>is used as a synecdoche/metonymy for the word *
                                     *<i|demon|i> (also in Matt. 12:26; Luke 13:16). Fourth, the word <i|fall |i>refers to somebody or something losing its authority or dominion, usually b*

FOOTNOTES_NORMAL                     *The correct interpretation of Jesus seeing multiple demons get cast down in real-time is relevant to the enclosing context. In other words, Jesus sent*
                                     * the disciples out, and in v. 17 they come back rejoicing, telling what had happened. Jesus regurgitating something which happened thousands of years *
                                     *before would be irrelevant and incongruous to the remark his disciples just made.*

VERSES_NARRATIVE                     *He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed myself off, and now I can see.” *

                                     *ting |i>refers to pouring oil over someone (ex: John 11:2). Throughout the Bible, anointing a person marks that person with extraordinary abilities, a*

                                     *nting. The 1 John 2 anointing is the ability to understand how exactly one should conduct himself in a godly manner on a day-to-day basis. The 1 John *
                                     *2 anointing gives a person the ability to discern for himself what the correct thing is for him to do in life. Incidentally, this passage here refutes*
                                     * the notion that any church leader (especially a cult leader) should be deciding what an individual church member should do in their circumstances of *
