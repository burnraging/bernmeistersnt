NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *This is a translation, not a paraphrase. I used the UBS Greek New Testament 3<s|rd|s> Edition as the source, supplemented with phone apps and websites*
                                     *. I didn’t use copyrighted translations as a basis, and only referred to one or two now or then for confirmation, a second opinion, for comparison aft*

                                     *t my wit’s end. I relied on several commentaries and lexicons plus the occasional grammar book. Of course, I had to research specific areas.*
HEADING2                             *The Usual Markups*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Verse numbers are all superscripted, along with footnote references. Any of the traditional verse numbers missing from the UBS text were footnoted. As*
                                     * everyone knows, no punctuation or other special formatting was put in the original manuscripts; these all originate in the translation.*
HEADING2                             *Italics*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Words in italics are interpolations. Interpolations consist of words, phrases, or even entire sentences which are added which are not derived from a l*
                                     *iteral translation of the Greek text. What’s deemed an interpolation is not always cut and dry. I did not consider nuances insinuated by a verb tense *
                                     *or some other grammatical construct or by a shade of meaning of a word used in a particular context to be interpolations.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Some of the text was radically modified and although the rendered version has interpolations, it was too messy to italicize, especially the places mar*
                                     *ked liberties taken. These were marked and handled in footnotes.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *You cannot make sense of the NT without interpolations, as the writers purposely omitted words for the sake of brevity. Or they were just plain sloppy*
                                     *. Sometimes, though, the writers assumed that the readers had certain a background understanding, one which the modern reader doesn’t have. Some of th*
                                     *e interpolations I added, especially the longer ones, are obvious additions. Because the aim of this translation is to produce something which is unde*
                                     *rstandable by the average person, such additions are crucial at times.*
NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *Of course, all interpolations are subjective, and as such are a source of disagreement. The reason why they’re set off in italics is to alert the read*
                                     *er that they are additions and should be received as such. Since I plan to publish both an abridged and a unabridged version, the unabridged will have*
                                     * the interpolations left in but their italics removed (and I never used italics for anything other than an interpolation).*

NON_VERSE_CONTENT                    *The footnotes supplement the translation where the translation fails to do justice to the text, or where there’s extra detail which the curious reader*

VERSES_NARRATIVE                     *<s|24|s>They then called for the man, the one who was blind, a second time and said to him, “Come clean on this and tell us the truth. We know that th*
