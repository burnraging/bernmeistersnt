&MATT 1
1|A Genealogical Record[A] of Jesus Christ, Descendent of 
David and of Abraham:

2|Abraham had Isaac,
Isaac had Jacob,
Jacob had Judah and his brothers,

3|Judah had Fares and Zara from Tamar[B], 
Fares had Hesrom,
Hesrom had Aram,

4|Aram had Aminadab
Aminadab had Naasson,
Naason had Salmon,

5|Salmon & Rahab had Boaz,
Boaz & Ruth had Obed,
Obed had Jesse,

6|Jesse had King David,
David got with Urriah’s wife and had Solomon,

7|Solomon had Rehoboam,
Rehoboam had Abia,
Abia had Asaf,

8|Asaf had Jehosaphat,
Jehosaphat had Jeoram,
Jeoram had Ozias,

9|Ozias had Jotham,
Jotham had Ahab,
Ahab had Hezekiah,

10|Hezekiah had Manassah,
Manassah had Amos,
Amos had Josiah,

11|Josiah had Jehonias and his brothers while in captivity in Babylon,

12|After the Babylonian captivity, Jehonias had Salathial,
Salathial had Zerubabel,

13|Zerubabel had Abioud,
Abiod had Eliakim,
Eliakim had Azor,

14|Azor had Zadok,
Zadok had Achim,
Achim had Eliud,

15|Eliud had Eleazar,
Eleazar had Matthan,
Matthan had Jacob,

16|Jacob had Joseph, Mary’s husband,
…and from her was born Jesus, who’s called “the Christ.”

          
17|In total, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David; there 
were fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian captivity; there were fourteen 
generations from the Babylonian captivity to Jesus.

18|The Way Jesus’s Birth Was
      After Mary was engaged but before she was officially married[C] to Joseph—and 
before she was intimate[D] with him—she found that she was pregnant, and that it was 
from the Holy Spirit. 
19|Her husband Joseph, being someone who always did the 
right thing and not wanting to disgrace Mary, decided to himself that he’d quietly break 
up with her. 
20|After he talked himself into doing this—of all things—an angel 
sent from the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
      “Joseph, you marvelous godsend[a], don’t be afraid to keep Mary as your wife; 
what she’s conceived in fact came from the Holy Spirit. 
21|She’ll give birth to a 
son, and you’re going to name him ‘Jesus’[b], since he will indeed deliver the people 
from their sins.” 
22|All of this has happened in order to fulfill the prophecy[c] 
which came through the Prophet Isaiah, which says,


23|Check this out! Our virgin here will get pregnant and give birth to a son,
And they’ll call him Emmanuel (which translated means “God with us”)


24|Joseph woke up from the dream and did just as he was told to do by the angel 
sent from God and kept Mary as his wife 
*[a]you marvelous godsend…Lit: You descendent of David. Ref. note of Matt. 12:23.
*[b]Jesus…The name Jesus in Hebrew means deliverer or rescuer
*[c]prophecy…Lit: word by the Lord

*[A]A genealogical record…It begs the question, “Just why does the NT begin with a genealogy?” It’s 
because all OT characters of any significance have their genealogy enumerated, which is important as 
Matthew was written for a Jewish audience. It’s to show that Jesus fulfills the promises and prophecies 
repeated throughout the ages. It establishes Jesus’s pedigree, which while not important to us today 
was important in OT times. It shows the mercy of God and providence of God as Jesus descended from 
less-than-perfect humans.
*[B]Fares and Zara from Tamar…Some liberties taken with translating the names. Attempt made to render 
well-known names as they appear in most English Bibles, but no attempt was made to do all of them; 
some are as-is from the GT.
*[C]engaged but before she was officially married to…In Jewish culture, Mary’s engagement to Joseph was 
just a step shy of a real marriage, certainly stronger than what we consider to be an engagement. To 
break such an engagement constituted a divorce.
[D]before she was intimate…Lit: before their coming together; didn’t sleep with her (v.25)…Lit: didn’t 
know her. These are biblical euphemisms for sex. Of note is that the verb tense in v.18 coming together 
specifies a one-time event.

Matthew

25|and didn’t sleep[D] with her until after 
she’d given birth to the son, whom he named Jesus.


&MATT 2
1|Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the province of Judea, during the 
days of King Herod, out of nowhere these gurus called “magii”[A] who came from the 
East[B] and showed up in Jerusalem 
2|going about saying, “Where’s that child-king of 
the Jews? The fact is, we saw his star while over in the East and came to worship him.”
          
3|Hearing about this made King Herod queasy, along with everyone else in 
Jerusalem. 
4|So he gathered the chief priests and the designated teachers called 
scribes[C] and quizzed them to find out exactly where the Messiah[D] would be born. 

5|They told him, “In Bethlehem, Judea, since it’s been written about by the Prophet 
Micah:


6|”And for you, Bethlehem, Judea, by no means
Do you come in last place
In the Judean power rankings;
For out of you will come a ruler who’ll lead my people Israel”

          
7|Then Herod stealthily summoned the magii and ascertained from them the 
time of the star’s appearance, 
8|and sent them to Bethlehem telling them, “Go ask 
around and gather all the facts you can about this child. Then after you find him, come 
tell me so that I can come and worship him too.” 
9|Having heard this from the king, 
they went out and—just like that—the same star which they saw back east took the lead 
in front of them until it reached the place where the child was and then stood still up 
over that place. 
10|Seeing what the star had done, they got really excited[a]. 

11|They went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary and fell flat 
on their faces and worshipped him. Then they opened their chests and delivered gifts to 
him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
12|And having received a divine instruction 
given through a dream to not return to Herod but instead to take another way out, they 
left to go back to their homeland.
          
13|Now after they had departed, just like that an angel appeared in a dream 
to Joseph telling him, “Get up, grab the child and his mother, and run for your life to 
Egypt. Stay there until I tell you. Herod, you see, is going about seeking to eliminate the 
child.” 
14|So he got up, took the child and his mother, and left for Egypt under the 
cover of darkness. 
15|And he stayed there until Herod passed away, in order that 
the prophet Hosea’s prophecy[b] would be fulfilled, which says, “From out of Egypt I 
summoned my son.”
          
16|Now when Herod realized that he’d been tricked by the magii, he got 
really angry and had all the children in Bethlehem and all the surrounding areas 
eliminated, from two and under, consistent with the time which he’d ascertained from 
the magii. 
17|It was then that the prophet Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled, which 
says,


18|A sound was heard in Ramah[E]—
Weeping and wailing—
Rachel[E] crying over her children
And she wasn’t wanting to be comforted,
Since they’re gone for good

          
19|After Herod died—just like that—an angel sent from the Lord appeared 
in a dream to Joseph while in Egypt 
20|saying,
      “Get up and take the child and his mother and go to Israel, now that those 
who’ve been craving to snuff out the child’s life are finally dead.”
          
21|So he got up and took the child and his mother and entered the country 
of Israel. 
22|But since he heard that Archelaos had replaced his father as king of 
Judea, he was afraid to go over there. Getting instructions through a dream, he 
detoured over to the Galilean area, 
*[a]Seeing what the star had done, they got really excited…Lit: Seeing the star, they rejoiced in a joy 
exceedingly. The repetition of joy here is a figure of speech. Also ref. Mark 5:42.
*[b]prophecy…Lit: Word of the Lord
*[c]prophecy…Lit: word

*[A]magii…The magii were spiritualists who were genuinely seeking after the One True God. They 
interpreted astrological signs as from God. They didn’t worship the stars above but nevertheless 
expected God to use them—which in both the OT and NT, God at times does use astrological signs to 
communicate with man.
*[B]The East…Literal rendering of the GT. Just as we might say that those folks out West do such-and-such, 
and things are done different down South, so the East in the Bible has connotations of its own (Gen. 2:8, 
3:24, 4:16 for some) as being a mystical, spiritual place.
*[C]Chief priests and the designated teachers called Scribes…these are the elites of the religious class. The 
chief priest held the power while the scribes had the utmost knowledge and expertise, called on to 
settle disputes.
*[D]the Messiah…Lit: Christ. The Jews have always believed that the Scripture speaks of a messianic 
person, whom is named the Christ, which is equivalent to the Messiah.
[E]Ramah…Rachel…The place Ramah and the name Rachel are metonymies , where Rachel, assumed to 
be a common woman’s name, personifies the suffering of the average woman, and where Ramah is 
remotely associated with the area. To put in terms that the contemporary generation understands, the 
name Rachel is a meme like the name Karen is a meme for the Gen-Z’ers. To be clear, Rachel is not a 
Karen—i.e. both are memes but characterize entirely different types of women. The place Ramah is a 
metonymy similar to the metonymy Timbuktu. Ramah refers to your typical town in the area, whereas 
Timbuktu refers to some unknown faraway place. Both were and are real places but little was and is 
known about them, making them suitable to be used as metonymies. But one example of a 
meme/metonymy name and place in English, one in which we refer to ordinary, arbitrary people who 
live in an abstract and far-way place is “Every Tom, Dick, and Harry in Timbuktu…”

Matthew

Matthew
23|and when he got there, he settled in a city 
called Nazareth, in order that what the prophets had prophesied would be fulfilled, that 
he would be considered to be a Nazarene.


&MATT 3
1|Now back in those days, John the Baptist appeared on the scene in the 
Judean countryside[a] 
2|saying, “Straighten up and change your ways[b], since God’s 
involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven) just got here! 
3|You see, what’s 
taking place here is the prophecy from Isaiah which says,

The sound of shouting in the countryside:
“Block off the road the Lord will take!
Barricade the streets he’ll be on![c]”

          
4|John dressed himself in a camel-hair outfit wrapped in a leather belt, and his 
diet consisted of grasshoppers[d] and wild honey.[A] 
5|At that time everybody[B] in 
Jerusalem and Judea and everybody from around the Jordan kept coming out to see 
him. 
6|And they were one after another being baptized in the Jordan River by him 
while pouring their hearts out in confessing their sins out loud.
          
7|Seeing that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were showing up at his 
baptism, he said to them, “You nest[C] of vipers, who convinced you to run for your 
lives because of the coming wrath? 
8|Have the change in lifestyle[e] which goes hand-
in-hand with the commitment to a change in ways[f]. 
9|And while discussing this 
among yourselves, don’t say, ‘We’re descendants of Abraham.’[D] Oh yes—I tell you, 
God is able to turn these stones[E] here into descendants[g] of Abraham. 
10|The axe 
is lying next to the tree trunk[F] and is ready to be used: Every tree which isn’t yielding 
good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into a fire. 
11|Me—I baptize in water 
towards the goal of repentance, but the one who’ll come after me is greater[h] than me; 
I’m not worthy enough to carry him around by the soles of his shoes.[G] But him—he’ll 
baptize in a fiery manifestation of the Holy Spirit[H]—which words fall short to describe; 

12|with the winnowing fork in his hand, he’ll clear everything off his threshing 
floor too. He’ll store his wheat in the silo but will burn up the chaff with a fire that will 
never be put out.”
          
13|Then Jesus appeared on the scene in the Jordan region, coming from 
Galilee, to get with John, to be baptized by him. 
14|But John brushed him off 
saying, “It’s me who needs to be baptized by you, but you’re approaching me instead?” 

15|Jesus formulated a reply and said, “Let’s go through with it.[i] This way, no 
doubt, it’ll be noted by us all that all the requirements were fulfilled.” He then 
permitted it. 
16|While he was being baptized, he came straight up out of the water, 
and—of all things—the sky opened up, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like 
a dove upon him. 
*[a]countryside…Lit: wilderness
*[b]Straighten up and change your ways…Lit: repent
*[c]Block off the roads he’ll take! Barricade the streets he’ll be on!…Lit: Prepare the Lord’s road! Straighten 
his paths! Some liberties taken.
*[d]grasshoppers…Lit: locusts
*[e]have the change in lifestyle…Lit: produce the fruit
*[f]goes hand in hand with the commitment to a change in ways…Lit: is worthy of repentance
*[g]descendants…Lit: sons
*[h]greater…Lit: mightier
*[i]Let’s go through with it…Lit: let now. This is echoed at the end of v.15, where it lit. says, he then let 
him.

*[A]John dressed himself in a camel-hair outfit wrapped in a leather belt, and his diet consisted of 
grasshoppers and wild honey…His clothing was uncomfortable, ungainly, and unattractive; his food did 
not taste good and was inconvenient to procure.
*[B]everybody…The word everybody here is a figure of speech (a type of Synecdoche), and does not 
actually mean every single person. It’s like if we were to say, “Everybody was at the Christmas party last 
week.”
*[C]nest…Lit: brood
*[D]We’re descendants of Abraham…Lit: We have Abraham as a father, implying that God approves of 
their lives because of their pedigree
*[E]These stones…Here and in other places, the NT hints that stones are symbolic of the masses of 
mankind
*[F]The axe is laid next to the tree trunk…Also: Someone’s about to drop the hammer. Note the word laid 
means put into position, same as in Phil. 1:16.
*[G]I’m not worthy enough to carry him around by the soles of his shoes…Lit: not worthy enough to bear 
the sole of his shoe. In the Bible, putting somebody “under your feet” is to put him in subjection to you. 
Bearing someone by the sole of his shoe is an act of servitude and humility akin to a servant would wash 
his master’s feet.
[H]a fiery manifestation of the Holy Spirit…Lit: in the Holy Spirit and fire. This is a figure of speech called a 
hendiadys. There is no actual baptism in fire; it means that Holy Spirit will manifest himself in a fiery 
way. This figure of speech also appears in John 4:23,24, in spirit and in truth. In both cases, the 
hendiadys is indicates something which can hardly be put in words but has to be experienced; hence the 
additional words which words fall short to describe. It is also used in Mk. 11:24; John 10:1. Most/all the 
hendiadyses which occur in the Gospels share something in common: they all describe a spiritual 
experience or a spiritual being, and being spiritual in nature transcend human comprehension, thus the 
use of the hendiadys.

Matthew

Matthew
17|And—of all things—a voice spoke from the sky saying, “This 
one here is my Beloved Son, and I’m quite pleased with him.”


&MATT 4
1|Then Jesus was guided by the Spirit into the countryside[a] to be tempted[A] by 
the devil. 
2|After fasting for forty days and nights, he finally became hungry, 
3|and 
the Tempter came by and said,
      “If your position is indeed Son of God, speak so that these stones become bread.”
       
4|But he answered him, “It’s written,

Man will not live by bread only,
But by every word coming out of the mouth of God”

          
5|So the devil then took him to the holy city, and placed him on the 
battlements on the temple roof[B]. 
6|He turned and, in continuation, said,
      “If you’re indeed God’s son, jump off. I mean, it’s written,

Where you are concerned,
He’ll issue orders for His angels to follow.
They’ll even lift you up by putting you on their hands,
Lest your foot impact a stone.”

          
7|Jesus declared to him, “But again it’s written, ‘You shall not vet the Lord 
your God, applying a test to determine whether He passes or fails.’”
          
8|So again the devil took him to a really high mountain and shows him all the 
kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
9|And he said, “All of these I’ll give to you, if 
you would fall and worship me.” 
10|Then Jesus, finishing the conversation, said, 
“Depart, Satan! In regard to this, it’s written,

You will worship the Lord God
And offer spiritual service to Him alone”

          
11|Then the devil left him, and—then and there—some angels came and 
attended to him.
          
12|Once he heard that John had been taken into custody, he withdrew to 
Galilee. 
13|After leaving Nazareth for good, he took up residence in Capernaum-
on-the-Sea in the region of Zebulon and Naphtali, 
14|so that Isaiah’s prophecy[b] 
might be fulfilled, which says,


15|In the land of Zebulon and in the land of Naphtali
On the road leading to the sea, on the other side of the Jordan
In the region of Galilee—

16|The folk sitting in darkness saw a great light,
And for the ones sitting in a region 
Where they were under the shadow of death[C]
A light shined on them


17|Starting then, Jesus began to go about and proclaim openly,

Straighten up and change your ways[c],
Since God’s involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven)
Just got here!

          
18|While sauntering down the Sea of Galilee coastline, he saw two brothers, 
Simon, whom they call Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting fishing nets into the sea, 
since they were fishermen. 
19|He said to them, “Be my disciples,[D] and I’ll make 
you fishermen who fish for men.” 
20|Right away they quit being fishermen[E] and 
became his disciples[d].
          
21|Continuing on from there, he saw another pair[e] of brothers, James son of 
Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their 
fishing nets. He called them. 
22|Right away they left the boat and their father and 
became his disciples[f]. 
23|He began to go about the entire region of Galilee 
teaching in the[g] synagogues and proclaiming the good news[h] of the kingdom and 
treating[F] any kind of and all sorts of diseases and any kind of and all sorts of 
maladies[G] among the people. 
24|News of him spread throughout the whole 
region of Syria. They brought to him all kinds of people[i] having something wrong with 
them…various kinds of sicknesses, those suffering or in pain[j], the demon-possessed, 
epileptics, paralytics…and he treated everyone. 
*[a]countryside…Lit: wilderness
*[b]Isaiah’s prophecy…Lit: word through Isaiah
*[c]straighten up and change your ways…Lit: repent
*[d]became his disciples…Lit: followed him. Of note is the difference in verb tense between this and Mark 
14:13, where Jesus said, Follow him. In 14:13, following is a one-time event. Here in Matthew, it’s an 
unbounded action.
*[e]pair of…Lit: two
*[f]became his disciples…Lit: followed him
*[g]the synagogues…Lit: their synagogues
*[h]good news…Lit: gospel
*[i]all kinds of people…Lit: all people. This is a figure of speech called a synecdoche.
*[j]suffering or in pain…Lit: tormented

*[A]tempted…In the GT, tempted here implies having to pass a series or a program of trials, tests, and 
temptations, loosely analogous to a ship which must pass sea trials before it can be certified as fit for 
use
*[B]placed him on the battlements on the temple roof…The temple complex sits on a hilltop in the center 
of Jerusalem, the highest point in the city central. The temple reaches high in the sky and overlooks the 
temple mount and its courtyard bustling with crowds. The temple is crowned with a golden, decorative, 
pointy battlement around the perimeter of its roof. The GT refers to this battlement in v. 5, and its perch 
would’ve allowed one to see a panorama of the temple, the city, and the surroundings of Jerusalem. 
*[C]sitting in a region where they were under a shadow of death…Lit: sitting in a region and a shadow of 
death. A figure of speech enhancing the metaphor rendered under the shadow of death
*[D]Be my disciples…in the GT literally reads go behind me, and is normally translated come follow me. This 
phrase in the GT is close in wording to Matt. 16:23, Get behind me; both imply subordination.
*[E]quit being fishermen…Lit: they left their nets. The Gk. word for nets in v. 20 is a different word than 
what is used for nets in v. 18. The nets in v.18 describe a specific type of fishing net; the nets in v. 20 is 
the general word for any kind of net. The word nets as used in v. 20 is a figure of speech meaning that 
Peter and Andrew retired from fishing. A contemporary figure of speech in the setting of a western 
novel would be that of a sheriff who “hangs up his gun”—he retires from being sheriff. Likewise they 
hung up their nets implies that they hung them up, never to take them down again. In any case, it 
doesn’t necessarily mean that Jesus shouted to them and they literally dropped the nets they had been 
casting in v. 18.
*[F]Treating…in the Gk. NT means healing, casting out demons, or what-not—doing whatever it takes to 
remedy the patient
[G]Maladies…this word is typically translated infirmities, weaknesses, or afflictions. It’s a strange or 
unknown or lingering type of sickness. With modern medicine, we’re accustomed to root-causing and 
thereby categorizing any kind of disease, but in ancient times, people became sick for no apparent 
reason. This kind of sickness is a malady.

Matthew
25|Large crowds from Galilee, 
Decapolis, Jerusalem, the Jordan, and from the other side of the Jordan followed him 
around.


&MATT 5
1|Now seeing the crowds, he hiked up the mountains[a], and upon seating 
himself, his disciples came to him. 
2|He opened his mouth and proceeded to teach 
them in a long, cohesive sermon[b]:


3|Blessed are the poor, spiritually-speaking[c],[A]
Since the kingdom of heaven consists of them.


4|Blessed are the mourners[B],
Since they shall be comforted.


5|Blessed are the self-restrained, soft-spoken ones[C],
Since they shall legitimately lay claim to
And take hold of[D] the earth.


6|Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
Since they’ll be satisfied.


7|Blessed are the merciful,
Since they’ll be shown mercy.


8|Blessed are those with clean hearts,
Since they’ll see God.


9|Blessed are the peacemakers,
Since they’ll be called Sons of God.


10|Blessed are those who’re persecuted for doing right[d],
Since the kingdom of heaven consists of[e] them.


11|Blessed are you when you are insulted,
And you are persecuted,
And when they say all sorts of bad things about you
On account of believing in me.

12|Be joyful and exult in that joy[f],
Since your heavenly paycheck is huge—As you know,
They persecuted the Former Prophets the same way.

          
13|”You are the salt of the earth. If the salt were to become insipid, by what 
means can its saltiness be reinstated? It’s not potent[g] enough anymore for any use, 
except to be thrown out, to be treated by others with utter contempt.[E] 
14|You are 
the light of the world. A city on a mountaintop cannot be hidden, 
15|nor do you 
light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but rather on the lampstand, and it puts out light 
for all those in the house. 
16|So in this way, let your light shine before men, that 
they would notice the good things you do and glorify your heavenly Father.
          
17|”Don’t think that I came to nullify the Old Testament[F]—no, not to 
nullify, but to fulfill. 
18|You can count on this: until planet Earth comes to an end, 
there’s no way—no way at all—that even so much as the tiniest letter or a single stroke 
of the pen which distinguishes one letter from another in any of the commandments 
found in the Old Testament Law of Moses will be disregarded or of no effect, until that 
day when everything finally comes to an end. 
19|Whoever tries to disregard even 
the minutest commandment and instructs others to do the same thing will be ranked 
last in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever happens to do and teach these 
commandments, that’s the fellow who’ll be called ‘great’ in the kingdom of heaven. 

20|Indeed—I’m telling you, if your scorecard isn’t better than the designated 
teachers’[h] and the Pharisees’, there’s no way—no way at all—that you’re getting into 
the kingdom of heaven.
          
21|”You’ve heard that it’s written in Scripture somewhere[i], ‘Do not murder; 
whoever commits murder will be pronounced guilty in that great, unseen courtroom.’ 

22|But what I say is this: whoever gets irate with his good friend[j] will be 
pronounced guilty in that unseen courtroom. So whoever calls his friend an idiot[G] will 
be guilty enough to be sentenced to the fires of hell[k]. 
23|Take this to mean that if 
anyone is on his way to a church conference and happens to remember that his friend is 
holding a grudge against him, and that it’s his fault and not his friend’s, 
24|stop 
dead in your tracks and go straight to your friend and fix it with him first, then you can 
go back and continue on your way to church.[H] 
25|Settle with the plaintiff out of 
court. Don’t let it go to trial, because when the judge swings his gavel, 
26|you’re 
going to lose your shirt.[I]
          
27|”You’ve heard the verse from the Old Testament, ‘Don’t commit 
adultery.’ 
28|But what I say is this: anyone who checks out a woman thinking what 
she’d be like in bed has already committed adultery with her in his heart.[J] 
29|If 
your right eye (that is, the object of your continual desire) is causing you to commit sin, 
dig it out and throw it away; you’re better off for sure losing one of your body parts and 
not having your whole body thrown into hell. 
30|If your right hand (that is, the 
thing you’re in the habit of doing) is causing you to commit sin, cut it off and throw it 
away; you’re better off for sure losing one of your body parts and not having your 
whole body thrown into hell.[K]
          
31|”You’ve heard the verse from the Old Testament, ‘Whoever chooses to 
divorce his wife must supply her with the required divorce certificate.’[L] 
32|But 
what I say is this: divorcing your wife for any reason except in the case of sexual 
immorality[l] causes her to commit adultery when she remarries, and whoever remarries 
after having divorced is an adulterer.
          
33|”Again, you’ve heard that it’s written in Scripture somewhere, ‘Do not 
swear an oath which is bogus. You will fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’ 
34|But what 
I say is this: don’t swear oaths at all—
35|Not by the earth, because it’s God’s 
footstep, not in Jerusalem, because it’s the city of the great king. 
36|Don’t swear an 
oath by your head, because you can’t turn even one of your hairs grey[m] or turn it back 
to its original color. 
37|But let your word in each matter be a simple ‘yes, yes’ or ‘no, 
no’—anything beyond that is of an evil origin[n].
          
38|”You’ve heard the verses, ‘An eye for an eye’ and ‘A tooth for a tooth.’ 

39|But what I say is this: don’t resist a bad person, but instead, whosoever slaps 
you on the right cheek, turn and present the other one to him also (i.e., don’t change the 
way you treat the person who mistreated you and seek retaliation).[M] 
40|And any person 
whatsoever who’s wanting to sue you for your shirt and pants, give him your overcoat 
also. 
41|And whosoever conscripts you to carry their pack for a mile, continue on 
with him for two.[N] 
42|Give to him who asks something from you, and whoever 
wants to borrow money from you, don’t turn him down.
          
43|”You’ve heard the verse, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your 
enemy.’ 
44|But I say this: love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you; 

45|for in doing so you will follow in the footsteps[o] of your heavenly Father; you 
see, the sun rises upon the bad and good and rain falls upon the righteous and 
unrighteous. 
46|Indeed—if you only love those who love you, what kind of 
payback[p] do you get for that? Don’t even the tax collectors (i.e., the rank sinners) do 
that? 
47|And if you greet your good friends only, how much of a better person are 
you by doing this? Even the Gentiles do these very things, don’t they?
          
*[a]the mountains…Lit: the mountain. Singular used as plural, like in Luke 1:39
*[b]in a long, cohesive sermon…the phrase he opened his mouth in conjunction the Gk. verb tense of to 
teach in the rendering he proceeded to teach insinuates this interpolation
*[c]poor, spiritually-speaking…Lit: poor in spirit
*[d]for doing right…Lit: on account of righteousness
*[e]since the kingdom of heaven consists of them…Lit: since of them is the kingdom of the heavens
*[f]be joyful and exult in that joy…Lit: rejoice and exult
*[g]potent…Lit: strong
*[h]designated teachers’…Lit: the scribes’
*[i]written in Scripture somewhere…Lit: written by the ancients
*[j]good friend…Lit: brother
*[k]Fires of hell…Lit: the hell of fire, a figure of speech
*[l]sexual immorality…Lit: fornication, impl.: adultery
*[m]grey…Lit: white
*[n]of an evil origin…Or: from the evil one
*[o]follow in the footsteps…Lit: might become sons
*[p]payback…Lit: wages

*[A]Poor, spiritually-speaking (Lit: poor in spirit) is one who does not think himself or herself to have 
enough of God, to have a close enough relationship with Jesus, to have enough of the presence of the 
Holy Spirit, to name a few
*[B]Mourners…In this context they are those who have a deep sorrow, to the point of grief—the same 
grief experienced when a loved-one passes away—when they do wrong; when they want more of God; 
when they intercede for others who’re away from God; when they pray for those in authority, knowing 
the troubles that are in the world; for their own complacency; for their own callousness; the list goes 
on…
*[C]self-restrained, soft-spoken ones…Lit: gentle; mild; meek. Meek appears in the KJV; modern 
translations prefer gentle. When Matthew quoting Jesus wrote “the meek shall inherit the earth,” the 
GT which Matthew wrote is a near-verbatim copy of the GT of Ps. 37:11 in the LXX. Studying the context 
surrounding Ps. 37:11 gives the interested party a broader understanding of what Jesus had in mind 
when he spoke those words. In any event, meekness can be described as the absence of the pushiness, 
the obnoxious attitudes, the belligerency, the quickness to retaliate, the harsh words and sharpness of 
tongue, the carnal loudness, the eagerness to step on others in order to promote self, etc. In the 
absence of these emerges that gentle demeanor called meekness.
*[D]legitimately lay claim to and take hold of…Lit: inherit. Ref. note of Luke 10:25.
*[E]to be treated by others with utter contempt …Lit: trampled underfoot by men. This is a NT idiom 
meaning misused, abused, disrespected by others and put in subordination to them. Ref. Matt. 7:6; Luke 
21:24; Rev. 11:2.
*[F]the Old Testament…Lit: The law and the prophets. The literal reading from the GT is what they called 
the Old Testament in Jesus’s day
*[G]idiot…Lit: raka. One of the few Aramaic words appearing in the NT. It borders on cursing.
*[H]on your way to church…Liberties taken in the translation to make it more relevant; vv. 23,4 actually 
read, Therefore if anyone were to an offering upon the altar offering and remember that his has brother 
has something against you, leave the offering in front of the altar, turn back first and be reconciled to 
your brother, then come bring forth the offering. Over the course of the year, Jews were required to 
journey to the temple in Jerusalem and offer up a sacrifice of various kinds at the altar on the temple 
premises. The trip to Jerusalem could take a few days, unlike going down the street a few blocks to get 
to church.
*[I]you’re going to lose your shirt…Liberties taken in the translation to make it more relevant; vv. 25,26 
actually read, Make peace with your adversary quickly, while you’re still with him on the way, lest the 
adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the bailiff [attendant], and you will be thrown 
into jail. Verify I say to you, you will not get out until you’ve given out the last cent. This describes a civil 
action decided by a judge with no jury. Back then, those who didn’t have the money to pay the entire 
settlement the judge determined would be thrown into jail immediately.
*[J]has already committed adultery with her in his heart…A misunderstood verse, easily clarified when a 
bit of common sense is applied. In no way is staring carnally at another woman equivalent to or as 
morally wrong as having sex with her. The point Jesus is making is that both the ogler and the adulterer 
are transgressors of the law; committing either breaks a stainless record. But the difference between 
the two is like the difference between a light misdemeanor and a high class felony—and distinctions in 
the severity of transgressions is a concept adhered to elsewhere in the Bible.
*[K]if your right eye/if your right hand is causing you to commit sin…In the Bible, eyes are symbolic of the 
heart’s desire and hands are symbolic of actions you take. The right eye is the principal desire of the 
heart, and the right hand is the most important thing that you do. This passage, symbolic and not literal, 
means to aggressively and decisively eradicate any bad desires in your heart or eliminate any habits, 
actions, involvements, etc. if any of these is a principal cause of you committing sin.
*[L]the required divorce certificate…Under OT Law/the Law of Moses, as quoted here, divorce was 
permitted. By law, the husband could (but the wife could not) initiate the legal proceedings for the 
divorce and, if approved, was required to supply her with a divorce certificate to protect her reputation, 
her legal, and her moral standing. In this day and age, the laws for divorce are applied equally to 
husbands and wives, therefore Jesus’s commandment applies equally to both sexes as well. So in v. 32, 
which reads, divorcing your wife for any reason except in the case of sexual immorality makes her 
commit adultery, and whosoever remarries after having divorced is an adulterer, the case of the 
husband is treated differently than the case of the wife, as the husband was permitted by law to initiate 
a marriage and to initiate a divorce. The wife could only ascent to it or acquiesce to it. Therefore, their 
situations are different, and Jesus speaks to both separately. In modern times, we would simply say, 
whoever gets a divorce and remarries (except in the case of sexual immorality) commits adultery.
*[M]whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn and present the other one to him also (i.e., don’t change 
the way you treat them and seek retaliation)…”An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” was OT law; 
the same was also embedded in Hammurabi’s law code. If someone wrongs you, you have the legal right 
of retaliation, the right to get even. For mankind, this is natural law; “turning the other cheek” is 
therefore a point of contention for many. A couple things to consider. First, the point Jesus was making 
is that you don’t have to retaliate when you’re wronged. He didn’t mean that you shouldn’t protect 
yourself against those who try to harm you. Second, read Acts 23:1-10, where Paul was actually slapped 
on the cheek, and ask yourself, “Did Paul turn the other cheek?” Same thing for Acts 16:37: when Paul, a 
Roman citizen, had been illegally beaten, he demanded his rights. Also see Acts 22:25.
Turning the other cheek is to present the same “face”—the same disposition—which you presented 
previously. Don’t change your disposition based on the way people treat you. For example, an employee 
is working at a retailer. While the employee is politely explaining a company policy, the customer 
behaves rudely. The employee turns the cheek when he continues to show politeness after the 
customer behaves badly. An example of turning the other cheek is when Joseph decided to divorce Mary 
(Matt. 1:19): he chose to do it quietly rather than to retaliate by making a stink about it.
Turning the other cheek is not as extreme and uncommon as it appears. In fact, even non-Christians turn 
the other cheek from time to time. Waitresses who are treated rudely by their customers but continue 
to be polite to them are turning the other cheek.
*[N]whosever conscripts you to carry their pack for a mile, go on with him for two…By law, if a Roman 
soldier passed one going the opposite direction, by law he was permitted to force him to carry his pack 
for him for a mile.
[O]don’t fall short by only doing things halfway, do them all the way …Lit: be perfect. Perfect is also 
translated complete or finished; a complete person fulfills the full intention of God’s laws and not just 
the letter of it, what appears on the surface, or what is left over when corners are cut. Perfect is used in 
v. 48 here the same way it’s used in James 1:4.

Matthew

&MATT 6
1|”Do not practice your faith[A] around people[a] in order to be seen by them; 
otherwise, you won’t get any benefit[b] from your heavenly Father. 
2|Like, when you 
break open your checkbook in order to give to the needy[c], don’t cue up a drum-roll[d] 
like the hypocrites in the synagogues and out on the streets do, in order that they’ll be 
applauded by those around them. That’s all the benefit they’re going to get[e], for sure. 

3|When you give to the needy, keep your cards close[f], 
4|so that your contribution 
is made secretly. And your Father, who sees all which is done in secret, will pay you 
back.
          
5|”Now, when you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites, as they just love taking a 
stand to pray while they’re in the synagogues and on the street corners, in order to be 
noticed by those around them. That’s all the benefit they’re going to get, for sure. 

6|But what you should do when you pray is go into your bedroom[g] and close the door 
behind you, in order to pray in secret to your Father. And your Father, who sees all 
which is done in secret, will pay you back. 
7|Don’t babble or mumble on and on when 
you pray, like people do everywhere, as they think their prayers will be answered 
because of the sheer volume of words that they use. 
8|Don’t imitate them. Indeed, 
your Father knows what you’re in need of before you pray to Him. 
9|So pray this 
way:

“Our Father up there[B]:
Let Your reputation be held in reverence.

10|Have Your involvement with us (Your kingdom)[C] advance.
Have Your will come to pass:
As it is in heaven, have it be done on earth.

11|Give us a meal ticket for today[D],

12|And let our debts slide
As we let slide what’s due us.

13|And don’t take us over into temptation[E]
No—rather, rescue us from the bad stuff[F] that goes on[G].


14|”The fact is, if you forgive the wrongs that others do to you, your heavenly 
Father will forgive you of your sins also. 
15|But if you don’t forgive the wrongs 
others do to you, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you of your sins.
          
16|”Now, when you fast, don’t get all down and out like the hypocrites, as 
they look miserable[h] so that everyone will know that they’re fasting. That’s all the 
benefit they’re going to get, for sure. 
17|But when you’re fasting, put on a happy-
face[H], 
18|so that you don’t appear to those around you to be fasting, but instead 
will be seen fasting by your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees what’s done in 
secret, will pay you back.
          
19|”Don’t stash stuff here on earth, where it rusts out and where burglars 
break in and steal it, 
20|but stash stuff in heaven[i], where it won’t be eaten by 
moth, won’t tarnish or rust, and burglars can’t break in and steal it. 
21|For where 
your stash is, is where your heart will be also.
          
22|”The eye (what a person is fixated on) is the body’s source of light (its 
guidance system; its ability to guide according the light of God), its lamp[I]. When your eye’s 
in good working condition, everything in the entire body gets illuminated (the light which 
your eye provides will be passed to your entire body). 
23|But if your eye malfunctions[j], 
everything in your entire body will go dark. So then if the light injector in you goes out[k], 
the darkness will permeate throughout your body.
          
24|”No one can serve two bosses; he’ll either hate the one and love the 
other, or he’ll stick to the one and disrespect the other. You can’t serve both God and 
the almighty dollar[l].
          
25|”Throughout all, I tell you, don’t worry about your life, what you’re 
going to eat[m], nor for your body, if you’ll have clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than 
eating and the body more than having something to put on? 
26|Take a look at the 
birds—they don’t plant crops and harvest them, storing them away—and your 
heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not cared for[n] more than them? 
27|Who 
among you who worries can add even a minute[o] to the length of his lifespan? 

28|And why do you worry about clothing? Learn a lesson from how the lilies in 
the field grow: they neither wear themselves out working nor do they spin thread for 
clothing. 
29|But I say that not even Solomon in all of his splendor was ever decked 
out like one of them. 
30|If the grass of the field—here today, tossed into a furnace 
tomorrow—God has thus clothed, how much more will He clothe you, you little-faith-
ers? 
31|So now, don’t worry saying, ‘What are we going to eat? What are we going 
to drink? What are we going to wear?’ 
32|People everywhere, all over the world, 
seek after these things; indeed—your heavenly Father can see that you need all of these 
things. 
33|But seek first the things concerning God’s interaction with mankind 
(God’s kingdom) and its right-doing[p], and all these will be added to you. 
*[a]around people…Lit: before men
*[b]benefit…Lit: reward
*[c]give to the needy…Lit: give alms
*[d]cue up a drum-roll…Lit: have a trumpet blown before you. Liberties taken.
*[e]that’s all the benefit they’re going to get…Lit: they received their reward in full
*[f]keep your cards close…Lit: don’t let your left hand know what your right hand’s doing
*[g]bedroom…Lit: closet. Liberties taken.
*[h]look miserable…Lit: don’t let their faces shine
*[i]stash stuff in heaven…Impl: accumulate spiritual material, not natural
*[j]malfunctions…Lit: is evil
*[k]out…Lit: dark
*[l]the almighty dollar…Lit: mammon, Aramaic for money
*[m]what you’re going to eat…Some manuscripts add, Or what you’re going to drink, some don’t
*[n]cared for…Lit: carried about
*[o]a minute…Lit: a cubit[a foot/30 cm]
*[p]right-doing…Lit: righteousness

*[A]practice your faith…Lit. practice your righteousness. Implied that it’s the observance of a prescribed 
religious act, the religion in this case specified by the Law of Moses
*[B]Up there…Lit: in the heavens, an abstract place somewhere up the sky and beyond. God is up there, 
somewhere, not exactly sure where, but He’s up there
*[C]Your involvement with us (Your kingdom)…God’s interaction with mankind (God’s kingdom)…Your 
kingdom, the kingdom of God, enter God’s kingdom, or some other variation of the same is an idiom 
first promulgated by Jesus himself. Some confusion arises if we simply take the phrase at face-value 
instead of taking it as an idiom. The face-value meaning steers us in the direction of a person either 
becoming a Christian or not; either gaining access to heaven in the afterlife or not; etc. The meaning of 
this idiom is understood by studying the usages in the NT, since it is used copiously. One example is Acts 
14:22, …succeed in their life of faith (enter God’s kingdom). Notice how Acts 14:22 is encouraging those 
who are already believers to enter the kingdom of God.
*[D]meal ticket for today…Lit: Sustenance [at-existence] Bread. Note the Gk. word for sustenance namely 
epiousios (ἐπιούσιος/Strong’s 1967) only appears in the NT here and in Luke 11:3. According to Origen, 
this word was coined by Matthew and Luke; tradition maintains that it means “necessary for existence.” 
The root ousia (οὐσία/Strong’s 3776) means “substance, state, condition, being, essence”; although the 
prefix epi (ἐπί/Strong’s 1909) can mean several things, it’s assumed to mean “at” in this word. (Gk. 
prefixes do not always modify the meaning of the root word in a predictable way.) But it’s entirely 
plausible that at-existence is more precisely rendered sustenance, which is the meaning of epiousios 
passed down by tradition. Bread is a synecdoche for food in general, as, up until the last century or so, 
the majority of caloric intake of the average person came from starches—bread, rice, potatoes.
*[E]Take us over into….from the GT, the picture of us being on a bus or something and God is the bus 
driver, and He takes us wherever. The word temptation refers to temptation as we know it but also 
refers to tests and trials that could break us.
*[F]Bad stuff…Lit: the evil. Refers to all of the wrong, all of the bad, and all of the evil that goes on in this 
world.
*[G]Rescue us from the bad stuff that goes on…Some early manuscripts of Matthew were corrupted with 
the insertion of the phrase, For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.(KJV), 
which is called the Lord’s Prayer Doxology, and is apparently a reference to 1 Chron. 29:10–13. This is a 
spurious addition; Jesus never said this.
*[H]put on a happy face…Lit: anoint your head and wash your face. In the OT and in ancient times in 
general, people applied oil to their bodies as an ointment, a protective lotion, as a soap-like cleanser, or 
as a skin enhancer. This is what anoint your head refers to. Also, the head and the face have symbolic 
meanings. The head refers to what you’re thinking and the face refers to your disposition and attitude.
[I]the eye (what a person is fixated on) is the body’s source of light (its guidance system), it’s lamp…In 
ancient Israel, in the average home there was a single room where the inhabitants gathered when it got 
too dark to see. In that room, they illuminated a single lamp or candle and placed it on a lampstand in a 
central location, where it effectively filled the entire house with light. In addition, in the Bible the eye 
symbolizes one’s fascinations, desires, meditations, fixations, thoughts, etc. In English, we speak 
symbolically too, in statements like, “I’ve got my eye on that new Escalade®.” Furthermore, in the NT, 
the body refers to not just the physical body but can also refer to the physical appetites and the physical 
actions we take. Together, these explain what Jesus meant in this passage. Also, ref. John 11:9,10.

&MATT 7
1|”Don’t judge (i.e., draw conclusions about people so as to write them off[A]), so 
that you won’t be judged yourself. 
2|In fact, by the judgment which you use to judge, 
you will be judged.[B] 
3|Why do you see the splinter in your fellow comrade’s[a] eye 
but haven’t noticed the plank in your own? 
4|Put another way, just how are you 
going to say to your comrade, ‘Here, let me take that splinter out of your eye,’ and—
hello—there’s a plank in your eye. 
5|Hey, hypocrite, first take the plank out of your 
own eye, and then you’ll be able to see well enough to take the splinter out of your 
comrade’s.
          
6|”Don’t give what’s sacred to dogs (which are despicable animals), nor cast your 
pearls right in plain sight in front of pigs, lest they have utter contempt for them[C], turn

7|”Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door 
will be opened for you. 
8|You see, everyone who asks receives; everyone who seeks 
finds; everyone who knocks has doors opened for him. 
9|Put another way—what 
man is there among you, if his son were to ask him for a loaf of bread, would hand him 
a stone? 
10|Or if he were to ask him for a fish, would hand him a snake? 
11|So 
if you all, being lying, cheating, stealing, selfish folk[b], know to give good gifts to your 
children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask 
Him? 
12|So then, the way you’d like for people to treat you is the way you should 
treat them; this in fact is what the Bible teaches[c].
          
13|”Enter through the narrow gate, since the gate is wide and the way is 
broad which leads to destruction, and many are they who entered in through it. 

14|How narrow is the gate and how tight is the way which leads to life, and few

15|”Beware of the evil impersonators of prophets, those who come to you 
looking[d] like sheep, but on the inside are voracious wolves. 
16|You’ll come to 
recognize them from their fruit. You don’t get grape clusters from thorn bushes or figs 
from thistles. 
17|In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the tree 
which is rotten bears bad fruit. 
18|A good tree can’t bear bad fruit, nor can a rotten 
tree bear good fruit. 
19|Every tree not bearing good fruit is cut down and thrown 
into a fire. 
20|Yes indeed, you’ll recognize them by their fruit.
          
21|”Not everyone who says to me ‘Lord, Lord’ will enter and participate in[e] 
the kingdom of heaven, but rather he who does the will of my heavenly Father. 

22|Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy on your 
behalf?[D] And by your authority cast out demons? And under your authority perform 
many miracles?’ 
23|Then I’ll confess to them, ‘I was never acquainted with[f] you. 
Depart from me, you who won’t be restrained by the rules of God or of man[E]’.
          
24|”So now, everyone who hears my words and does them is just like a 
sensible man who built his house on rock[g]. 
25|Rain came down, creeks 
overflowed their banks[h], the wind blew—These beat against the house, and it did not 
collapse, since its foundation had deliberately been laid on rock. 
26|And everyone 
who hears my words and does not do them is just like a stupid man who built his house 
on sand[i]. 
27|Rain came down, creeks overflowed their banks, the wind blew—
These beat against the house, and it collapsed. And its collapse was pretty spectacular.”

*[d]looking…Lit: dressed
*[e]enter and participate in…Lit: enter into. This is an idiom; ref. note of Acts 19:8.
*[f]never acquainted…Lit: never knew
*[g]on rock…Lit: on the rock
*[h]creeks overflowed their banks…Lit: the rivers came
*[i]sand…Lit: the sand
*[j]had taught…Lit: his teaching

*[A]draw conclusions about people so as to write them off…Lit: don’t judge. (Also, ref. note of Luke 6:37.) 
The word judge as used in the Bible means one of the following: ascertaining guilt or innocence, in or 
out of an actual courtroom; the verdict reached from such deliberation; the resulting sentence; a 
combination of these. This is evident upon examining how the word is used in both the OT and NT. In 
the case of 7:1 here, judging refers to the verdict reached from deliberation but does not refer to the 
ascertaining of guilt or innocence; hence, the misunderstanding of what Jesus is saying here. Many who 
read “don’t judge” here in 7:1 understand it to mean that Christians should refrain from ascertaining 
guilt or innocence, i.e. they shouldn’t decide whether another person’s deeds are moral or immoral, and 
to make such decisions brings judgment upon ourselves. Not only does this contradict common sense 
but it’s not consistent with other teaching of the NT. It’s the case of building a doctrine on one verse of 
Scripture and not taking all of Scripture into consideration. Those who wrote the NT lived in the times of 
Jesus and were either spent much time around him (and conversed in the same native language), were 
taught directly by him, or had contact with those who did. Had Jesus meant that Christians shouldn’t 
ascertain moral guilt or innocence of others, then their writers would reflect that. But their writings do 
not. In other words, Paul’s epistles violate the notion that “don’t judge” means one shouldn’t look at 
another Christian and decide if what they’re doing is right or wrong. For example, Paul wrote these 
statements in 1 Cor. 5, For I verily as absent in body but present in spirit, hath judged already, as though 
I were present, concerning him that hath done this deed (v. 3)…I wrote unto you in an epistle not to 
company with fornicators (v. 9)…But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that 
is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an 
extortioner; with such an one no not to eat (v. 11)…For what have I to do to judge them also that are 
without? Do not ye judge them that are within? (v. 12)…But them that are without God judgeth. 
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person (v. 13). Paul also wrote reprove, rebuke, 
exhort (2 Tim. 4:2). Paul rebuked Peter (Gal. 2:11–21).
*[B]by the judgment in which you judge, you will be judged…The GT reads krimati krinete krithāsesthe, 
(κρίματι κρίνετε κριθήσεσθε) which has a ring to it, like something you might see written on a church 
billboard…“Get all you can, and can all you get”…“Get right or get left.” Jesus uses humor instead of a 
scolding in this verse and in the verses which follow.
*[C]have utter contempt for them…Lit: trample them by their feet. This is an expression in the Bible (ref. 
note of Matt. 5:14; Luke 21:24) which means to treat with contempt. In the mind of ancient Jews, dogs 
were dishonorable animals; pigs were filthy and disgusting, designated as unclean by the Law of Moses. 
Verse 6 is telling us not to give what we treasure most to filthy, unworthy people. They’ll just have 
contempt for it, then, knowing you’ve entrusted them with something you shouldn’t have, use it to turn 
on you.
*[D]on your behalf…Lit: in your name. In your name is a phrase in the NT which means, as authorized by 
you or on behalf of you or in favor of you (ref. Acts 4:17–20).
*[E]you who won’t be restrained by the rules of God or of man…Lit.: those working the lawlessness. Though 
lawlessness comes in many shapes and forms, Jesus views lawlessness here as though it originates from 
the same source, and, when you get right down to it, it is all really the same thing. When the NT refers 
to a person who’s lawless, it means one who’s unrestrained by the law of the land; by restrictions 
specified in the Bible; by godly rules of conduct; by accepted moral practices; by common decency. This 
covers a wide swath of peoples …pirates who sailed in hunt of prey…philosophers who spread contempt 
for Christian morals…those who drive like maniacs all the time…drug addicts who leave syringes on the 
street.
*[F]For he taught in a captivating manner…Lit: for he was teaching them like someone who has authority. 
It means that Jesus took command of their attention and that the minds of those in the crowd weren’t 
wandering. He kept their attention with commanding rhetoric, with persuasiveness, with humor, with 
rhetorical questions that pierce the heart, with the right mix of sternness and gentleness, with colorful 
figures of speech, by the use of imaginative allegories and examples.
[G]as their designated teachers…Lit: as the scribes. As the Scribes were the OT experts, they were tasked 
with delivering sermons to the large audiences. As experts in the Law, they decided matters of doctrine.

Matthew

29|For he taught in a captivating manner[F] and not like their

&MATT 8
1|After he came down out of the mountain, large crowds followed him. 

2|Out of nowhere, a leper came up to him and started groveling in front of him,
      “Sir[A], if you so desire, you can clear me up[B].”
          
3|He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I do so desire; be 
cleared.”
Immediately his leprosy cleared up. 
4|Jesus then said to him, “See to it that you tell no 
one, but rather go and show yourself to the priest and bring to him the offering that’s 
commanded by the Law of Moses, as an official submission[a] to them for certification 
that the leprosy no longer exists.”
          
5|After he entered Capernaum, an army captain came up to him pleading with 
him,
          
6|“Lord, my servant is bedfast, suffering terribly of paralysis.”
          
7|On top of the situation, Jesus said, “I’ll go heal him.”
          
8|The captain then replied, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to set foot in my 
house. Just give the word, and my servant will be healed. 
9|You see, I’m a man who’s 
used to living under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this one 
‘Come here!’ and he comes; I tell my servant ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
          
10|Once he heard this, Jesus was just amazed, and said to his followers, “I’m 
really telling you, I haven’t found anyone in Israel who has so much faith. 
11|I tell 
you, lots of folk will come from way far away[b] and room will be made for them[c] 
alongside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 
12|But the chosen 
people[d], namely the Israelis, will be tossed out into the Outer Darkness—a place where 
there’ll be weeping and gnashing of teeth[C].”
          
13|Jesus said to the captain, “Go your way; as you’ve believed, so let it 
happen to you.”
          
14|Jesus entered Peter’s house and saw his mother-in-law bedfast with a 
high fever. 
15|He touched her hand and the fever left her. 
16|When evening 
arrived, they brought to him many demon-possessed, and he cast the spirits out with a 
few words, and he treated many who had something wrong with them[e], 
17|in 
order that the Prophet Isaiah’s prophecy would be fulfilled,

He himself took our weaknesses
And bore our diseases

          
18|Now Jesus, seeing a crowd surrounding him, gave a command to hike up 
the mountain. 
19|One of the designated teachers[f] came and said to him,
      “Teacher, I’ll follow you wherever you happen to go.”
          
20|Jesus, following up the statement, said, “The foxes have dens and the 
birds have nests, but the Man[D] (i.e. the Son of Man) has no such place where he can get 
away from it all[g].”
          
21|Another, who was one of his disciples, said, “Let me go from here and 
bury my father[E] first.”
          
22|Jesus, following up that statement, said, “Follow me; let the dead bury 
their own dead.”
          
23|Then he got into a boat and his disciples followed him in. 
24|And—
like that—the sea broke into a great commotion, to the extent that the boat was 
overshadowed by waves. All the while, he was still asleep. 
25|They came over and 
roused him from his sleep saying,
      “Lord—Help! We’re dying here!”
          
26|He said to them, “What a bunch of chickens you all are, you little-faith-
ers,”
He then got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm came over the 
water. 
27|The men were amazed and said, “Just what kind of guy is this, that even 
the wind and the sea obey him?”
          
28|After he arrived on the other side, in the Gadarene region, he was 
accosted by two demon-possessed men coming out of the tombs—really dangerous 
men—so much so that no one was tough[h] enough to pass through on that road. 

29|Out of nowhere, they cried out, “We have no beef with you[F], Son of God—have 
you come here before the appointed time to torment us[i]?” 
30|Now off in the 
distance, a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
31|The demons begged him, “If you’re 
going to cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 
32|He said to them, “Proceed.” 
So they exited the men, went out and entered the pigs. Like that, the whole herd 
stampeded over the cliff and into the sea and died in the water. 
33|All the 
herdsmen began to flee, and when they got to the city, they spread the word about 
everything that happened, including what happened to the demon-possessed men. 

*[a]an official submission…Lit: a witness
*[b]from way far away…Lit: from the Easts and from the Wests
*[c]room will be made for them…Lit: they’ll be seated [will recline]
*[d]the chosen people…Lit: the sons of the kingdom, i.e., the Israelites
*[e]who had something wrong with them…Lit: maladies
*[f]designated teachers…Lit: scribes
*[g]where he can get away from it all…Lit: to lay his head
*[h]tough…Lit: strong
*[i]appointed time to torment us…The verb tense in the word torment here implies a one-time act of 
torment, not the start of a never-ending or eternal torment.
*[j]leave the area…Impl: cross over the border to the next district

*[A]Sir…Also: lord. The word lord here does not refer to the lordship of Jesus Christ the Son of God, but is a 
term of respect used when addressing nobility or when addressing someone with authority who has no 
formal title or if their specific title is unknown.
*[B]you can clear me up…Lit: you can make me clean. According to OT law, if anyone showed any signs of 
leprosy, they were designated unclean. The word unclean derives its meaning from the OT concepts of 
clean and unclean, which besides being applicable to leprosy applies to many hygienic, etc. conditions. 
In the NT, the concepts of clean and unclean are extended to spiritual conditions. But in this passage, 
the leper must be certified (the certification additionally requiring a sacrificial offering) as clean by a 
priest in order to be readmitted back into society. Should he have but a little leprosy, he’ll fail 
certification; the leper is therefore asking for a total removal of the leprosy.
*[C]Weeping and gnashing of teeth…a biblical phrase, partly to be taken literal, partly not.
*[D]the Man…Lit: Son of Man. This is a phrase that has its origins in the OT, particularly Ezekiel. The Bible 
embeds family members into phrases, like son of perdition, father of lies, call wisdom your sister, etc. In 
the Bible the phrase son of means someone who’s a perfect example, who faithfully personifies, or 
who’s the epitome or the total embodiment of a concept, ideal, or state of being. Son of man means 
several things. It means the perfect man; one who has the full spectrum of human qualities alive and 
fully functioning in himself; a sort of Renaissance man; a single specimen who’s the most suitable 
representative for the human race; a person who stands in proxy for all human beings; a person of 
character and ability; and in this context, the Man. All these describe Jesus.
*[E]bury my father…this is likely an expression and a hyperbole, and means that you have urgent business 
to attend to, but not to be taken literally that your father just died. (Some say it instead means that that 
your father is still alive and you have to wait for how many years for him to pass away.) After all, one of 
the Ten Commandments is to honor your mother and father, and Jesus would not tell the disciple to 
violate a commandment of that magnitude, and one is applicable in NT times as well. If bury my father is 
an expression indeed, then Jesus’s reply Let the dead bury their own dead is a play on that expression. 
The “dead” Jesus refers to are the spiritually dead; the expression therefore means, “Let the spiritually 
dead take care of their own pressing matters.”
[F]We have no beef with you…Also: how do your affairs concern us?; leave us alone…Lit: what to us and 
to you? A NT phrase, also found in Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34, 8:28; John 2:4.

Matthew
*[F]We have no beef with you…Also: how do your affairs concern us?; leave us alone…Lit: what to us and 
to you? A NT phrase, also found in Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34, 8:28; John 2:4.

Matthew
34|Then and there—the whole city came out to meet up with Jesus for the purpose of 
talking to him, and seeing him, they pleaded with him to leave the area[j].


&MATT 9
1|He got into the boat, crossed over, and arrived at his hometown. 

2|Momentarily, they brought him a paralytic laid up on a cot. Jesus, seeing their faith, 
said to the paralytic, “Cheer up there, son, your sins have been forgiven.” 
3|Then and 
there, some of the designated teachers[a] said among themselves, “This guy’s 
blaspheming.” 
4|Reading their lips[b], Jesus said to them, “Just why are you chewing 
over[c] evil in your hearts? 
5|What here’s easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or ‘Get 
up and walk’?…
6|But in order for you to know for sure that the Man[d] has the 
authority on earth to forgive sins”—He then turns and says to the paralytic, “Get up, 
take your cot and go back home.” 
7|So he got up and went back home. 
8|Seeing 
this, a solemn reverence[e] came over the crowd, and they glorified the God who gives 
authority such as this to mankind.
          
9|Now as Jesus continued on from there, he saw a man sitting at the customs 
table named Matthew and said, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. 

10|And when he happened to be lounging at the dinner table[A], out of nowhere 
several tax collectors and other kinds of sinners came and joined Jesus and his disciples at 
the table. 
11|The Pharisees, seeing this, proceeded to say to his disciples,
      “Just why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other kinds of sinners?”
          
12|He heard it and said, “Those who’re doing well don’t need a doctor, but 
the unwell do. 
13|Find out what this means[f]: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’ You 
see, I didn’t come to summon the righteous but sinners instead.”
          
14|Then John’s disciples came to him, “Just why do we and the Pharisees 
fast all the time, but your disciples don’t fast?” 
15|Jesus said, “The groom’s 
guests[g] can’t mourn at the same time that they’re with the groom. But there’ll come a 
day when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they’re going to fast. 

16|No one patches the hole in an old garment with an un-shrunken patch, since the 
filler material will pull away from the garment, and you’ll be left with a worse hole. 

17|Nor does anyone put freshly-squeezed grape juice into old wineskins; 
otherwise, the wine skins will tear and the wine will spill out, and the wine skins will be 
ruined. Instead, they put grape juice into new wineskins, and both will be kept intact.”[B]
          
18|While saying these things, out of nowhere a synagogue head came and 
began pleading with him saying, “My daughter just passed away—but now, if you 
come and lay your hand on her, she’ll live again.” 
19|Jesus and his disciples got up 
and followed him. 
20|And, quite abruptly, a woman who had a hemorrhage for 
twelve years came up behind him and touched the hem of his garment; 
21|for she 
kept saying to herself, “If I could just touch his outer garment, I’ll get better.” 
22|So 
Jesus turned, looked at her, and said, “Cheer up, ma’am[h]: your faith has come to the 
rescue[i].” And the woman was delivered[j] from her illness that moment.
          
23|After Jesus came to the synagogue head’s house and saw the flute 
players and the wailing crowd, 
24|he went among those there saying, “Leave. Fact is, 
the girl’s not dead—she’s sleeping.” 
25|When the crowd was thrown out, he went 
in and took hold of her hand, and the girl[k] got up. 
26|And his fame spread 
throughout the entire surrounding area[l].
          
27|Continuing on from there, two blind men followed Jesus, crying out, 
“Have pity on us, you wonderful godsend[m].” 
28|Arriving at the house, the blind 
men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” They 
then say to him, “Yes sir.” 
29|Then he touched their eyes while saying, “In 
accordance with your faith, let it come to pass,” 
30|and they regained their sight. 
Jesus firmly charged them, “Don’t let anyone know,” 
31|but they left from there 
and talked all about it in the entire surrounding area.
          
32|While they were heading out, they brought to him a deaf, demon-
possessed man. 
33|After the demon had been cast out, the deaf man spoke. As the 
crowd was amazed, the rumor kept on being repeated, “This has never been seen before 
in Israel.” 
34|But the Pharisees went around saying, “It’s by means of the head 
demon that he casts out demons.”
          
35|Jesus went about to all the cities and towns, teaching in the local 
synagogues and proclaiming the good news[n] of the kingdom and healing all kinds of 
diseases and all kinds of infirmities. 
36|Seeing the crowds, he felt deeply sorry for 
them because they were beaten down and defeated, like sheep that have no shepherd. 

37|In line with this, he then said to his disciples, “Though the harvest is big, there 
are but a few workers. 
*[a]designated teachers…Lit: scribes
*[b]reading their lips…Lit: seeing their thoughts. Some liberties taken.
*[c]chewing over…Lit: turning over
*[d]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note in Matt. 8:20.
*[e]a solemn reverence…Lit: they feared
*[f]find out what this means…Lit: go learn what it is
*[g]groom’s guests…Lit: sons of the bridegroom
*[h]ma’am…Lit: daughter. Short for daughter of Israel presumably, which has a similar meaning as 
daughter of Jerusalem, etc. These terms refer to women who have a position in society.
*[i]come to the rescue…Lit: saved [rescued] you
*[j]delivered…Lit: saved
*[k]girl…Lit: teenage girl
*[l]the entire surrounding area…Lit: that land
*[m]you wonderful godsend…Lit: David’s son. Ref. note of Matt. 12:23.
*[n]good news…Also: gospel
*[o]dispatch…Lit: cast out

*[A]lounging at the dinner table…Lit: they reclined in the house. In the next sentence, the tax collectors and 
other kinds of sinners came and joined Jesus and his disciples at the table…Liberties taken. People back 
then laid on couches in a circle while eating a meal, and took their time at it. There was actually no 
dinner table as we know it.
[B]both will be kept intact…In the examples of the patch and the wineskins, Jesus says that you must 
match the one to the other, the patch to the cloth, or the wine to the wineskins. A mismatch won’t 
work. Jesus’s ministry was, before the cross, a time of joy and of celebration for the human race. It was 
appropriate for his disciples to match this with joy and partying of their own. On the other hand, John’s 
ministry was one of austerity, and it was appropriate for his disciples to follow suit.

&MATT 10
1|…And[A] summoning his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over filthy, 
disgusting[a] spirits, so that they would cast them out and go about healing all sorts of 
sicknesses and all sorts of infirmities. 
2|The names of the twelve missionaries[b] are: 
first and foremost Simon, who’s called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of 
Zebedee and his brother John; 
3|Phillip and Bartholomew; Thomas and the tax 
collector Matthew; James the son of Alpheus; Thaddeus; 
4|Simon the Cananaean[B] 
(Cananaeans are also called “the Zealots”); and Judas Iscariot, the one who’ll betray 
him.
          
5|Jesus sent out these twelve telling them, “Don’t go down a road leading to 
another country, and don’t go into the Samaritan cities;[C] 
6|rather, go for the down-
and-out[c] of Israel. 
7|While you’re going about, proclaim, ‘God’s involvement with 
mankind (the kingdom of heaven) just got here!’ 
8|Heal those who are weak with 
sickness, raise the dead, clear up[d] the lepers, cast out harassing spirits (demons), 
receive offerings, give offerings. 
9|Don’t get cash[e] for your wallets[f], 
10|nor take 
a carry-bag for the road, nor take two changes of clothes, two sets of sandals, or two 
staffs, since the worker deserves his meal[D]. 
11|Whichever city or town you pass 
through, find out if anybody in it has an open heart and will listen, and stay there until 
you decide it’s time to leave[g]. 
12|So now, when you enter a house, extend a hearty 
welcome signaling your good, sincere intentions and your willingness to receive their 
hospitality as cooperative guests.[h] 
13|Now, if those in the household are receptive, 
follow through with the good intentions you extended to them and accept their 
hospitality. But if they aren’t, let it end at that and move on;[h] 
14|whoever won’t 
receive you nor listen to your words, when you leave that city or town, wipe the dirt off 
the bottom of your feet[E] as a gesture which says “we’re done with you.” 
15|I’ll tell 
you—the day of judgment will be easier on Sodom and Gomorrah than on that city.”
          
16|”Here now, I send you all out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be as 
wise as a serpent but as innocent as a dove.[i] 
17|Beware[j] of people[k], since they’ll 
hand you over to the judicial council[l], and they’ll flog you in their synagogues. 

18|And you’ll be brought before not only leaders but before kings on account of 
me, in order to testify to them and to the nations. 
19|But when they arrest you, 
don’t memorize what you’re going to say—something to say will just come to you[m] at 
that moment. 
20|You see, it won’t be you who’re doing the talking but the Spirit of 
your Father speaking through you. 
21|Now, a brother will betray a brother to his 
death, and a father his child, and children will take sides[n] against their parents. 

22|And everyone will hate you on account of me. But the one who perseveres until 
everything is said and done—that sort of guy will survive. 
23|When they persecute 
you in this city, flee to the next. Mark my words—you won’t get to finish going through 
the cities of Israel between now and when the Man[o] comes.
          
24|”A disciple is not over his teacher, neither is a slave over his master. 

25|If a disciple reaches his teacher’s level and if a slave his master’s, then he’s done 
a good enough job. If the head of the organization goes by the name ‘Lucifer’ (i.e. 
Beelzebub), how much greater the extent of the corruption and evil will be for those who 
are members of the organization?
          
26|”So now, don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing that has been 
concealed that will not be revealed, and there is no secret that won’t become known. 

27|What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light, and what is whispered in 
your ear, proclaim on the rooftops. 
28|Don’t be afraid of them killing your body; 
they can’t kill your mind, your will, your very being[p]. Be more fearful of the one who 
can destroy both soul and body in hell. 
29|Two sparrows cost a dollar, right? Yet 
neither will fall to the ground without our Father having any part of it. 
30|In your 
case, all the hairs of your head have been counted. 
31|So don’t live in fear: you’re 
worth more than a whole lot of sparrows put together.
          
32|”So then, everyone who affirms[q] me in front of people, I will also affirm 
him before my heavenly Father. 
33|But whoever disavows[r] me in front of people, I 
will also deny him before my heavenly Father. 
34|Don’t think that I came to 
sprinkle peace all over the earth—no, I didn’t come to sprinkle peace, but I came to 
sprinkle violence[F]. 
35|Indeed, I came to divide…

*[e]cash…Lit: gold or silver or copper
*[f]wallets…Lit: money belt
*[g]until you decide it’s time to leave…Lit: until you would leave
*[h]So now, when you enter a house, extend a hearty welcome signaling your good, sincere intentions and 
your willingness to receive their hospitality as cooperative guests (etc)…Lit: Now coming into the house, 
greet it. And if that house indeed is worthy, let your peace go upon it. But if it’s not worthy, let your 
peace return to you. Multiple figures of speech used in this passage. The word peace has a similar, 
idiomatic type of usage in Acts 15:33; Heb. 11:31; James 2:16.
*[i]so be as wise as a serpent but as innocent as a dove…Lit: so be as prudent/sensible as the serpents but 
as pure as the doves. Note that the Gk. word sophos (used for wise) (σοφός/Strong’s 4680) isn’t used 
here, as sophos also means cunning.
*[j]Beware of…Impl. also: keep your distance from
*[k]people…Lit: the men; also means: society, body politic
*[l]judicial council…lit: Sanhedrin
*[m]will just come to you…Lit: be given
*[n]take sides against…Lit: rise up
*[o]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note in Matt. 8:20.
*[p]your mind, your will, your very being…Lit: soul
*[q]affirms…Lit: confesses
*[r]disavows…Lit: denies
*[s]life…Lit: soul: mind, will, very being
*[t]destroying…Also: ruining
*[u]perish…Also: deteriorate

*[A]And…Chapter 10 is a continuation in the narrative from chapter 9. Jesus sends the twelve out because 
of the compassion he felt and said in 9:36,37
*[B]The Cananaean…Also called the Zealots. These were a sect of Jewish partisans and revolutionaries.
*[C]Don’t go into the Samaritan cities…Jesus’s mandate was only for the nation of Israel. Post-crucifixion, 
that mandate was expanded to include every human being on the planet. The reason God limited Jesus’s 
mandate to Israel only is that it was the most he could do at the time.
*[D]the worker deserves his meal…It was only a few years ago that, if a worker came to work at your house 
for the day, he didn’t bring his own lunch because he and any other workers would expect to be 
provided lunch. As refrigerator, preservatives, packaging, etc. only came into being in the last several 
decades, prior to this it was a necessity to partake in the large-scale meal preparation of a household 
you visited as a worker.
*[E]wipe the dirt off the bottom of your feet…The significance to the Jews of wiping the dirt off your feet is 
that you are clean and they are unclean and that the OT Law prohibits you from having any contact with 
that which is unclean. You therefore mark them unclean. Ref. Mark 6:11; Acts 13:51; Acts 18:6.
*[F]to sprinkle violence…Lit: but rather a sword. The word sword in the NT has a few similar but 
nevertheless distinct meanings, depending on the context. In this context, it means violence, but it’s a 
metaphor to physical violence and not the solicitation of such violence per se.
*[G]loves…The word used for love here is phileō (φιλέω/Strong’s 5368), not agapaō (ἀγαπάω/Strong’s 25). 
Phileo is a high degree of comradery, an enjoyment of another’s fellowship. The command is to not have 
greater phileo for your family, not agapā (ἀγάπη/Strong’s 26).
[H]He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s wage (etc.)…Lit: He who 
receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s wage, and he who receives a 
righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s wage. Just as Jesus 
commands his disciples in this chapter to go about from place to place and to have their material needs 
met at the places they visited, those who itinerate in this manner—prophets in this case—are also 
expected to live off the generosity and patronage of those in the cities who welcomed them. The word 
receive used here refers to those who take in and shelter such a prophet, provide him with meals while 
he’s stays with them, and clothe him, if necessary. These gifts of food, shelter, and clothing are the 
prophet’s “wages” referred to in this passage. What it means to receive a prophet in the name of a 
prophet is to welcome and support that prophet simply out of respect for his calling and his ministry and 
not because of his charisma, his personality, a personal like or dislike of the prophet himself, or other 
such reasons. Those who provide this sustenance will themselves receive back a “prophet’s wage”: a 
payback blessing from God in the form of material goods in this lifetime and, in addition, of spiritual 
rewards in the life to come. 

Matthew
*[H]He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s wage (etc.)…Lit: He who 
receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s wage, and he who receives a 
righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s wage. Just as Jesus 
commands his disciples in this chapter to go about from place to place and to have their material needs 
met at the places they visited, those who itinerate in this manner—prophets in this case—are also 
expected to live off the generosity and patronage of those in the cities who welcomed them. The word

rewards in the life to come. 

Matthew
42|Whoever gives a drink—even if it’s just a little cup of cold water—to even the 
most insignificant of disciples simply because he is a disciple, know for sure that his 
wages for doing so won’t perish[u].”


&MATT 11
1|When Jesus had finished commissioning his twelve disciples, he went about 
from there teaching and proclaiming in the neighboring cities. 
2|When John, who was 
in jail, heard about Jesus’s doings, he sent word to Jesus by way of some of his disciples, 

3|asking,
      ”Are you the Coming One, or shall we wait for somebody else?”
          
4|Jesus came up with an answer and replied, “Go tell John what you’re seeing 
and hearing: 
5|the blind are regaining their sight, the crippled are walking, lepers are 
being cleared of their leprosy, the deaf are hearing again, the dead are being 
resurrected, the poor are hearing encouraging news[a]. 
6|A man is blessed if he doesn’t 
get in the wrong regarding me.[A]”
          
7|While these disciples were on their way back to John, Jesus began to talk to 
the crowds about John, “What did you go out into the countryside[b] to get a look at? A 
twig fluttering in the breeze?—
8|No. What did you go out to see? A man decked out 
in a pricey suit?[c]—Look around—the ‘beautiful people’ are over in the ritzy side of 
town[B]. 
9|No, not that either. What did you go out to see—a prophet? Yes—and let 
me tell you—the greatest prophet ever. 
10|He’s the one this verse talks about,

“Here now, I’ll send you my messenger—
He’ll get right in your face.
He’ll block off the roads for the route that you’ll take[d].


11|”I’m telling you for certain: out of all those who’ve ever been born, no one 
greater than John the Baptist has come to the forefront[e]. But the most insignificant 
person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
12|From the days of John the 
Baptist until now, God’s involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven) has been 
subjected to those acting with aggressive, reckless decisiveness[f], and those acting with 
aggressive, reckless decisiveness[g] are seizing it.[C] 
13|The fact is, everything in the 
Old Testament[h] up until this time has prophesied about John. 
14|And if you are 
willing to take it for what it is,[D] he himself is Elijah-to-come.[E] 
15|A word to the 
wise is sufficient.[F]
          
16|”Just what shall I compare the prevailing Zeitgeist[i] to? It’s like when one 
group of children sitting in the marketplace calls over to another group of children 
nearby 
17|saying…[G]

“We played a catchy flute tune, but you didn’t dance.
We sang a dirge, but you didn’t weep and wail[H].


18|”John, you see, was all about fasting[j], and you all say ‘He’s got a demon.’ 

19|The Man[k] has lots of parties[l], and you say, ‘Take a look at the party animal 
here[m]. He just loves tax collectors and other kinds of sinners.’ Wisdom is vindicated to be 
just that—wisdom—by the end-result.[I]”
          
20|He then began to rip on the cities that had had the most miracles, 
because they didn’t repent. 
21|”Bad move, Chorazin! Bad move, Bethsaida! 
Because if Tyre and Sidon had had the miracles that you had had, they would’ve had a 
change in heart and conduct by doing the burlap-and-ashes-thing[J]. 
22|Because of 
that, the Day of Judgment will be easier on Tyre and Sidon than on you all. 
23|And 
as for you, Capernaum…

You wouldn’t have anything to do
With being raised up to heaven;
You were bent on sinking down into hell

“And if Sodom had had the miracles which you had had, they would still be here today. 

24|Because of that, the Day of Judgment will be easier on the land of Sodom than 
on you.”
          
25|Around that time, Jesus reflected from out of the depths of his heart, 
“With my lips I pour my heart out in confession to you, Father of heaven and earth, 
because you hid these things from the wise and the intelligent and revealed them to 
newbies. 
26|Indeed, Father, it pleases you to have things unfold this way before 
Your very eyes[n]. 
27|You’ve entrusted all things to me, my Father. No one 
precisely knows the Son except for the Father, nor does anyone precisely know the 
Father except for the Son and to whom the Son purposes to reveal Him. 
28|Give 
me all your tired, your overloaded. To you, the tired and overloaded, I’ll give rest. 

29|Take up my manner of living and adopt my ways, that I’m self-restrained, soft-
spoken, and humble deep inside, and you’ll find rest for your inner-being.[K] 

*[a]hearing encouraging news…Lit: hearing the gospel
*[b]countryside…Lit: wilderness
*[c]decked out in a pricey suit…Lit: dressed in soft clothing
*[d]the route that you’ll take…Lit: he’ll prepare your road in front of you
*[e]has come to the forefront…Lit: has been raised up
*[f]aggressive, reckless decisiveness…Lit: suffers violence; taking a thrashing. An idiom; ref. note of Luke 
16:16.
*[g]those acting with aggressive, reckless decisiveness…Lit: the violent
*[h]the Old Testament…Lit: the Prophets and the Law
*[i]Zeitgeist…Lit: generation. A generation in this context refers to a Zeitgeist or a class of people or a 
clique who are of the same mindset. It does not specify a span of time per se, as those who are like-
minded may span multiple human generations.
*[j]John was all about fasting…Lit: John came neither eating nor drinking
*[k]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref .note of Matt. 8:20.
*[l]the Man has lots of parties…Lit: the Son of Man came eating and drinking
*[m]take a look at the party animal here…Lit: behold—a man who’s a glutton and a drunkard
*[n]before your very eyes…Lit: before you

*[A]Get in the wrong regarding me…Or: get bent out of shape over me…Lit: stumble by me. In the Bible, to 
stumble is an idiom which points to and identifies the root-cause of making a mistake (whether the 
mistake is intentional or unintentional is irrelevant) and thereby committing a sin; to do wrong; to fall 
short of the mark; or to be offended by what’s right.
*[B]ritzy side of town…Lit: behold—all those wearing soft [clothing] are in the houses of the kings. Some 
liberty taken here and in v.8 to make the passage more relevant to modern times.
*[C]subjected to those acting with aggressive, reckless decisiveness …Lit: suffers violence only partly refers 
to physical violence, but only partly. In the NT, the violence is not so much physical—except for the 
persecution aspect. Other aspects of this violence are alluded to in the previous chapter when Jesus said 
that he didn’t come to sprinkle peace but to bring a sword (Matt. 10:34), and that parents will be set 
against their children, etc. The kingdom of heaven suffers violence not only at the hands of unbelievers 
but suffers violence at the hands of believers, those believers who by radical conversions, strong 
convictions, disregard for their own self, who pray fervently and endlessly, who give until it hurts, who 
forgive even when it hurts—those are the violent ones who are seizing it.
*[D]to take it for what it is…Lit: And if you’re willing to receive it this once. See the scrutiny this passage has 
been subjected to, the justification for tacking the words this once onto this literal translation here is 
that the infinitive receive in this verse is an aorist infinitive. By default, infinitives are usually present 
tense, so Matthew added some additional nuance in flipping this infinitive from present to aorist before 
committing it to writing.
*[E]he himself is Elijah to come…there’s heated debate over whether Jesus is saying in this verse that John 
the Baptist is Elijah reincarnated or not. I do not have a dog in this fight. However, it cannot be 
overstated just how important John the Baptist’s ministry was. Furthermore, Elijah personifies prophecy 
in the face of apostasy. John raises that to a higher level. The apostasy by the Jewish leadership at the 
time of Christ was at an all-time high. Judgment followed soon after.
*[F]A word to the wise is sufficient…Lit: He who has an ear, let him hear. It means: you who are willing to 
take heed, pay attention or you’ll miss something.
*[G]another group of children nearby, saying…Mothers bring their children along to the marketplace, and 
as the mothers are busy looking over the produce, or perhaps catching up on the latest news, the 
children wander off a bit, sit and wait for their mothers. The children congregate in groups and, as time 
passes, grow bored and restless and want to play a game of some sort to entertain themselves and pass 
the time. The more children who play, the more fun the game, so the first group of children tries to 
recruit the second in their frivolities. But the second group is not interested in playing. The first group, 
desperate to break the monotony, seeks to entice the second group with something—anything—which 
appeals to them, so long as they’ll get up and start to play with them. They attempt two opposite games 
that appeal to two opposite moods, figuring that one of them will be appealing to the second group.
*[H]weep and wail…Jesus quotes what the first group of children says to the second after the second 
refused all their attempts to get up and play with them. Both of the games were emotional and 
exhilarating. The first game was a dance: someone would play the flute and everybody would dance. 
The second game was a sad song: someone would sing a dirge and everybody would pretend that 
they’re at a funeral. At first, this seems to be an unusual game to play, one that would be no fun at all. 
This is not the case; extreme emotions are entertaining regardless how morbid they may be. This is the 
same reason why teens like horror movies and zombie apocalypse movies, or movies with a lot of 
bloodshed. They cover their eyes during the gory scenes, but peak a bit. By the same measure, sad 
movies and sad songs—though not as popular as they used to be—are also entertaining. Years ago, 
teenage girls used to bring a box of tissues with them for when they cried through a sad movie. 
*[I]Wisdom is vindicated to be just that—wisdom—by the end-result …Lit: Wisdom is justified by her works. 
It means that you can tell if something was a smart thing to do or a smart way of living by the end-result 
of theory put into practice.
*[J]burlap-and-ashes-thing…In the OT, those who repented showed their sincerity by the self-abasement 
of dressing in sackcloth, which is similar to burlap, and by sitting in ashes. They did this for days at a 
time.
[K]Take up my manner of living and adopt my ways, that I’m self-restrained, soft-spoken, and humble 
deep inside, and you’ll find rest for your inner-being. You see, my manner of living is easy and my 
difficulties are mild…Lit: Take up my yoke upon yourselves and learn from me, that I’m meek and humble 
in heart, and you will find rest for your soul. For my yoke is easy and my load is light. The metaphor is to 
oxen pulling a load. (Also ref. note of Matt. 5:5 for definition of meek.) Oxen have the strength to pull 
heavy loads but can only pull such loads if a yoke is properly fitted and placed on them. An analogy for 
us is moving furniture which is difficult to move. Though the furniture is heavy, the problem with moving 
it has more to do with the difficult shape and size of the furniture, the inability to get a good grip on it, 
the amount of twisting and turning necessary—all these more so than the weight itself.

&MATT 12
1|During that period of time, Jesus walked through the fields on Sabbath days. 
The disciples were hungry and began to go through and strip kernels off[A] the wheat 
heads and eat them. 
2|But the Pharisees, seeing what was happening, said to him,
      “See, look what your disciples are doing. This isn’t allowed on the Sabbath.”
          
3|And he said to them, “Did you ever read about what David did—not only he 
but everyone with him—when he got hungry, 
4|how he entered the house of God and 
ate the Showbread[B], which was forbidden for either him or those with him—for 
anyone except the holy priests—to eat? 
5|And didn’t you read in the Old Testament[a] 
about how the priests who attend to the holy things of the temple get away with 
violating Sabbath law? 
6|I’m telling you, there’s something here that’s more 
important[b] than the temple. 
7|But had you been familiar with what this means, ‘I 
want mercy and not sacrificial offerings,’ you wouldn’t condemn those who are 
innocent. 
8|To sum it all up, the Man[c] is the Sabbath’s master.”
          
9|After he left from there, he went into one of the local synagogues. 

10|There happened to be a man there with a shriveled-up[C] hand, so they asked 
him, “Are we allowed to perform healings on the Sabbath?”, in order to find something 
to accuse him of.[D] 
11|He answered, “Is there anyone you know of who, if one of 
his sheep were to fall into a gorge on a Sabbath day, wouldn’t go grab it and pull it out? 

12|So now, how much more valuable is a person than a sheep?—What I’ve said is so 
much the case that it’s permissible to do heroic deeds on the Sabbath.” 
13|He then 
turned to the man and said, “Stretch your hand out.” He stretched his hand out, and it 
was restored to a state of well-being like the other hand. 
14|After the Pharisees left, 
they convened a meeting about how they proposed to eliminate him. 
          
15|After Jesus made that known, he left from there. Many followed him, 
and he healed all of them. 
16|He charged them to not let the word out about him, 

17|so that Isaiah’s prophecy would be fulfilled,


18|Look! My chosen child,
My beloved in whom My soul is pleased.
I’ll put My Spirit upon him
And announce justice to the nations.

19|He’ll neither squabble nor scream
Nor will anyone hear his voice in the town square.

20|He won’t break a damaged twig,
He won’t extinguish a wick
Until he brings about a victory for justice,

21|And those far off[d] will have hope through him[e].

          
22|Then they brought to him a blind, mute, demon-possessed man, and he 
treated[f] him, resulting in the mute man talking and seeing. 
23|The entire crowd 
was amazed and was going about saying, ”Isn’t this fellow the marvelous godsend 
we’ve been waiting for all these years[g]?” 
24|But when the Pharisees heard about 
this, they said, “This guy can’t cast out demons except through the help of the demon 
chief Beelzebub.” 
25|Knowing what they were really thinking, he said, “Every 
kingdom which is divided from within will go to waste, and every city or house 
divided from within won’t stand. 
26|If Satan casts out demons[h], he’s divided from 
within. So if that is the case, how will his kingdom stand? 
27|And if I cast out 
demons with the help of Beelzebub, with the help of whom[i] do your protégés[j] perform 
exorcisms? By the outcome of this matter, they, your protégés, will determine whether 
you’re right or wrong[k]. 
28|But if I cast out demons by the help of the Spirit of God, 
then God’s interaction with mankind (God’s kingdom) has come crashing down on 
your heads[l]. 
29|Put another way…how can someone break into a tough guy’s 
house and take his stuff, unless he firsts subdues the tough guy? If he manages to do that 
then and only then will he ransack his house. 
30|Whoever’s not for me is against me. 

31|Throughout all, I’m telling you that people will be forgiven of any kind of[m] sin 
and blasphemy, but blaspheming the Holy Spirit[E] will not be forgiven. 
32|And 
whoever says something against the Man[c] will be forgiven, but whoever says 
something against the Holy Spirit won’t be forgiven, from now until the end of time[n].
          
33|”Put another way…take good care of the tree[o] and it’ll bear good fruit. 
Let the tree turn rotten[p], and its fruit will be rotten. You see, it’s by the condition of the 
fruit that you’ll know about the condition of the tree. 
34|You collection of vipers 
who are inbred in your thinking[q], how can you speak good, seeing that you’re evil? 

35|A good person speaks from out of the goodness stored up inside of him, and a 
bad person blurts out evil from out of the evil stored up inside of him. 
36|I’ll tell 
you one thing: a person will have to appear in court one day[r] to answer[s] the charges 
leveled against him for every slip of the tongue that he ever makes. 
37|And there, 
you’ll be declared innocent by[t] your words, and you’ll be declared guilty by your 
words.”
          
38|Then some of the designated teachers[u] addressed him, and Pharisees 
too, “Teacher, we want you to perform a spectacular miracle[v].” 
39|Jesus replied, 
“An evil and adulterous collection of inbred thinkers wants a miracle done for them, 
but no miracle will be done for them except for the Prophet Jonah’s miracle. 
40|For 
just as Jonah was in the leviathan’s stomach for three days and three nights, in the same 
way the Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. 
41|The 
people of Nineveh will take the witness stand and testify against these inbred thinkers[F] 
because they repented as a result of Jonah’s preaching. Take a look—something greater 
than Jonah is here. 
42|The Queen of the South will confront those inbred thinkers 
and take the witness stand and testify against them because she came from the other 
side of the planet[w] to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and—take a look—something greater 
than Jonah is here.”
          
43|”Now when the demonic spirit[x] leaves a person, it travels from place to 
place over an uninhabitable, inhospitable landscape, seeking a place where it can take 
up residency and isn’t able to find one. 
44|Then it says, ‘I’ll return and reenter the 
domicile that I originally left,’ and having returned finds it unoccupied, swept good and 
clean, and all tidied up.[G] 
45|It then goes and gets seven other evil spirits—more 
evil than itself—and they enter the person and settle in. The final state of that person 
will be worse than his original state. It’ll be the same way with this evil collection of 
inbred thinkers.”
          
46|While he was in the middle of telling the crowds this, his mother and his 
brothers showed up standing outside wanting to have a word with him. 

47|Someone told him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside 
wanting to have a word with you.”[H] 
48|He answered the fellow who told him 
this, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” 
49|He put his hand out on his 
disciples and said, “Take a look—my mother and my brothers.

*[D]something to accuse him of…According to OT law, the criminal prosecution of a violation of the Law of

to convict the accused. The judge determined that this was done in order. There was no jury.
*[E]blaspheming the Holy Spirit…Blaspheming the Holy Spirit is to reject, deny, or be in opposition to a 
miracle which was done by the power of the Holy Spirit and whose miraculous origin is manifest. As faith 
by nature is to believe in something which you cannot definitely prove in this natural world, having been 
confronted with natural evidence, yet still remaining hard of heart, is proof that one’s heart is so hard 
that he’ll never turn to God. This person will never ask for forgiveness, and God will never forgive them 
of their sin.
*[F]testify against these inbred thinkers…Lit: will stand up with this generation in the judgment and 
condemn it. Liberty taken to adapt the wording to a contemporary court proceeding. In the original text, 
Jesus portrays the Ninevites standing as witnesses and accusers against the Israelites.
*[G]all tidied up…Jesus outlines the principles by which demons (literally, unclean spirits) work. A demon 
leaves a man (v. 43) not because it wants to leave, but when that man resists it or when it’s cast out of 
him. He travels over “uninhabitable, inhospitable landscape.” This is not physical landscape but it’s a 
landscape of human beings. The demon is looking for another person to inhabit, which is what is meant 
in v. 43 by “seeking residency” (literally, rest). To enter a person, he dangles a suggestion in front of 
them, and they must take it, then it must grow, then he eventually enters them. The uninhabitable, 
inhospitable landscape (literally, dry places) consists of people who one by one reject the suggestions or 
subsequent advances of that demon. Having been rejected by others, in v. 44 the demon returns to his 
original host (literally, house).

&MATT 13
1|About that time, Jesus left his house and took a seat along the seashore. 

2|A large crowd gathered around him, to the extent that he had to get in a boat and 
cast out a bit and sit there instead, while the crowd stood along the shoreline. 
3|He 
used a lot of analogies when speaking. As an example he said, “Here now, the sower 
went out to sow. 
4|While sowing, it came to be that some of the seed fell on the path, 
and the birds came and ate it up. 
5|Other seed, though, fell on the rocks, where there 
wasn’t much soil. It sprouted quickly because of its lack of soil penetration. 
6|The sun 
rose and it became scorching hot, and it dried up because it wasn’t lodged deep in any 
soil. 
7|And other seed fell amongst the weeds, and the weeds shot up around it and 
choked it out. 
8|And still other fell on the good ground and grew to fruition, some 
yielding 30-to-1, others yielding 60-to-1, and still others yielding 100-to-1. 
9|A word to 
the wise is sufficient.[a]”
          
10|His disciples approached him and said, “Why do you speak to them in 
analogies?” 
11|He answered, “It has been granted to you to know the mysteries of 
God’s involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven), but to those other guys it 
hasn’t been given. 
12|So now, whoever goes about acquiring, it will be given to him 
abundantly[b]. But whoever is not acquiring, even that which he has will be taken away 
from him. 
13|I speak in analogies for this reason: so that ‘while seeing they will not 
see, and while hearing they will not hear’.[A] 
14|They fulfill the Prophet Isaiah’s 
prophecy, which says,

“While you all are hearing, you will not understand
(i.e., it’ll go in one ear and out the next)
And while seeing, you will see—
But you will not know of what you saw
(i.e., you’ll see it but you won’t get it).

15|Indeed, the heart of this people has thickened
And they have heard with bogged-down ears
And they have shut their eyes,
(i.e., they refuse to observe what’s going on around them)
Lest perchance they would see with the eyes
(i.e. they’d get a glimpse of what’s really going on)
And would hear with the ears
(i.e., listen attentively to what they’re being told)
And would understand with the heart and would turn back
And I would[c] heal them.

          
16|”Blessed are your eyes, because they can see and your ears because they 
can hear (i.e., you’re blessed because you do in fact observe what’s going on and will listen when 
you should). 
17|For a fact I tell you that many prophets and those whom I approved 
of[d] wanted to look upon that which you all see, and they did not experience knowing 
it, and to listen in on that which you hear, and they never heard it.
          
18|”You all listen, now, to what the parable of the sower is telling you. 

19|The Evil One comes and takes what was sown in the heart away from all who 
hear the word of the kingdom and do not understand it: this is what gets sown on the 
path. 
20|What gets sown among the rocks is the guy who hears the word and gets 
ahold of it right away, and with joy, 
21|but hasn’t established roots—in other 
words, is unstable and lacks perseverance. Once pressure or persecution on account of 
the word appears, right away he falls apart. 
22|What gets sown among the weeds 
is the guy who hears the word and the day-to-day[e] worries and anxieties and the self-
delusion[f] that money brings chokes out the word and it doesn’t yield anything. 

23|What’s sown on the good soil is the guy who hears the word and understands 
it, who—yes indeed—yields a crop, some at 100-to-1, other at 60-to-1, still other at 30-to-
1.”
          
24|He told them another analogy: “God’s involvement with mankind (the 
kingdom of heaven) is analogous to a man who sowed his field using good seed. 

25|Then while everyone was asleep, someone he was feuding with went in, 
planted crab grass[B] right next to all the wheat, then took off. 
26|When the stalks 
reached maturity, it became apparent that there was also crab grass. 
27|The 
owner’s workers came and told him,
      “‘Sir, didn’t we use good seed when we sowed the field? Where’d this crab grass 
come from?’
          
28|”He answered, ‘That guy I’m feuding[g] with did this!’
      “The workers said, ‘Ok then, some guy who hates you[g] did this. Do you want us 
to go gather it up?’
          
29|”He answered, ‘No, don’t, in case you uproot the wheat while gathering 
the crab grass. 
30|Let both of them grow up alongside each other until harvest time 
comes, and when harvest time comes, I’ll tell the harvesters, ‘First gather up the crab 
grass into bundles to be burned up. Collect the wheat, though, for my silo.’”
          
31|He told them another analogy: “God’s interaction with mankind (the 
kingdom of heaven) is analogous to a mustard seed, which someone took and planted 
in his field. 
32|While being the smallest of all seeds, when it’s full-grown, it’s 
bigger than the other crop-yielding plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds can 
come and nest in its branches.”
          
33|He told them another analogy: “God’s interaction with mankind is 
analogous to a packet of yeast, which a woman imbedded[h] deep in a batch of dough, 
around a couple bushels in size, and waited until the whole batch fermented.”
          
34|Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd by way of parables, and he 
didn’t say anything apart from using a parable, 
35|so that the Psalm[i] would be 
fulfilled,

I will open my mouth by means of analogy.
I will pour out of it
That which has been hidden from the beginning of time[j].

          
36|Then he let the crowds go home. His disciples went up to him and asked, 
“Explain to us the parable of the field’s crab grass.” 
37|He told them, “The sower of 
the good seed is the Man[k], 
38|the field is the world, the good seed is those who 
follow after God[l], the crab grass is those who follow the Evil One[l], 
39|the one he’s 
having a feud with is the Devil, the harvest is the consummation of the ages[m], and the 
harvesters are the angels. 
40|So just as the crab grass is bundled up and incinerated 
in a fire, it’ll be the same way in the consummation of the ages: 
41|the Man will 
send out his angels and from out of his kingdom they will bundle up all those who are 
all bent out of shape about this or that or who have succumbed to temptation[n] and 
those who break rules[o] which they shouldn’t, 
42|and they will toss them into a 
blazing-hot furnace[p], and in there, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth[D]. 

43|Then the righteous will radiate like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. A 
word to the wise is sufficient.
          
44|”God’s interaction with mankind (the kingdom of heaven) is analogous 
to a box of treasure buried on a plot of land which someone stumbles across and 
unearths and out of joy[q] goes out and sells everything he owns and buys that plot.
          
45|”Yet again, God’s interaction with mankind is analogous to a dealer in 
fine pearls, 
46|who, having found one extremely valuable pearl, went out and sold 
everything he owned and bought it.
          
47|”Yet again, God’s interaction with mankind is analogous to a fishing net 
cast into the sea which snared every imaginable kind of fish, 
48|which, after it had 
filled up, was hauled in and at the shore emptied out onto dry land. They took a seat and 
sorted out the good fish, putting them in a container, but threw out the bad fish, 
categorically rejecting them. 
49|This is the way it’ll be at the Eternal Gathering: the 
angels will disperse in every direction and pick out and remove the bad fish from 
among[r] the good fish, getting those bad fish out of the way, 
50|and will throw 
them into a blazing-hot furnace[p], and in there will be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth[C].”
          
51|”Do you understand all of these things?”
      They then tell him, “yes.”
          
52|He told them, “For this reason every one of the Scribes, our designated 
teachers, who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven behaves the same way 
that the manager of a large estate does, the very person who remembers where everything’s 
buried in storage and pulls new and old stuff out of storage[D] when the need arises.”
          
53|And when Jesus came to the end of speaking these parables, he left that 
place. 
54|After he arrived at the place where his kinfolk lived, he taught them in 
the local synagogue, resulting in them being astonished and going about saying,
      “’Where’d this guy get this here wisdom and the miracles[s]? 
55|Isn’t this 
guy the craftsman’s[E] son? Isn’t his mother the one called Mary and aren’t his brothers[F] 
James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? 
56|And his sisters—don’t they all live around 
here[t]? Just where did he get all this from?’”
          
57|And they got all bent out of shape about him. Jesus said to them, “There 
really isn’t any other place that a prophet is dishonored except among his kinfolk and in 
his hometown.”

*[A]While seeing they will not see and while hearing they will not hear…There are two sets of eyes and two 
sets of ears: the physical eyes and ears and the eyes and ears of the heart. As we say, that it “went in 
one ear and went out the next,” so Jesus has designated that some, though they hear his message, will 
only hear with their physical ears but won’t hear with the ears of their heart. If is because their heart is 
not receptive. Jesus’s message must go from the physical ears to the ears of the heart, in order to 
become effective. Jesus purposely prevents those whose hearts are hardened from receiving the 
message on the inside.
*[B]crab grass…The GT refers to a common, invasive weed-grass that afflicted wheat fields in that part of 
the world
*[C]weeping and gnashing of teeth…Ref. Matt. 8:12
*[D]pulls new and old stuff out of storage…What Jesus is saying here is that when a Scribe, those who were 
the experts in the Old Testament, becomes a true believer, then he’s like the manager who runs a 
house, presumably a large one, presumably one where there’s much land, many workers, etc. In this 
case, there’s a lot of tools, machinery, storage containers, etc. that are buried in closets, warehouses, 
etc. The manager had been there for years and had known about every item which was made or 
purchased, what condition it’s in, and where it’s stored. So, for example, if on the farm they need to lift 
a heavy rock or something, he thinks for a while and then tells everyone, “There’s and old rope and 
pulley buried in the back of the basement closet. Someone go fetch it, and we’ll use that to lift the rock.” 
That analogy is applied to the Scribe. He had done all this study and learned the ins and outs of many 
verses of Scriptures, so when his heart turns to the Lord, he’s able to retrieve old pieces of 
understanding that he learned years before in the same way as the manager would get some old tool 
out of the closet.
*[E]the craftsman’s son…From this verse many have concluded that Jesus was a carpenter. The Greek 
word means carpenter but also means craftsman. It’s likely that Jesus was both of these, that the master 
of the universe had many skills, that he was a jack-of-all trades; since craftsman is more general than 
carpenter, he should be called the former rather than the latter.
*[F]aren’t his brothers…This enumeration of his four brothers implies that these are all the brothers Jesus 
had
[G]refusal to believe…Lit: unbelief. In this context, unbelief is the stubborn refusal to believe what you 
should believe. In other contexts, the word unbelief may or may not involve this rebellious refusal to 
have faith. In cases such as this, unbelief is not believing simply because one is in ignorance.

1|In that timeframe, Governor Herod got a report about Jesus. 
2|He said to 
all those around him, “This is John the Baptist. He’s been raised from the dead, and that 
explains how he can work these miracles.” 
3|You see, on account of Herodias, his 
brother Phillip’s wife, Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him away in jail. 

4|This was because John kept on telling him, “It’s not lawful for you to be married to 
her.” 
5|Though wanting to kill him, he feared the masses, because they considered 
him to be a prophet. 
6|On Herod’s birthday, Herodias’s daughter performed a dance 
in front of everyone, 
7|resulting in him making an oath promising that he’d give her 
anything she asked for. 
8|Her mother nudged her to say, “Give me John the Baptist’s 
head on a platter.” 
9|The king became deeply upset because of the oath that he made 
in front of all his guests. He ordered that the request be granted, 
10|and he sent for 
John to be beheaded in jail. 
11|His head was brought on a platter and was given to 
the teenage girl, and she presented it to her mother. 
12|His disciples went there 
and took away his body, buried him, and went and told Jesus what had happened.
          
13|After Jesus heard about this, he left from there by boat to go some place 
out in the sticks to be alone. When the crowd heard, they followed him on foot from the 
cities. 
14|He went out and saw the great crowd and felt a deep inner compassion 
for them and cured all those who weren’t well. 
15|When it got late, his disciples 
came to him and said,
      “We’re out in the middle of nowhere, and it’s getting late. Dismiss the crowds so 
that they can venture out to the marketplaces in the surrounding towns and pick up 
something to eat.”
          
16|Jesus replied, “There’s no need to dismiss them—you give them 
something to eat.”
          
17|They then said, “We don’t have anything here except for five loaves of 
bread and two fishes.”
          
18|He said, “Bring them here to me.”
          
19|He had everyone in the crowd find a nice spot on the grass to relax[A]. He 
took the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up in the sky, gave thanks, broke the 
bread[B] and gave it to his disciples. 
20|Everyone ate and ate until they were full. 
They took away the leftover pieces of bread and filled up twelve baskets with them. 

21|Of those who had been fed, there were five thousand men, not including 
women and children.
          
22|Wasting no time, he urged his disciples to climb into a boat and go out 
ahead of him to the other side, while he, meanwhile, would dismiss the crowd. 

23|After he dismissed the crowd, he went by himself up a mountain to pray. When 
evening arrived, he was up there alone. 
24|The boat had already gotten more than 
a few miles away from shore, where it was being harassed by the waves, since there 
was a headwind. 
25|Around four or five in the morning, he went towards them 
walking on the water. 
26|When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they 
were startled and shouted, “There’s a ghost out there!”. 
27|Immediately Jesus said 
to them, “Relax, it’s me, don’t be afraid.” 
28|So Peter replied, “Lord, if it’s you, 
order me to come to you on the water.” 
29|Jesus said, “Come.” Peter got out of the 
boat and walked on water and went towards Jesus. 
30|Seeing the strong wind, he 
got scared and started to sink and shouted, “Lord, help, save me!” 
31|Immediately 
Jesus reached his hand out and got ahold of him and said, “Little-faith-er, why did you 
doubt?” 
32|After they got into the boat, the wind died down. 
33|Those in the 
boat bowed down low in homage before him saying, “You really are God’s son.”
          
34|Having crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. 
35|The men from 
that area, recognizing him, sent the word out to the entire surrounding area, and they 
brought to him everyone who wasn’t well. 
*[a]the edge of his shawl…Or: a tassel on his shawl

*[A]Relax…In the GT is literally recline. Folks back then laid down on couches when they ate, taking their 
time at it, enjoying the company of those they were eating with.
[B]broke the bread. Breaking a token piece of bread was the ritual back then before eating, something 
like tapping a champagne glass with a spoon before proposing a toast.

36|They were begging him, again and 
again, that they just be allowed to touch the edge[a] of his shawl, and everybody who 
touched it became completely well.


&MATT 15
1|Then some Pharisees and designated teachers[a] from Jerusalem arrived 
saying, 
2|”What’s the reason that your disciples disregard the rituals which have been 
handed down to us over the years,[A] seeing that they don’t ceremonially wash their 
hands before eating?” 
3|Jesus answered them, “What’s the reason that you disregard 
God’s commandment by means of your rituals, 
4|seeing that God said, ‘Financially 
support your mother and father’[B] and ‘Let he who bad-mouths his mother or father be 
put to death.’ 
5|But you all say, ‘Whoever says to his mother or father, ‘That payment 
which I was obligated to send you has instead been designated as an offering to God[C],’ 

6|is off the hook for sending funds to his father.’ 
7|Hypocrites—Isaiah was spot-on 
when he prophesied about you,


8|”This people honor me with their lips,
But they keep their heart far away from me.

9|In vain they worship me,
For teachings teaching man’s commandments.”

          
10|He summoned the crowd and said, “Listen up[b]— 
11|it’s not what 
goes into the mouth which defiles[D] a person, but what comes out of the mouth which 
defiles a person.” 
12|Then his disciples went over to him and said, “Did you know 
that the Pharisees were offended by what you said?” 
13|He came back with a 
response and said, “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be yanked 
out. 
14|Leave them alone: the blind are guides for the blind; both will wind up 
falling in a ditch.” 
15|Peter answered him, “Explain that analogy you just used to 
us.” 
16|He said, “You still don’t get it, do you? 
17|Don’t you know that 
everything which goes into the mouth passes through the stomach and ends up in the 
toilet? 
18|Those things which come out of the mouth come from the heart, and 
those are the things which defile a person. 
19|You see, out of the heart comes the 
contemplation of evil, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, thievery, lying[c], slander… 

20|These things defile a person, but not ceremonially washing one’s hands before 
eating won’t defile a person.”
          
21|Jesus left there and departed for the regions of Tyre and Sidon[E]. 

22|Out of nowhere, a Canaanite woman from that area came by and shouted, 
“Have mercy on me, sir, you wonderful man[d]. My daughter is severely demon-
possessed.” 
23|He didn’t say a word to her. His disciples went over to him and 
started saying, “Get rid of her.”
          
24|He replied to her, “I was only sent to tend to the down-and-out of 
Israel.”
          
25|So she came and prostrated herself in front of him and said, “Help me, 
sir.” 
          
26|Jesus replied, “It wouldn’t be right for me to take the Children’s Bread 
and cast it to the dogs.[F]”
          
27|She said, “Yes, but also, sir: the dogs are fed by the scraps which their 
masters drop from their tables.”
          
28|Then this produced a response with Jesus; he said, “Wow, is your faith 
huge, lady! As you desire, so let it happen.”
      …And her daughter was healed that moment.
          
29|Returning from there Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee, and took a seat up 
in a hill that is alongside it. 
30|A large crowd approached him, bringing with them 
their lame, blind, maimed, deaf & dumb, and many other such, and they laid them at 
his feet (i.e., they submitted them to his care), and he healed them, 
31|to the degree 
that the crowd was awe-struck in seeing the deaf & dumb speak, the maimed become 
well, the lame walk, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
          
32|Now Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have deep compassion 
for the crowd because they’ve been here with me for three days now and haven’t had 
anything to eat. I don’t want to dismiss them hungry, lest they pass out on the trip 
back.” 
33|His disciples chimed in,
      “Where in the middle of nowhere can we get all the bread needed to fill up such 
a large crowd?”
          
34|Jesus continued and said, “How much bread do you have?”
      They said, “Seven loaves plus a little bit of fish.”
          
35|He told the crowd to find a nice spot on the ground to relax on.[e] 

36|He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the bread, and gave it 
to his disciples. 
37|All of them ate until they were stuffed. They gathered up the 
leftover scraps and filled up seven baskets with them. 
38|There were four 
thousand men eating there that day—this doesn’t include women and children.

are rituals, customs, and traditions which are not part of what’s commanded for the Jews to do in the 
Bible, in the Law of Moses. They are man-made traditions, not God-made.
*[B]financially support your mother and your father…Lit: Honor your father and mother. The well-known 
commandment. The word honor means not only to honor someone in the sense of the English word, but 
it also means to support someone financially. In this context, the word means financial support.
*[C]designated as an offering to God…The Hebrew korban. What is hinted is that the Pharisees and Scribes 
designated these funds as an offering to God, but, as custodians of those funds, devised clever ways of 
spending it on themselves in the name of God and not actually dropping it in the collection basket.
*[D]defiles…The OT defines a strict delineation between clean and unclean, holy and unholy. These are in 
respect to physical objects, the bodily hygiene, foods, etc. Transgression of one of these regulations 
causes a person to become defiled (unclean). Jesus explains here and in other places a parallel concept 
of clean and unclean in regard to spiritual matters.
*[E]Tyre and Sidon…Tyre and Sidon are gentile regions, outside of Israel, major cities of the Canaanites, the 
first settlers of Israel. They are not spoken of well in the OT. Though the original Canaanites had long 
faded out of the area, they are still referred to as such. Jews were not supposed to have any dealings 
with the Gentiles.
[F]cast it to the dogs…The Jews had a low regard for dogs; Jesus is saying that it wouldn’t be right for him 
to take the blessing (the “Children’s Bread”) which is intended for God’s people and give it to the infidel 
Canaanites. Jesus’s commission from God the Father was to go to His people, the Israelites, not to the 
Gentiles. But this is one of several incidents in the Bible where a person’s faith transcends the privileges 
reserved for God’s people, empowering those who believe to acquire what they would otherwise not be 
entitled to.

Matthew
39|He dismissed the crowd, got into a boat, and went to the Magadan region.


&MATT 16
1|The Pharisees and Sadducees came by. Testing him, they asked him to 
perform a spectacular miracle[a] on the spot. 
2|He delivered an answer to them, “At 
sunset, one says, ‘Ah…good weather—since the sky’s red’; 
3|at sunrise, ‘Ah…dreary 
weather today—since the sky’s red.’ Although you know how to differentiate different 
weather patterns from the same sky color[b], you can’t differentiate the miracles which 
manifest in a given season[A]. 
4|The evil and apostasy in the prevailing Zeitgeist![c] You 
want to see a miracle, do you? No miracle will be performed for you except for Jonah’s 
Miracle”[B]… And he excused himself and departed.
          
5|When they crossed over to the next district, the disciples forgot to take bread 
along with them. 
6|Jesus said to them, “Look out for the Pharisees’ and Sadducees’ 
yeast.” 
7|So among themselves they went over what he said again and again figuring, 
“We didn’t take any bread.” 
8|Jesus, aware of this, said, “What is this that you figured 
out among yourselves, little-faith-ers—that you don’t have any bread?[C] 
9|How is it 
that you still haven’t learned a lesson from nor do you remember the five loaves for the 
five thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up? 
10|Nor the seven loaves 
for the four thousand and how many basketfuls you picked up?[D] 
11|How is it that 
you didn’t get it, when I said to you, ‘Look out for the Pharisees’ and Sadducee’s yeast,’ 
that it wasn’t about bread?” 
12|Then they finally understood that he wasn’t telling 
them to beware of bread yeast but to beware of the Pharisees’ and Sadducees’ teaching.
          
13|Having arrived in the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,
      “Who do people say that the Man[d] is?”
          
14|They replied, “Some, John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah 
or one of the prophets.”
          
15|”Who do you all say that I am?”
          
16|Simon Peter replied, “You are the Messiah[e], the Son of the Living God.”
          
17|Jesus came up with a reply and said to him, “How favored[f] are you, 
‘Full-Throttle’[E] Simon, because this didn’t come to you through human deduction[g], 
but rather it was revealed to you by my heavenly Father. 
18|Now I say to you that 
you are a rock[F], and upon this here rock I will build my Following[h], and all of hell’s 
fury[i] will not defeat it. 
19|And I grant you the backing of the kingdom, the 
authority to act in behalf of the kingdom, and the ability to summon the power of the 
kingdom[j].” 
20|Then he unequivocally ordered them not to tell anyone that he is 
the Messiah.
          
21|Starting then, Jesus began to go about showing his disciples that he must 
travel to Jerusalem in order to suffer greatly at the hands of the national councilmen[k], 
Chief Priests, and designated teachers[l], to be put to death, and to be resurrected on the 
third day. 
22|Peter button-holed him and began to get on his case, “Oh, dear God! 
Lord! No way!” 
23|Jesus snapped back at Peter, “Take a hike, you minion of 
Satan[m]! You’re irritating me because you’re not savvy in the things of God, just in the 
things of man.” 
24|Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wishes to follow in 
my footsteps, let him first disavow himself and pick up his cross, and then let him 
follow me. 
25|The fact is, whoever wants to keep his head, his heart—his very 
being[n]—safe will destroy them, and whoever will destroy his very being on account of 
me will find his way in life[n]. 
26|Just how would a person be benefited if he were 
to gain the whole world but in the process lose his very being? Or what will a person 
give in exchange for his own soul? 
27|For the Man is going to come in the majesty 
and might[o] of his Father accompanied by his angels, and will then dole out to each 
person according to what he did in life[p]. 
*[a]spectacular miracle…Lit: sign
*[b]sky color…Lit: face
*[c]Zeitgeist…Ref. Matt. 3:7
*[d]the Man…Lit: Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[e]the Messiah…Lit: the Christ. Ref. Matt. 2:3
*[f]favored…Lit: blessed. Means favored, but especially favored by God, one who receives good things from 
God. Also means fortunate, lucky.
*[g]human deduction…Lit: flesh and blood didn’t reveal this to you. Ref. Gal. 1:16.
*[h]Following…Lit: church
*[i]hell’s fury…Lit: the gates of hell will not prevail against it. A figure of speech.
*[j]I grant you the backing of the kingdom, the authority to act in behalf of the kingdom, and the ability to 
summon the power of the kingdom…Lit: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and that which 
you would bind upon the earth, it will be having been bound up in heaven. A figure of speech.
*[k]councilmen…Lit: the elders
*[l]designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes
*[m]take a hike, you minion of Satan…Lit: get behind me Satan. Ref. note of Luke 9:23.
*[n]his very being…his way in life…Lit: soul
*[o]majesty and might…Lit: glory
*[p]what he did in life…Lit: his practices

*[A]Can’t differentiate the miracles which manifest in a given season…Lit: miracles of the season. God 
performed different kinds of miracles depending on what was needed at the time. Elijah’s miracles were 
the send-down-fire-from-the-sky type. God performed those kinds of miracles in Elijah’s time (i.e., 
Elijah’s season or Elijah’s dispensation) because that was what was needed or appropriate for that 
season. God was performing through Jesus mostly healing miracles, as the season had changed from 
that of Elijah’s to a season of the mercy of God. The miracles in Jesus’s ministry were of a different 
nature than Elijah’s, but the Pharisees expected Jesus to vindicate himself through Elijah-type miracles. 
The Pharisees were demanding a miracle that was relevant to Elijah’s dispensation and would not 
recognize a miracle which was relevant to Jesus’s dispensation. They could look at the sky, noting the 
time of day and the weather season, and know what kind of weather to expect, but could not 
differentiate what miracle was appropriate for the time they lived in.
*[B]Jonah’s Miracle…This described in Matt. 12:40. Jonah’s Miracle is Jesus coming back from the dead as 
he said he would. Jesus is saying that he won’t do any miracle on-demand except for that singular 
miracle of coming back from the dead. In reality, Jesus did miracles all the time, and the Pharisees could 
have just followed him around and saw one, but the Pharisees wouldn’t accept any of those.
*[C]you don’t have any bread?…Jesus reprimands them because all they’re caught up in thinking about 
where they’re going to find food. That should have faith that God will provide them food and look to the 
kingdom of heaven.
*[D]how many basketfuls you picked up…The account of the leftover baskets here in vv. 9, 10 is repeated 
Mark 9:17. The lesson is the same: in both miracles of multiplication, the disciples finished with the 
same number of baskets as when they started. For that matter, had they fed more, they still would have 
finished with the same number of baskets as they started. The food was not multiplied when Jesus gave 
thanks before the meal. Jesus did not pray and a heap of food appeared. Instead, the miracle occurred 
each time a disciple reached his hand into a basket to hand out more food. The food was multiplied on-
the-spot over and over again, as many times as was needed. The point Jesus makes is that God’s 
provision for our daily bread happens on-the-spot, right when it’s needed, as many times as it’s needed, 
and not provided in a large lump beforehand. Jesus is impressing on them the fact that if they were to 
need more food, it would appear the moment it was needed, and that they shouldn’t worry about it.
*[E]’Full-Throttle’ Simon …Lit: Simon Bariona. Bariona is an Aramaic word (Bar-Jonah) translated Son of 
Jonah. This if a figure of speech that refers to the Prophet Jonah, as Peter’s real father is named John 
(ref. John 1:42). Jonah was full throttle in one direction or full throttle in the other direction, but never 
in-between. So was Peter.
[F]You are a rock…Lit: You are Peter [Gk: petros (Πέτρος /Strong’s 4074)] and upon this here rock [Gk: 
petra (πέτρα /Strong’s 4073)] I will build my church. Peter’s name means rock and Jesus is making a 
word play here by both referring to Peter by his name and by reminding Peter that he is a rock. Some 
disagree as to the interpretation of this verse. Some point to Gk. lectionaries and say that petros is a 
different word than petra, that petros means a rock fragment, that while Peter is the rock fragment, 
Jesus himself is the petra. The other argument says that petros is the Gk. word petra converted into its 
name form. I should point out that this second argument is more plausible, for the reason that the 
attributive adjective construct of the word this in the Gk., namely tautay tay petra or ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ, 
(ταύτῃ /Strong’s 3778), (τῇ /Strong’s 3588), (πέτρᾳ/Strong’s 4073) binds petros to its antecedent petra, 
and therefore they are one in the same. It’s worth pointing out that James supplanted Peter in the 
leadership of the Jewish church in the years following Pentecost.

Matthew

Matthew
28|I’ll tell you one thing—there’re some 
people standing at this spot here who won’t taste the sting of death until they happen to 
see the Man assume his kingly dominion.”


&MATT 17
1|Six days later, Jesus went up a high mountain, bringing along with him 
Peter, James, and his brother John—those four alone. 
2|He was metamorphosed in 
front of them, and his face shined like the sun, and his clothing became as bright as the 
full light of day. 
3|And—like that—Moses and Elijah were seen talking with him. 

4|Peter exclaimed to Jesus, “Lord, it’s a good thing we’re here. If you’d like, I’ll build 
three little holy edifices to house them[a] here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for 
Elijah.” 
5|A cloud appeared abruptly while he was still in the middle of talking, 
engulfing them in its shadow, and just as abruptly a voice spoke from out of the cloud 
saying, “This here is my Beloved Son, in whom I’m quite pleased. Listen to him again 
and again.” 
6|Once the disciples heard the voice, they fell flat on their faces and 
became really scared. 
7|Jesus went to them, touched them, and said, “Rise, and do not 
be afraid.” 
8|When they opened their eyes, they didn’t see anything except for Jesus 
back to normal and by himself again.
          
9|While they were going down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Don’t 
tell anyone about the vision until the Man[b] is raised from the dead.” 
10|The 
disciples asked him, “So now, why do the designated teachers[A] say that Elijah must 
come first, before everything else happens?” 
11|He retorted, “True, Elijah will come 
and set everything right again. 
12|But what I’m telling you is that Elijah has 
already come, and they didn’t acknowledge him as being sent from God, but instead did 
to him the extent of what their evil hearts desired in way of harming him. In the same way, 
the Man will also suffer at their hands.” 
13|It was then that the disciples 
understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
          
14|When he got back to the crowd, a man came up to him kneeling in front 
of him 
15|saying, “Sir, have pity on my son since he’s epileptic and suffers badly. 
You see, one moment he’s having a seizure and the next moment he’s back to normal 
again.[c] 
16|I brought him to your disciples, and they weren’t able to cure him.” 

17|Jesus, in his reaction, answered, “Oh, the disbelief and perversion of this 
Zeitgeist[d]! Just how long do I have to keep holding your hand for[e]? Just how long do I 
have to put up with you? Bring him here.” 
18|Jesus dropped the hammer on him, 
the demon came out of him, and the child was treated that moment. 
19|While they 
were alone, his disciples came over to him and asked, “What’s the reason why we 
couldn’t cast it out on our own?” 
20|Engaging them, he said, “Because of your 
little-faith. I really mean it when I tell you that if you were to have mustard-seed-faith, 
you’d tell the mountain, ‘Pick yourself up from here and go over there,’ and it would go 
over there. Nothing would be impossible for you.” 
21|[B]
          
22|Wrapping it up in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Man is going to be 
taken into custody[f], 
23|they will kill him, and on the third day he’ll rise from the 
dead.” And they became quite sad.
          
24|When he got to Capernaum, the collectors of the annual temple fee paid 
Peter a visit and said, “Your teacher hasn’t paid this year’s temple fee[C] yet.” 

25|Peter took note of the comment and said “Ok” and went into the house. 
Anticipating him, Jesus said to him, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the 
rulers around the world levy fees and taxes? From their cronies[g] or from others?” 

26|Peter answered, “From others.” Jesus then said, “As a result, their cronies are 
exempt. 
*[a]little holy edifices to house them…Lit: little tabernacles [tents]. The word tabernacle refers to the OT 
tabernacle in Mt. Sinai and likewise the temple in Jerusalem. The concept is extended to mean a place 
which is designated as holy.
*[b]the Man…Lit: The Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[c]one moment he’s having a seizure and the next moment he’s back to normal again …Lit: he falls into 
the fire often and into the water often. Presumably an idiom.
*[d]Zeitgeist…Lit: generation. Ref. Matt. 3:7
*[e]Just how long do I have to keep holding your hand for…Lit: until when will I be with you
*[f]taken into custody…Lit: given over into the hands of men
*[g]from their cronies…Lit: from their sons
*[h]a large coin…Lit: a four-drachma coin. This is a $450 value.

*[A]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes. The Scribes were the experts in the OT and used their expertise to 
ascertain the circumstances, sequences, and events that the OT prophecies indicated about the 
Messiah’s coming
*[B]Verse 21 which reads, but this kind only comes out by prayer and fasting, is intentionally omitted 
because it appears to have been added to manuscripts in later centuries and was not part of what 
Matthew originally wrote.
[C]this year’s temple fee…Lit: the two-drachma. This is a silver coin of approx. 9 grams weight silver. See 
conversion note in Matt. 18:28 which translates the purchasing power of a gram of silver in ancient 
times to $25 in a contemporary, industrialized nation. By this reckoning, a two-drachma is valued at 
$225 in contemporary US dollars.

27|But to keep them from getting bent out of shape with us, take a fishing 
rod over to the sea, cast a line out, and reel in the first fish which takes the bait. Open its 
mouth, and in it you’ll find a large coin[h]. Take that over to the collectors and pay your 
and my fees for the year.”


&MATT 18
1|Around that time Jesus’s disciples came to him saying, “So now, who’s the 
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
2|He called a child over and stood him in the 
midst of them 
3|and said, “I’m telling you for real, if you don’t make the change to 
become childlike, you won’t enter the kingdom of heaven. 
4|Therefore whoever will 
abase himself to become like this child, he’s the one who’s the greatest in the kingdom 
of heaven. 
5|And whoever will receive one such child on behalf of me receives me. 

6|Whoever tries to trip up and draw into sin[A] even the most insignificant person who 
believes in me would be better off if he were left sunk in the middle of the ocean with a 
millstone strapped to his neck. 
7|Woe to those who don’t serve God[b], the source of 
such traps[a]. While such traps are certain to come, woe nevertheless to the person 
through whom the trap comes. 
8|So if your hand (i.e., your actions) or your foot (i.e., 
the direction your life is going in; the sequence of things that you do) causes you to do wrong 
or adversely affects you[A], cut it off and throw it away (i.e., quit doing it—period).[B] It’s 
better for you to go through life maimed or crippled than to be thrown into the Eternal 
Fire in possession of both hands and both feet. 
9|And if your eye (i.e., what your 
attention is continuously focused on) causes you to do wrong or adversely affects you, 
yank it out and throw it away (i.e., stop being enthralled by it). It’s better to go through life 
with one eye than to be cast into the fires of hell[c] with both eyes. 
10|See to it that 
you don’t treat even the most insignificant person who believes in me with contempt, 
because, I tell you, their angels in heaven are continuously kept up to date with what 
my heavenly Father is thinking[d].
          
11|[C] 
12|”What do you think about this? If someone had a hundred 
sheep and one of them went astray, wouldn’t he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain 
to themselves and go off looking for the one that’s missing? 
13|Let me tell you, if 
he happens to find it, he’ll be happier about finding it than about the ninety-nine which 
never went astray. 
14|In the same way, isn’t our heavenly Father preoccupied with 
the desire that not even the most insignificant in His flock perish?”
          
15|”Now if your friend[e] were to do you wrong, get with him one-on-one 
and talk through the issue. If he hears you out, you’ve won over your friend. 
16|If 
he won’t listen to what you have to say, next time take two or three others along with 
you, so that ‘Every matter is settled by the mouth of two or three witnesses.’ 
17|If 
he won’t listen to them, let the congregation know. And if he won’t listen to what the 
congregation tells him, treat him the same way you would treat an outsider with whom 
you must have no contact[f] or one of the tax collectors.
          
18|”Know for certain that whatever you prevent here on earth will have 
been prevented in the spiritual world, and whatever you set in motion here on earth 
will have been set in motion in the spiritual world.[g] 
19|Let me put this another 
way: if a couple of you here on earth were to agree concerning any matter which they 
would like to have affected in some way, it will be done for them by my heavenly 
Father, 
20|seeing that when a handful[h] are gathered under my authority in regard 
to a matter, there I am in the midst of them.”
          
21|Then Peter approached him and said, “Lord, how many times must I 
forgive a friend[e] when he does me wrong? Up to seven[D] (i.e., until it’s reached the point 
where enough is enough)?” 
22|Jesus said, “My word to you is not up to seven but up 
to seventy-seven. 
23|For this reason God’s interaction with mankind (the kingdom 
of heaven) is analogous to a king who wanted to settle the account deficiencies of his 
servants. 
24|While chairing the proceedings to settle the deficiencies, one was 
brought to him who owed him like a zillion dollars. 
25|Not having the funds to 
repay him, the king ordered that his wife and children be sold into slavery and that 
everything he owned be confiscated and auctioned off in order to repay him. 

26|The servant got down and groveled in front of him, ‘Give me some more time, 
and I’ll pay everything back.’ 
27|Now the master here of that servant felt sorry for 
him and cancelled the debt that he owed. 
28|So now, that servant went out and 
found one of his fellow co-workers who owed him $10,000[E] and grabbed him and put 
him in a headlock[i] while telling him again and again, ‘You owe me, pay me back!’ 

29|The co-worker got on his knees and begged him, ‘Give me some more time, and 
I’ll pay everything back.’ 
30|But the servant wasn’t willing to, and consequently 
had him thrown in jail, until such a time that he could come up with the money to pay 
him back with. 
31|As a result, the other servants, seeing what had happened, were 
quite disturbed about it all and went and explained what happened to the king. 

32|The then king summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I wiped 
out your debts, since you begged me to. 
33|The right thing for you to do was to 
wipe out all of your fellow worker’s debts, just like I did for you, wasn’t it?’ 
34|The 
king was furious and put him in a stockade[j] until such a time that he paid back 
everything he owed. 
*[a]traps…Lit: stumbling block. The noun form of v. 8 “causes you to do harm.”
*[b]who don’t serve God…Lit: the world
*[c]fires of hell…Lit: the hell of fire. The awkward wording is a figure of speech.
*[d]kept up to date with what my heavenly Father is thinking…Lit: look upon my heavenly Father’s face
*[e]friend…Lit: brother
*[f]an outsider with whom you must have no contact…Lit: a Gentile
*[g]Know for certain that whatever you prevent here on earth will have been prevented in the spiritual 
world, and whatever you set in motion here on earth will have been set in motion in the spiritual 
world…Lit: Truly I say to you all that whatever you bind on earth will be having been bound in heaven, 
and whatever you loose on earth will be having been loosed in heaven.
*[h]a handful…Lit: two or three. A phrase used a few times in the NT to mean a handful (example is 1 Cor. 
14:29).
*[i]put him in a headlock…Lit: started choking him
*[j]put him in a stockade…Lit: handed him over to the torturers

*[A]Tries to trip up and draw into sin…causes you to do wrong or adversely affects you…Lit: puts a 
stumbling block in the way of. The Gk. noun/verb for stumbling block/stumble is skandalon/skandalidzō 
(σκάνδαλον/Strong’s 4625), (σκανδαλίζω/Strong’s 4624), and it’s usage and meaning originated in the 
LXX and from there carried forward into the NT. Skandalon appears in Josh. 23:13; Judg. 2:3; (note Num. 
23:55 is missing from the LXX).
Josh. 23:13, “[these nations] will be a snare and a trap to you”; 
Judg. 2:3, “their gods will be a snare to you.”
These verses refer to two things:
(1) Israel would always be surrounded by hostile nations waiting to attack her the moment the 
opportunity presented itself. Matt. 5:30, 8:30, 18:8, 18:9; Mark 9:43, 9:45, 9:47.
(2) God’s supernatural protection enabled Israel to reign victorious over these nations; when Israel 
disobeyed, however, this protection was removed and these nations defeated Israel in battle, 
encroached on her, and eventually enslaved her.
The LXX meanings of skandalon were adapted into the following NT concepts, summarized as lays a trap 
for; puts an obstacle in the way of; gives offense to; causes one to sin; becomes an occasion of sin for; 
causes one to give up his faith; a point of contention and enumerated as:
(a) A person, a thing, an issue, a doctrine, an action (we’ll call these “thing A”) which hassles, vexes, 
attacks, or irritates a person or some group of people (we’ll call these “party X”). Matt. 13:41.
(b) Thing A setting a trap and lying in wait to ensnare party X. Matt. 18:7, 16:23, 18:6; Luke 17:1, 17:2; 
Rom. 11:9, 16:17; 1 Pet. 2:8.
(c) Party X being affected by a single specific item/thing A; the thing party A is affected by. John 6:61; 
Rom. 14:21; 1 Cor. 1:23, 8:13; Gal. 5:11; Rev. 2:14.
(d) Party X’s irritation which arose from thing A. Matt. 15:12; Mark 9:42

*[B]If your hand or foot causes you to do wrong, cut it off and throw it away (i.e., stop doing it—period)… 
similar wording for the eye. Jesus is not speaking of your physical hands, feet, or eyes here. Throughout 
the Bible, hands symbolize actions, feet symbolize the direction your life is headed in, and eyes 
symbolize the meditation of the mind or the desire of the heart. Jesus is therefore saying if you have a 
habit or some practice which is causing you to sin, quit doing it. If the direction of your life is causing you 
to head into sin, change the direction of your life. If there’s something that you dream about which 
causes you to sin, quit dwelling on it.

brother for a complete set of instances.
[E]$10,000…Lit: 100 denarrii, which is about 14 ounces (0.4Kg) of silver. Converting this to contemporary 
US dollar equivalency is not trivial, nor will all agree on the result, but nevertheless, an attempt is made. 
As it was in ancient times, so it was up until the last century or so, than coins were tethered to their 
intrinsic value in gold or silver. The average biblical commentator did simple conversions based on the 
value of silver. But this does not give meaningful results, as the leaps in industrial productivity have 
made silver relatively plentiful compared to ancient times. The cost of silver in today’s US dollars is 
around $0.76/gram—but that in no way reflects the purchasing power of silver today verses silver in 
ancient times. A more accurate method for conversion is to base it on the cost of unskilled labor. Even 
that varies enormously between industrialized nations and non-industrialized nations. The cost of labor 
in ancient times can be ascertained from Matt. 20:2, which is namely 1 denarius (4g silver) per day. In US 
in the 19th century, a day’s labor went for around $0.80, which was around 18g of silver, or 4.5 times 
more silver per day than what a worker in ancient times received—which demonstrates the inadequacy 
of simple conversions based on the price of gold or silver. But if one assumes that an unskilled worker 
makes $12/hour nowadays in industrialized nations, and therefore is paid $100 per day, then a denarius 
would represent $100 in today’s purchasing power. Of course, in contemporary, non-industrialized 
nations, the price of labor per day might be $5–$10, which is substantially less than industrialized 
nations. So the 100 denarrii equate to $10,000 of purchasing power in industrialized nations, but only 
$500 in non-industrialized nations.

35|This is the same thing that my heavenly Father will do to 
you, if you won’t forgive each of your friends from your hearts.”


&MATT 19
1|When Jesus came to the end of speaking this collection of messages, he 
picked up from Galilee and went to the Judean region, on the other side of the Jordan. 

2|A great crowd followed him, and he healed all that were there.
          
3|In an attempt to test him, some Pharisees approached him saying, “Is there 
any reason for which a husband is allowed to divorce his wife?” 
4|In his response he 
answered, “Haven’t you read that which was established from antiquity, ‘He made 
them man and woman, husband and wife,[A]’ 
5|and, ‘On account of this a man will 
leave father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will result in being 
one flesh’? 
6|So then, they are no longer two individual fleshes but rather one flesh[B]. 
Consequently, let no person separate the thing that God has joined.” 
7|Exchanging 
words, they asked, “Ok, so why does the Old Testament[a] have a commandment which 
says ‘…to furnish a divorce certificate in order to divorce her…’?” 
8|To this exchange, 
he replied, “The Old Testament permitted you to divorce your wives because of your 
hardheartedness[b]; it was not put into being this way from antiquity. 
9|I tell you that, 
except in the case of sexual immorality, whoever divorces his wife and remarries 
commits adultery.” 
10|The disciples, responding to what they heard, said to him, 
“If this is the ask of the person who’s married, you’re better off not getting married.” 

11|He said, “Not everyone is able to keep this set of commandments, but it is only 
for those to whom it has been given, 
12|seeing that some are born single[c], some 
are single because of what other people have done to them, and some made themselves 
single on behalf of the kingdom of heaven. He who has the ability to keep this, let him 
keep it.”
          
13|Then children were brought to him in order for him to lay hands on them 
and to pray for them, but the disciples barked at them and stopped them. 
14|Jesus 
said, “Let the children go and don’t go about preventing them from coming to me, since 
the kingdom of heaven is comprised of such as these.” 
15|He laid his hands on 
them and then left from there.
          
16|Just like that, a young man approached him and said,
      “Teacher, what good must I do in order to have that special fullness of life 
(eternal life)?”
          
17|He said to him, “Why do you ask me about how the ideally good person 
would be? There’s only one who’s ideally good.[C] But if you’re wanting to participate in[d] 
eternal life, keep the commandments.”
          
18|Engaged in the conversation, he said to him, “Which ones?”
      Jesus said, “These ones: ‘Do not murder’…’Do not commit adultery’…’Do not 
steal’…’Do not lie when giving your word’…
19|’Honor your father and 
mother’…’You shall love your neighbor as yourself’.”
          
20|The young man, still engaged, said, “I’ve always been vigilant to do all 
these things[e]. What am I missing still?”
          
21|Jesus declared, “If you want to fill out that missing piece[f], go out and 
sell what you own and give it to the poor, and you’ll have spiritual[g] treasure. Then 
become my follower.”
          
22|After the young man heard this reply, he departed with a sulk, since he 
owned a lot of stuff. 
23|Jesus said to his disciples, “I’m not kidding you when I say 
that it’s really hard for a rich person to participate in the kingdom of heaven. 

24|Let me put it this way—it’s easier for a camel to crouch down and crawl 
through a small gate portal than for God to get involved with a rich man (to enter God’s 
kingdom).”[D] 
25|When the disciples heard this they were simply stunned[h] and 
said, “So now, how can anyone avoid this?[i]” 
26|Jesus looked right at them and 
said to them, “This isn’t possible with people, but with God all things are possible.” 

27|Peter, in his response, answered, “See now, we, for our own part, have left 
everything and have become your followers. What’s going to happen to us?” 

28|Jesus said to them, “Let me say for sure that you—my followers—in the next 
life, when the Man[j] takes a seat on his throne of glory to begin his reign, you yourselves 
will also sit alongside me on twelve thrones of your own and will rule over the entire 
nation of Israel.[E] 
29|And anyone who’s left his home or his brother or sister or 
mother or father or children or livelihood[k] on my account[l] will receive a huge 
amount[m] in return and will legitimately lay claim to and take hold of[F] that special 
fullness of life (eternal life).

from the Septuagint; the words for man and woman here are older Gk. words hardly found in the NT, 
giving the reader the feeling that he’s reading something written long beforehand, like the feeling we 
get when we read the KJV. But the words man and woman have a dual meaning of both man and 
woman and of husband and wife. This verse employs both meanings.
*[B]no longer two individual fleshes but rather one flesh…Lit: they are no longer two but rather one flesh. 
The awkward wording is a figure of speech.
*[C]Why do you ask me about how the ideally good person would be? There’s only one who’s ideally 
good…Lit: He said to him, why do you ask me about the good? One is the good. The substantive the good 
could be a good thing, a good person, or a good being. The context decides which it is. Some early 
manuscripts were modified to have the ending of v. 17 read, One is the good: God.
*[D]it’s easier for a camel to crouch down and crawl through a small gate portal than for God to get 
involved with a rich man…Lit: it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich 
man…Many believe that the eye of a needle refers to a small gate, perhaps a yard (a meter) high, within 
a city wall gate which was used at night to let travelers enter a city without having to open the larger 
gate. A camel could barely fit through this smaller portal if it were to have all its baggage unpacked and 
it were to squeeze down and inch its way through. The analogy is that the camel, in addition to 
scrunching, has to unpack all its goods in order to enter in, just as Jesus asks the young man to give up 
all his belongings in order to enter the kingdom. But regardless of whether one receives this argument 
or not, a point to be made is that God is not opposed to the wealthy per se, but when the wealthy are 
made to choose between their earthly riches and the kingdom of God, it is only with great difficulty that 
they will part with their goods and choose the kingdom. God is not the one who prevents them from 
entering his kingdom; their own choice prevents them. Also, ref. Luke 18:25.
*[E]Let me say for sure that you—my followers—in the next life, when the Man takes a seat on his throne 
of glory to begin his reign, you yourselves will also sit alongside me on twelve thrones of your own and 
will rule over the entire nation of Israel…Lit: Truly I say to you that you, my followers, in the re-birth, 
when the Son of Man sits upon a throne of his glory, you yourselves will also sit with me upon twelve 
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. In the OT, judges were ad-hoc rulers appointed by God over 
Israel; hence the word judging. Also, at the time Jesus spoke this, several of the twelve tribes of Israel 
had already been erased from existence. The twelve tribes of Israel here abstractly refer of all Israelites 
everywhere, and would include those scattered throughout the Roman Empire (see James 1:1).

30|And many who are first will be last and last first.”


&MATT 20
1|”The kingdom of heaven is analogous to a man who was the foreman for a 
vineyard, who went out at the first light of day to hire some day-workers to work the 
vineyard. 
2|After some workers agreed to a wage of $100[a] for the day, he sent them 
over to the vineyard. 
3|He ventured out around nine in the morning[b] and saw some 
guys hanging out in the town square. 
4|He said to those others, ‘You too go over to 
the vineyard, and I’ll pay you something reasonable.’ 
5|So they went. Again, he 
ventured out at noon and again at three and did the same thing. 
6|In the late 
afternoon, around five or six, he ran across others who were just hanging out and 
started a conversation, ‘Why have you been standing around all day here in the town 
square?’ 
7|Taking the remark in, they said, ‘Because nobody hired us.’ Continuing the 
conversation, he said, ‘You too go on over to my vineyard.’
          
8|”When sundown approached, the vineyard owner told the foreman, ‘Call the 
workers in and pay them their wages, starting with the ones who went out last and 
ending with the first.’ 
9|The ones who started in the late afternoon came and received 
$100. 
10|When the first workers came they thought they’d be paid more, but even 
they received the sum of $100. 
11|When they received their pay, they started to 
belly-ache and complain to the foreman,
          
12|”’These guys, the last workers, did just one hour of work, and yet they 
get the same as us, who bore the brunt of the day’s work and that in the scorching 
heat?’
          
13|”He replied to one of them, ‘Hey, buddy, I haven’t cheated you. Didn’t 
you agree to $100? 
14|Take what’s coming to you and be on your way. If I want to 
pay this last guy here the same as you—
15|Don’t I get to do whatever I want, as I 
see fit? Or is your bad attitude[c] because of my generosity[d]’
          
16|It’ll be the same way: the first will be last and the last first.”
          
17|Jesus took the twelve disciples, and they went by themselves up to 
Jerusalem. Along the way, he told them, 
18|”Look here, we’re going to Jerusalem, 
and the Man[e] will be taken into custody by the chief priests and designated teachers[f], 
and they’ll sentence him to death. 
19|They’ll hand him over to the Romans[g] in 
order to be ridiculed, flogged, and crucified. And on the third day, he’ll be resurrected.”
          
20|Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came with her sons to bow down 
and ask something from him.
          
21|He said, “What do you want?”
      Taking advantage of the moment, she said, “Appoint these two sons of mine to 
be your right-hand men in your kingdom.[h]”
          
22|For his response Jesus replied, “You don’t know what you’re asking for. 
Will you all be able to make it through what I’m going to have to go through?[i]”
      Fully aware, they said, “We are able.”
          
23|He, matching their awareness, said, “To go through, on the one hand, 
what I have to go through or to be appointed, on the other hand, as my right-hand men 
is not up to me to decide,[j] but it is reserved for those for whom my Father has 
prepared.”
          
24|When the other ten heard of this, they became furious with the brothers. 

25|Jesus summoned them together and said, “As you well know, the rulers of the 
nations everywhere subjugate those under them, and their especially-powerful ones 
hold total authority over them. 
26|It won’t be this way with you all, but instead 
whoever wishes to be especially-powerful among you, let him become your servant, 

27|and whoever wishes to be first among you your slave—
28|just as the Man 
didn’t come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a redemption payment for 
the many.”
          
29|A large crowd followed him as he left Jericho. 
30|Suddenly two 
blind men sitting alongside the road heard that Jesus was passing by, and shouted out,
      “Have mercy on us, sir, you godsend[k]!”
          
31|But the crowd yelled at them to keep quiet. But all the more louder they 
shouted out,
      “Have mercy on us, sir, you godsend!!”
          
32|Jesus halted, called for them, and said, “What do you want me to do for 
you?”
          
33|They said to him, “Sir, that we would be able to see.”

away they gained their sight and became his followers.


&MATT 21
1|When he drew near to Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage, at the Mount of 
Olives, at that time Jesus sent out two disciples, 
2|telling them, “Go into the town 
across the way from us, and right away you’ll find a donkey tied down with a foal next to 
it. Untie them and lead them to me. 
3|And if anyone asks what you’re doing, say that 
the Lord is in need.” 
4|This happened so that the Prophet Isaiah’s prophecy would be 
fulfilled, which says:


5|Say to the socialites
In the God-intended city of Jerusalem[A]:
“Look!—your king is coming your way,
Self-restrained and soft-spoken[a] and mounted on a donkey
And upon a pack animal’s foal”[B]

          
6|The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do. 
7|They lead away 
the donkey and the foal and placed their outer garments on them, and he sat on them. 

8|Most of the crowd spread their outer garments out on the road before him, while 
others chopped off tree branches and spread them out on the road. 
9|And the crowd 
of forerunners and the crowd of tail-runners kept shouting,

Rescue us[b] by the godsend![c]
Praise be to him who comes at the Lord’s behest[d]
Rescue us to the max!

          
10|Having entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up saying, “Who is 
this guy?” 
11|The crowd kept saying, “This here is the Prophet Jesus from 
Nazareth, Galilee.”
          
12|Jesus entered the temple and threw out all the salesmen and the 
merchandisers in there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and those 
selling doves.[C] 
13|He told them, “It’s written in the Scriptures, ‘My house shall be 
called a house of prayer’, but you’ve made it into a robber’s hideout.”
          
14|In the temple the blind and lame came to him, and he healed them. 

15|The chief priests and the designated teachers[e], seeing the wonders that he did 
and seeing the children going around shouting “Rescue us by the godsend!”, became 
indignant. 
16|They said to him, “Do you hear what they’re saying?” Jesus, in step 
with the conversation, replied, “Yes. Haven’t you ever read the verse, ‘I have queued 
exaltation to come from the mouth of youths and infants’.” 
17|Excusing himself 
from them, he exited the city, went to Bethany, and spent the night there.
          
18|While returning to the city at dawn, he became hungry. 
19|Seeing a 
fig tree alongside the road, he went over to it and found that it had nothing within it 
except for leaves only, and, addressing it, said to it, “You’ll never again bear fruit—
ever.” And right away the tree shriveled up. 
20|Seeing it, the disciples were 
amazed and were saying how the fig tree had shriveled up right away. 
21|Reacting 
to this, Jesus replied, “I’m telling you the truth: if you were to have faith and not doubt, 
not only would you do such as what was done with the fig tree, but you’d even say to a 
mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea’, and it would come to pass. 

22|And that for which you were to ask for in prayer, while believing you will 
receive.”
          
23|Having come to the temple, the chief priests and the councilmen[D] 
approached him while he was teaching saying, “By what authority do you do these 
things? And who gave you this authority?” 
24|Jesus in his comeback answered, 
“Concerning who gave me this authority: I’ll answer your question if you’ll answer 
mine. 
25|Where did John’s baptism come from, from heaven or from mankind?” 
They were debating the matter amongst themselves saying, “If we say ‘from heaven’, 
then he’ll say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe in him?’. 
26|But if we say, ‘from 
mankind’, we’ll have good reason to be afraid of the crowd since they consider John to be 
a prophet.” 
27|They put forth their reply and answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” 
And so his answer to them was, “Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these 
things.”
          
28|”Now, just what do you all think of this? A man has two sons. He goes to 
the first[e] son and says, ‘Go out and work the vineyard today’. 
29|The son answers, 
‘I don’t want to’, but later on has a change of heart and goes on out to the vineyard. 

30|He goes to the second son and says the same thing to him. He replies ‘Yes sir!’[E] 
but never goes out. 
31|Which one of the two did what his father wanted?” They 
said, “The first[f].” Jesus said to them, “I’m telling you—as far as getting God involved 
in your life (getting into God’s kingdom), the tax collectors and prostitutes will beat you 
there. 
32|You see, John, who was all about right and wrong[g], came to you and you 
didn’t believe in him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him. While you 
were seeing all this yourselves, you didn’t have a change of heart later on so as to 
believe in him.”
          
33|”Listen to another analogy. An estate owner[h] planted a vineyard, put a 
fence around it, dug a winepress, and built a watchtower for it.[F] He leased it out to 
some gardeners and left for a long journey. 
34|When the harvest came in, he sent 
his servants to the gardeners to receive his produce. 
35|The farmers took his 
servants and beat up one of them, killed another one of them, and had the third one 
ceremonially executed[i]. 
36|Yet again he sent other servants, more of them this 
time, and they treated them the same way. 
37|Last of all he sent them his son 
saying, ‘They’ll respect my son’. 
38|The gardeners, seeing that he sent his son, said 
to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come on—let’s go kill him so that we’ll get his claim to 
the land’. 
39|They took him and drove him some place outside of the vineyard and 
killed him there. 
40|So now, when the vineyard owner comes, what do you think 
he’s going to do to those gardeners?” 
41|They told him, “He’s going to cruelly 
annihilate those wicked men and lease the vineyard out to other farmers, ones who, 
when harvest time comes, will give him his produce.” 
42|Jesus said to them, “You 
never read the Scripture,

“The stone which the masons inspected and rejected:
This became the main cornerstone.
By the Lord’s doing it came to pass,
And is something our eyes are in awe over.

          
43|”This is the reason I’m telling you that God’s involvement with you 
(God’s kingdom) will be taken away from you and will be given to foreigners and to 
outsiders from other nations, to those who will live up to the kingdom’s expectations[j]. 

44|And he who falls on this stone (meaning he who disobeys it) will crumble[k], and he 
on whom it falls (meaning he whom God strikes in judgment) will be pulverized.[G]”

*[j]live up to the kingdom’s expectations…Lit: produce its fruit
*[k]crumble…Lit: be smashed into pieces

*[A]the socialites in the God-intended city of Jerusalem…Lit: the daughters in Zion. The daughters in Zion is 
a figure of speech which refers figuratively to the socialites in Jerusalem and the surrounding area , the 
ones who keep up on all the comings and goings, the ones who are apt to spread news. Zion is an 
alternate name used in the OT for Jerusalem, but Zion refers to the way that God intended Jerusalem to 
be, which is not what it degenerated into.
*[B]mounted on a donkey a pack animal’s foal…Lit: mounted on a donkey and upon a foal of a beast of 
burden. This is a figure of speech used in the OT where a fact is given as a statement and then repeated 
immediately after for effect in a second statement. Usually the repeated statement elaborates with 
detail omitted from the first statement and, if having to choose between the two, is the more accurate.
*[C]money changers and those selling doves…People regularly made the journey, some from great 
distances, to the Jerusalem temple to offer sacrifices there, doves in this case. Instead of carrying the 
sacrificial animal a great distance, it was more convenient to buy such animal on the spot. To do so they 
had to exchange their foreign currency for domestic. According to Moses’s law, they were supposed to 
offer up the best of their herds, etc. to God, which implied that they take such on the trip to Jerusalem.
*[D]the councilmen…Lit: the elders of the people. Moses instituted a system where select representatives 
of the people formed a committee of elders which arbitrated disputes and settled legal cases for the 
nation.
*[E]Yes, Sir!…Lit: I, Lord!, which is short for, Here I am, Lord! The GT expresses something like the German 
Jawohl! (pronounced ya-VOWL), which one hears in old war movies when the underling at once 
straightens up, clicks the heels of his boots together, and receives the order with a firm response of 
“Jawohl!”
*[F]built a watchtower for it…In ancient Israel, vineyards had walls that had briars planted over them to 
keep out foxes and other critters—even thieves. The watchtower was a two-story lookout to spot foxes, 
and was also used as a storage cellar for the grapes and used as a temporary shelter for the workers. 
Without the fence, the winepress, and the watchtower, the vineyard’s yield would be too low for it to be 
profitable. Furthermore, it was common practice for an owner to lease out a vineyard to workers who 
would take a percentage of the harvest as payment.
This tale of the vineyard comes from Isaiah chapter 5. Jesus starts quoting from Isaiah 5, but as the 
parable progresses, he deviates from the tale and creates his own ending. 
[G]he who falls on this stone (meaning he who disobeys it) will crumble, and he on whom it falls (meaning 
he whom God strikes in judgment) will be pulverized …The fate of two types of unbelievers is described 
here. The first is the one who falls on the stone. Like other places in the NT, one who falls on a stone is a 
person who stumbles over a stumbling block. This person willfully and sinfully decides not to obey the 
Lord. The second type is the one on whom the stone falls upon. This person is one who is punished in a 
judgment from the Lord. This judgment is imposed on him.

Matthew

46|Though they were trying to get their hands on 
him, they were afraid of the crowd, since they considered him to be a prophet.


&MATT 22
1|As he had been thinking things over for a while, Jesus again spoke to them 
by way of analogy. He said, 
2|”God’s interaction with mankind (the kingdom of 
heaven) is analogous to a king who threw a wedding for his son. 
3|He dispatched his 
servants to summon the invitees to the wedding, and they weren’t willing to come. 

4|Again, he sent out his servants saying, ‘Tell the invitees: look—the banquet’s been 
prepared, my bulls and my fatted calves have been slaughtered, and everything’s 
ready. Come to the wedding events.’ 
5|Of those who blew it off and left, there was the 
one who had farm chores to do, while there was the other who had business affairs to 
attend to. 
6|The rest grabbed his servants, assaulted them, and killed them. 
7|The 
king was furious and sent his soldiers out to annihilate those murderers and to burn 
their city to the ground. 
8|Then he told his servants, ‘While the wedding festivities are 
ready to start, the invitees didn’t qualify[a]. 
9|So now, go out to the on-ramps and the 
off-ramps and invite whoever you find to the wedding.’ 
10|Those servants went to 
the highways and gathered anyone they could find, bad folk in addition to good. The 
wedding hall was packed with people seated[b] for a feast. 
11|The king entered to 
look over those seated and saw a person there who wasn’t dressed properly for the 
occasion. 
12|Taking note, he said to him, ‘Hey, pal, how’d you get in here, not 
dressed for a wedding[A]?’ He was speechless. 
13|Then the king said to his 
attendants, ‘Tie him up, hands and feet, and throw him into the Outer Darkness. That’s 
the place where there’ll be weeping and gnashing of teeth[c].’ 
14|There are many 
invited indeed, but few of them are selected.”[B]
          
15|The Pharisees then met together to come up with a plan to find a way to 
trip him up in one of his statements. 
16|They sent him their disciples along with 
the Herodians saying,
      “Teacher, we know that you’re honest and that what you teach is the true way to 
God and that you could care less what anyone thinks about you[d]; the fact is, you don’t 
key off other people’s attitudes[e]. 
17|Tell us, now, what do you think? Do we have 
to pay Caesar the poll tax or not?”
          
18|Knowing how evil they were, Jesus said, “Hypocrites—why are you 
trying to trip[f] me up? 
19|Show me the coin that’s used to pay the tax with.”
      They brought him a denarius.
          
20|On top of the situation, he said, “Whose picture do you see etched in 
here?”
          
21|They, keeping up with the conversation, said to him, “Caesar’s.”
      Then not missing a beat, he said, “So then, give Caesar’s things to Caesar, and 
God’s things to God.”
          
22|After they heard that, they were stunned and departed, leaving him 
there.
          
23|Around that time[g], the Sadducees, who state that there is no life after 
death[h], asked him, 
24|“Teacher, the Old Testament Law[i] says, ‘If someone who 
has no children were to die, his brother will marry his wife and raise offspring for his 
brother.’ 
25|Now there were[j] seven brothers, and the first was married and died, 
not having any offspring, his wife was left to his brother. 
26|The same happened to 
the second brother, then to the third, and so on, up to the seventh. 
27|Last of all, 
the woman died. 
28|Therefore, in the next life, to which of the seven brothers will 
this woman be married to, since all of the brothers had married her?” 
29|Jesus 
answered them, “You get off-base not knowing the Scriptures nor knowing God’s 
ability. 
30|The fact is, in the next life, there is no marriage, but instead people exist 
in heaven like angels. 
31|But concerning life after death, haven’t you read the 
statement by God which says, 
32|’I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac 
and the God of Jacob.’ God isn’t the God of the dead but of the living.” 
33|The 
crowd heard this and was amazed at his explanation.
          
34|Now after the Pharisees heard that he’d left the Sadducees speechless, 
they met together for the same reason. 
35|Testing him, one of their experts in Old 
Testament commandments asked him, 
36|”Teacher, which of the Old Testament 
commandments is the greatest?” 
37|He said, “’You shall love the Lord your God 
with your entire heart and with your entire being[k]’. 
38|This is the greatest and 
foremost commandment. 
39|The second is similar, ‘You shall love your neighbor 
as yourself.’ 
40|The entire Old Testament is summarized by these two.”
          
41|While the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them, 
42|”What do 
you think about the Messiah[l]? Whose descendent is he?” Following along with the 
conversation, they said, “David’s.” 
43|Also following along, he said, “So now, how 
is it that David by the Spirit calls him Lord saying,


44|”An all-powerful Lord said to my lord,
Be my right-hand man[m]
Until I decide to subdue your enemies and subjugate them to you[n]


45|”So now, if David calls him Lord, how is he a descendent of his?” 
*[a]didn’t qualify…Lit: weren’t worthy
*[b]seated…Lit: reclining. Ref. note in Matt. 14:19.
*[c]weeping and gnashing of teeth…Ref. note in Matt. 8:12
*[d]you could care less what anyone thinks of you…Or: you don’t intend to do anything as far as anyone’s 
concerned
*[e]don’t key off other people’s attitudes…Lit: you don’t see unto the face of men
*[f]trip me up…Lit: test
*[g]around that time…Lit: in those days
*[h]life after death…Lit: resurrection
*[i]Old Testament Law…Lit: Moses

*[k]your entire being…Ref. note in Matt. 10:28
*[l]the Messiah…Lit: the Christ
*[m]be my right-hand man…Lit: sit to my right or sit at my right hand. In other words, assume the position 
and authority as my chief executive, the highest under me
*[n]Until I decide to subdue your enemies and subjugate them to you…Lit: Until I place your enemies under 
your feet. An idiom used throughout the Bible.

*[A]not dressed for a wedding…Throughout the Bible, clothes are symbolic of righteousness, one’s 
standing before God. One who is clothed properly has right standing before God. This is what Jesus is 
referring to here. There is a righteousness that man attempts on his own and a righteousness which God 
provides. Man’s righteousness is his own clothing, and, in this parable, his own clothing is not the proper 
attire for a wedding. The only attire which is proper for a wedding is that which God provides, His 
wedding outfit. The bad folk in v.10 who were invited were given the proper clothing to wear, meaning 
that they received a righteousness given by God, and therefore were not thrown out of the wedding.
[B]There are many invited indeed, but few of them are selected…Lit: many are the called, few are the 
chosen. From the repetition of words in this passage, it’s clear that Jesus in this verse is referring to the 
ones who have been invited to the wedding. In other words, the the called in v.14 here specifically refers 
to those invited in v.3. The chosen refers to those who in v.8 qualify (are worthy). Jesus is saying that 
many are invited to the wedding but only a few show up and are dressed properly when they do. In that 
light, God is not arbitrarily choosing a few out of the many, but lays down simple, easy requirements 
that only a few will comply with.

about anything.


&MATT 23
1|Then Jesus had a talk with the crowd and his disciples, 
2|“The Scribes—the 
designated teachers—and the Pharisees have been appointed to the position of Old 
Testament Law instructor[a]. 
3|Therefore, observe and put into action everything they 
tell you to, but don’t imitate what they practice, since they’re talkers and not doers. 

4|They bundle heavy loads together—too heavy—and they set them on people’s 
shoulders,[A] but they themselves aren’t willing to budge a finger to take up the same. 

5|Everything they do, they do to be seen by people—like they make their 
phylacteries[B] wider and their tassels longer. 
6|They love to sit at the head of the table 
at dinner engagements, to be seated front and center in the synagogues, 
7|to be 
greeted in the marketplaces, to have people call them ‘Rabbi’. 
8|You all are not to be 
called ‘Rabbi’; for there is one who is your Rabbi—your honest-to-goodness teacher—and 
you all are brothers. 
9|You are not to call anyone on this planet ‘Father’; for we have 
one Father, the one in heaven. 
10|You are not to be called ‘Leader’; for we have one 
leader—the Christ. 
11|The greatest among you will be your servant. 

12|Whoever seeks to exalt himself, let him abase himself; whoever abases himself 
will be exalted.”
          
13|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—You close down the 
entrance to God’s involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven), leaving people 
standing there right outside of it;[b] indeed, you yourselves aren’t entering, nor will you 
let those who are in the middle of entering it enter it. 
14|[c]
          
15|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—because you follow the 
entire coastline around the ocean and go round about on dry ground to convert one 
person, and when he becomes a convert, you turn him into twice as much the son of 
hell as yourselves.
          
16|”Woe to you, guides to the blind, who say, ‘If someone were to swear an 
oath by the temple, the oath doesn’t count[d]. But if someone were to swear an oath by 
the gold in the temple, he has to keep it.’ 
17|Stupid and blind guides—which is 
more important[e], the gold or the temple which sanctified the gold? 
18|And, ‘If 
someone were to swear an oath by the altar, the oath doesn’t count. But if someone 
were to swear an oath by the offering on the altar, he has to keep it.’ 
19|Blind 
guides—which is more important, the offering or the altar that sanctified the offering? 

20|So then, don’t swear an oath by the altar nor by anything that’s upon it. 

21|Whoever swears an oath by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells 
in it, 
22|and whoever swears an oath by heaven swears by the throne of God and 
by He who sits upon it.
          
23|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—because you a pay an 
offering of ten percent on mint, dill, and cumin and forsake the more significant aspects 
of the Law—judgment, mercy, and faith. You were supposed to put these things into 
practice and not forsake those other things. 
24|Guides to the blind—you filter out a 
gnat but swallow a camel.
          
25|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—because you clean the 
outside of the cup and plate, but on the inside you’re full of thievery and a lack of self-
control[f]. 
26|You blind Pharisee, in order for the outside of the cup to become 
clean, you must clean the inside of the cup first.
          
27|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—because you’re like 
white-washed tombs[g],[C] which appear beautiful from the outside but on the inside are 
full of the bones of the dead and of all sorts of things which are unholy and are 
forbidden to touch[h]. 
28|You appear to people this way as well: On the outside 
you’re righteous, but on the inside you’re full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
          
29|”Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! Hypocrites!—because you build 
tombs for the prophets and decorate the memorials of the righteous, 
30|and say, 
‘Had we been alive back in our ancestor’s time, we wouldn’t have gone along with the 
shedding of the prophets’ blood.’ 
31|In this way you testify against yourselves, 
because you follow in the footsteps[i] of those who murdered the prophets. 

32|You’re every bit as bad as your ancestors.[j] 
33|Snakes! Collection of vipers 
who are inbred in your thinking![k] How can you avoid being sentenced to hell?[l] 

34|On account of this—pay attention to this—I will send you prophets, wise men, 
and scholars and teachers[m]. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them 
you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, 
35|which will 
result in you taking the blame[n] for all the blood of the righteous being pouring out on 
the earth, from Abel of the righteous line to the blood of Zacharias son of Berekiah, who 
was murdered in between the temple and the altar. 
36|Yes indeed, I tell you, all 
these things will be credited to this generation[o].
          
37|”Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent to 
her, how often I wanted to gather your citizens[p] to me, just like a hen gathers her

*[A]They bundle heavy loads together—too heavy—and they set them on people’s shoulders…In this 
metaphor, Jesus compares the commandments which the Scribes and Pharisees give to placing a yoke 
on an ox for the ox to pull a heavy load.
*[B]phylacteries…These are small boxes containing small scrolls which are tied to the arm and the 
forehead. These are used as a literal application of verses such as Deut. 6:8, for one. Tassels are 
mentioned in verses such as Num. 15:38–39 and Deut. 22:12. Jesus, in fact, wore tassels himself.
[C]white-washed tombs…Touching the body of a dead person is an act of uncleanness to the Jews. 
Therefore, their sepulchers (tombs) were painted white to warn of the uncleanness on the inside.

&MATT 24
1|Having exited the temple, Jesus was going about his way, and his disciples 
went over to him to point out what a monumental achievement it was to build the 
temple. 
2|Jesus responded to them by saying, “See all these things here? I’m telling 
you the truth—not a single stone will be left here on top of another stone which will not 
have been torn down.”
          
3|When he took a seat on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came alone and 
said, “Tell us when these things will take place and what will be the sign of your 
appearance at the finale of the ages?” 
4|Jesus replied, “Make sure that no one deceives 
you, 
5|since many will come claiming to have my authority[a] saying ‘I’m the Messiah’, 
and many will be deceived. 
6|You’ll hear about there being wars and you’ll hear news 
of wars that are imminent. Don’t be alarmed; these things must happen. But the end is 
yet to come. 
7|Nations and nationalities will rise against nations and nationalities 
indeed, and kingdoms against kingdoms. There’ll be famines and earthquakes from 
place to place. 
8|All of these—the first labor pains. 
9|Then they’ll subject you to 
oppression[b] and will kill you, and you’ll be hated by people throughout the world on 
account of you doing what I told you to do[c]. 
10|During that time many will 
become offended and fall into sin; they will betray one another and hate one another. 

11|Many evil impersonators of prophets will come on the scene and lead many 
astray. 
12|Because the amount of lawlessness will have increased many times over, 
the unselfish-love of many a person will chill down. 
13|He who has the 
perseverance to endure until it’s all over—this is the person who’ll survive[d] 

14|This here message of the kingdom’s good news[e] will be proclaimed to the 
entire inhabited world for a courtroom-like testimony[A] to all the nations and 
nationalities, and then the end will come.”
          
15|”When you see the ‘abomination causing things to fall into oblivion[f]’—
the Prophet Daniel’s prophecy—standing in the holy place (have the one who reads this 
out loud to the congregation think this through ahead of time)[B], 
16|then have those in 
Judea flee to the mountains. 
17|Don’t have whoever’s on the porch go in and get 
anything out of the house,[C] 
18|and don’t have whoever’s out in the field go back 
to the house and grab his coat. 
19|Oh, how horrible[g] it’ll be for women at that time 
who are pregnant or have infants[D]! 
20|Hope to God[h] that you don’t have to flee 
in the wintertime or on a day that you’re not allowed to work[E].
          
21|Indeed, there will be a tremendous amount of suffering,[i] such which 
hasn’t occurred from the beginning of time until then, nor will occur any time 
afterwards. 
22|And if it weren’t for those days having been cut short, then not a 
single living being[j] would survive; but those days will be cut short on account of the 
Chosen Ones. 
23|At that time, if someone says to you, ‘Look here—the Messiah’ or 
‘Here he is’, don’t believe him, 
24|since false Messiahs will come to the forefront 
and produce great signs and wonders (i.e., portents and spectacular miracles) in order to 
deceive people, and if possible, even deceive the Chosen Ones. 
25|There now—I’ve 
told you this ahead of time. 
26|Consequently, if anyone says to you, ‘Look—here 
he is out in the countryside’, don’t go out there; ‘Look—he’s in his bedroom’, don’t 
believe it.[F] 
27|For you see, a flash of lighting originates in the east and appears 
across the sky all the way to the west; the appearance of the Man[k] will be the same way. 

28|Wherever the carcass is, the vultures will aggregate.

          
29|”Right after the suffering of those days,

The sun will go dark
And the moon won’t shine
The stars will fall from the sky
The wonder and might of the sky into heaven will be shaken


30|”Then the Man’s sign will appear in the sky, and then all the nationalities[l] in 
the world will be deeply sorry[m] as they see the Man coming upon the clouds in the 
sky’[n]. 
31|And he will send his angels with huge trumpets and they will gather his 
Chosen Ones from every corner of the earth, from one side of the planet to the other[o].
          
32|”Learn from the fig tree analogy: when its branches become tender and 
its leaves bud, know that summer is right around the corner. 
33|In the same way, 
when we see all these things, know that he’ll[p] soon come knocking at the door. 

34|I’m telling you for sure—that very generation won’t go away until all these 
things happen. 
35|The sky and the earth will fade away, but these words of mine 
will certainly not go away.
          
36|”But concerning that day and hour, nobody knows, neither the angels in 
heaven nor the Son, but the Father alone. 
37|The fact is, the Man’s appearance will 
be like it was in Noah’s time; 
38|you see, in those days, before the flood, they were 
eating and drinking and getting married, up until the day that Noah entered the ark. 

39|They were oblivious until the flood hit and took them all away; the appearance 
of the Man will be the same way. 
40|When that time comes, two men will be in the 
field; one gets taken away and one’s left behind. 
41|Two women will be grinding at 
the mill; one gets taken away and one’s left behind. 
42|Consequently, stay focused, 
since you don’t know what day our Lord will appear. 
43|I’m sure you know[q], that 
had the homeowner known which part of the night the thief would come, he would’ve 
been on the lookout—and with vigilance—and would’ve stopped him from breaking in. 

44|For this reason, you too be prepared, because you can’t presume to know what 
hour the Man comes.
          
45|”So now, just who could be[r] that faithful—and sensible—servant which 
the estate owner could put in charge of his estate, to keep the well-oiled machine

46|That servant is praise-worthy, whom the estate owner finds 
running things in an orderly fashion. 
47|I tell you for sure, that he’ll appoint him 
caretaker over all of his properties. 
48|But if that awful servant he has says in his

in Luke 11:17
*[g]Oh, how horrible…Lit: woe to. Used as a figure of speech in this context
*[h]Hope to God…Lit: pray that…A figure of speech; Jesus isn’t actually telling them to pray
*[i]tremendous amount of suffering…Lit: great affliction
*[j]not a single living being…Lit: all flesh. A figure of speech.
*[k]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20
*[l]nationalities…Lit: tribes of the earth
*[m]will be deeply sorry…Lit: will mourn
*[n]the Man coming upon the clouds in the sky…Quoted from Dan. 7:13
*[o]gather his Chosen Ones from every corner of the earth, from one side of the planet to the other…Lit: 
…gather his Chosen from out of the four winds from extreme ends of the sky to extreme ends of the sky. 
A figure of speech.
*[p]he’ll…Or: it’ll
*[q]I’m sure you know…Lit: That you know
*[r]So now, just who could be……which the estate owner puts in charge…Lit: So now, who is that…which 
the estate owner puts in charge. A figure of speech.
*[s]well-oiled machine humming along…Lit: to prepare timely meals for everyone
*[t]stoops to partying…Lit: eats and drinks with the drunkards
*[u]from then on he’ll be treated the same as…Lit: his portion will be with the
*[v]weeping and gnashing of teeth…Ref. note in Matt. 8:12.

*[A]testimony…Verse 14 says that the proclamation of the gospel at the time will be like a person 
testifying in the old Jewish court of law, where guilt or innocence was determined by testimonies given, 
and not by a judge or a jury. The evidence will be laid out undeniably for all people in the world, whose 
only just verdict—based on the evidence presented—is to believe that Jesus is the Christ.
*[B]have the one who reads this out loud to the congregation think this through ahead of time…This is a 
parenthetical note to the reader (referred to here as the “deacon”). The deacon reads scrolls out loud to 
the congregation during church services; those in the congregation did not read scrolls themselves, even 
at home. Matthew’s note here is given to the deacon, with the intention that the deacon read this note 
to himself ahead of time before the Scripture reading in front of the congregation, and do some 
research on what the abomination of desolation is, to refresh himself on Daniel’s prophecies, and 
complete this research before the reading. Then the deacon, when he reached this verse while reading 
to the congregation, would pause reading the scroll and explain to the congregation in his own words 
the details of Daniel’s prophecy, then continue.
*[C]on the porch go in and get anything out of the house…Lit: let not he upon the roof go down to remove 
things out of his house. Ancient Israeli houses used their roofs as porches. What Jesus is saying is to take 
the quick way down off the roof of the house, which is the ladder on the outside of the house, rather 
than the slower way down, which is the stairs or ladders on the inside of the house, and while going 
through the house pick up some belongings. This is a figure of speech, akin to a hyperbole. In reality, 
those warned to flee would have two minutes or so—but only two minutes—to gather some belongings 
for the road, get the kids, unhitch the donkey, and get out of there. This is the point Jesus is making.
*[D]for women at that time who are pregnant or have infants…It’ll be difficult for a pregnant woman to 
flee quickly and thereafter travel at a fast pace, since, obviously, pregnant women can’t march easily. 
Women with infants (breastfeeding women) will have difficulty because there’ll be a limited amount of 
food to eat compounded by the calories burned while travelling at a fast clip. Such women won’t be able 
to produce as much milk in these conditions. Furthermore, children who are still breastfeeding likely are 
still in diapers, and infants are more difficult to carry around on a backpack too, or the like. But it seems 
that Jesus is using examples of women in a figure of speech, to represent anyone who would have 
difficulty fleeing…the elderly, the bedridden, the lame, etc.
*[E]day that you’re not allowed to work…Lit: the Sabbath, which consists of not only Saturdays but a 
myriad of Jewish holidays. Also, bear in mind that the Israeli growing season is in the winter, not in the 
summer. This begs the question, just why would flight in either the winter time or on Sabbaths and 
holidays be difficult? The likely answer is that during both of these times, there’s no previously stored 
food available which can be taken in a hurry for the trip to the mountains. While one must store away 
food in the off season to eat, when the crops are growing, you’ve already eaten through your cache. 
Likewise, with the Sabbaths the Jews did all their preparations for the Sabbath on the day before, and 
didn’t have any bread baked, etc. on the Sabbath day itself, so a there’d be no fresh bread available for 
the road.
[F]countryside…bedroom…Ref 3:1 wilderness…closet. This word closet is the same word Jesus used in 6:6, 
where he told us to go into a closet and pray in secret. It’s no coincidence that these places are repeated 
in v.26; the countryside, where John the Baptist was, is a place of self-denial, of fasting, of repentance. 
The bedroom (closet) is a place of prayer. Both of these are like places for false Messiah’s to appear, as 
they’d be either fasting or praying.

&MATT 25
1|”At that time, God’s interaction with mankind (the kingdom of heaven) will 
be analogous to ten misses[a], each of whom took a lamp of her own to greet the 
groom.[A] 
2|Five of them were stupid and five were prudent. 
3|The stupid ones took 
their lamps but didn’t take with them any spare oil. 
4|The five prudent ones took 
flasks of spare oil in addition to their lamps. 
5|The groom was delayed in coming and 
they all got tired and dozed off. 
6|In the middle of the night, a shout went out, ‘Here 
comes the groom! Get out and greet him!’. 
7|Then all those misses woke up and 
trimmed their lamps. 
8|The stupid ones said to the prudent ones, ‘Give us some of 
your oil, since our lamps are about to go out.’ 
9|But the prudent ones replied, ‘In case 
there’s not enough for both you and us, we’d all be better off if you go to where it’s sold 
and buy some for yourselves.’ 
10|While going out to buy some, the groom arrived, 
and those who were prepared entered with him into the wedding and the door was 
shut behind them. 
11|Finally, the rest of the misses came saying, ‘Sir, Sir—open up 
for us.’ 
12|But he answered, ‘I’m telling you, I really don’t know you all.’ 

13|Consequently, be ever on the alert, because you don’t know the day or the hour.
          
14|”What we’ve been talking about here is just like a man going on a long 
excursion who called his employees[B] and entrusted them with what he owned. 

15|To one he gave $4 million[C], to one he gave $1.6 million, to one he gave 
$800,000, distributing to each according to each one’s ability. Then he departed. Right 
away, 
16|the one with the $4 million took the money and invested it and gained 
another $4 million in return. 
17|In the same manner, the one with $1.6 million went 
and gained another $1.6 million. 
18|But the one who was given the $800,000 dug a 
hole in the ground and hid his boss’s money. 
19|After a long time passed, the boss 
returned and settled their accounts. 
20|When he met with him, the one who was 
given the $4 million brought with him the other $4 million and said, ‘Boss, you 
entrusted me with $4 million. See, I gained another $4 million’. 
21|The boss said, 
‘Good job, you good and faithful employee. You were faithful with a little; you will be 
appointed over much. Come celebrate with me.[b]’ 
22|The employee with the $1.6 
million too came and said, ‘See, I gained another $1.6 million’. 
23|The boss said, 
‘Good job, you good and faithful employee. You were faithful with a little; you will be 
appointed over much. Come celebrate with me.[b]’ 
24|The employee who had kept 
the $800,000 came and said, ‘Boss, I know how hard-nosed you are, taking a cut of 
something you never invested in, and expecting a return on something you’re not 
entitled to[c]. 
25|I was afraid, so I went out and hid your $800,000 underground. 
See—here’s your money back.’ 
26|The boss replied to him, “What a bad, sorry 
employee you are—and lazy too. You knew that I was the type who takes a cut of 
something I never invested in and expects a return on something I wasn’t entitled to. 

27|You should’ve just put the money in the bank, and I would’ve gotten my money 
back with interest on top. 
28|Take that $800,000 from him and give it to the one 
who has $8 million…’ 
29|Indeed, it will be added—and added many times over—
to the one who has a lot already. But from the one who doesn’t have much, what he has 
will be taken away from him.[d] 
30|’…And throw that worthless employee out into 
the Outer Darkness—the place where the weeping and gnashing of teeth will be[e].’
          
31|”When the Man[f] comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then 
he’ll sit upon a glorious[g] throne, one that a judge sits on. 
32|All the peoples of the 
world will be gathered before him, and he’ll separate them from each other, just like a 
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 
33|The sheep—he’ll set those to the 
right of him, but the goats—he’ll set those to the left of him.[D] 
34|Then the king 
will say to those on his right, “Come, you whom my Father is pleased with, and take 
ownership of and move into[E] the kingdom that has been prepared for you from the 
beginning of time. 
35|The fact is, I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat; 
I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink; I was an outsider among you, and 
you took me into your group; 
36|naked, and you clothed me; ill, and you stopped 
by to check up on me; in jail, and you went to me. 
37|Then the righteous answered 
him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and fed you, thirsty and gave you something 
to drink? 
38|When did we see that you were an outsider and took you into our 
group, or naked and clothed you? 
39|When did we see you ill or in prison and 
went to you?’ 
40|The king answered, ‘I’m telling you the truth, insofar as you’ve 
done it to one of these comrades[h] of mine—the most insignificant comrades—you’ve 
done it to me. 
41|Then he’ll also say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me you 
damnable people to the Eternal Fire which was prepared for the devil and his agents 
consisting of demons[i]. 
42|The fact is, I was hungry, and you didn’t give me anything 
to eat; was thirsty, and you didn’t give me anything to drink; 
43|an outsider, and 
you wouldn’t take me into your group; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; ill and in jail, 
and you didn’t stop by to check on me.’ 
44|Then they too replied saying, ‘Lord 
when did we see you hungry, thirsty, an outsider, ill, or in jail and did not attend to 
you?’ 
45|Then he answered them, ‘I’m telling you the truth, insofar as you didn’t 
do it to one of these comrades of mine—the most insignificant comrades—you didn’t do 
it to me.’ 
*[a]misses…Lit: virgins. These are young ladies in their late teens to early twenties, women eligible for 
marriage but not married yet.
*[b]Come celebrate with me…Lit: Enter into the joy of your lord. An idiom; ref. note of Acts 19:8.
*[c]taking a cut of something you never invested in, and expecting a return on something you’re not 
entitled to…Lit: reaps from what he did not sow and gathers from where he did not scatter
*[d]from the one who doesn’t have much, what he has will be taken away from him…Lit: For to the one 
having all things, it will be given and it will be abounding; from the one not having, that which he has will 
be taken away from him
*[e]weeping and gnashing of teeth…Ref. note in Matt. 8:12
*[f]the Man…Lit: Son of Man. Ref. note in Matt. 8:20
*[g]a glorious throne…Lit: a throne of his glory. The awkward wording is a figure of speech.
*[h]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[i]his agents consisting of demons…Lit: his angels

*[A]took a lamp of her own to greet the groom…The virgins waiting to greet the groom as he comes are 
part of the ancient Jewish marriage ritual. Often the groom was late in coming; not being prepared for 
this contingency was foolish. Not having these virgins there to greet the groom, lamps in hand, is 
somewhat analogous to bridesmaids not showing up at the wedding because their dresses weren’t 
ready. If one can imagine the fury a bride would have if some of her bridesmaids didn’t show up, this is 
the same anger the groom has here.
*[B]employees…Lit: slaves; servants. Some liberty taken in using employees instead of slaves, as slavery in 
the form that it existed at that time is too foreign for us to relate too. In the institution of slavery as it 
existed in the 19th century, a master would’ve never entrusted slaves like the master did in this parable, 
nor would 19th century slaves been able to transact business in their master’s stead.
*[C]$4 million…The actual quantity of silver was five talents, two talents, and one talent. One talent 
weighed 71lbs (32.3kg). Ref. conversion note in Matt. 18:28. 1, which specifies in today’s dollars, for an 
industrialized nation, $25/gram of silver. Therefore, the equivalent purchasing power of these amounts 
are valued at $4 million for five talents, $1.6 million for two talents, and $800,000 for one talent.
*[D]he’ll set those to the left of him…In the GT, the words here are right and left are used. These are 
usually translated right hand and left hand. The right hand indicates favor with Jesus; the left symbolizes 
disfavor.
[E]take ownership of and move into…Lit: inherit. Ref. note of Luke 10:25.

Matthew
*[E]take ownership of and move into…Lit: inherit. Ref. note of Luke 10:25.

Matthew
46|These will go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to that special 
fullness of life (eternal life).”


&MATT 26
1|When Jesus finished up all these messages, he said to his disciples, 
2|”You 
know that the Passover will be in two days, and the Man[a] is going to be arrested 
resulting in his crucifixion.” 
3|At that time, the chief priests and the councilmen[b] held 
a council in the courtyard of the High Priest Caiaphas. 
4|In that council, they decided 
that they must get ahold of Jesus and kill him. 
5|They kept saying, “Not in the midst of 
the festival, lest the people riot.”
          
6|While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper, 
7|a woman 
came to him with a jar of expensive myrrh and poured it all out on his head while he 
was sitting at the table[c]. 
8|Seeing this, the disciples were enraged saying, “Why the 
waste? 
9|We could’ve sold this for a lot of money and given the proceeds to the poor.” 

10|Aware of this, Jesus told them, “Why do you have a problem with the lady? The 
fact is, she did a good deed on my behalf. 
11|You see, you’ll always have the poor 
among you, but you won’t have me around forever. 
12|The fact is, she slathered 
this myrrh on my body in order to embalm me. 
13|I’m telling you the truth—
wherever in the world this good news[d] here is proclaimed, what she did will also be 
talked about and specially remembered[e].”
          
14|Then one of the Twelve named Judas Iscariot went to the high priest 

15|and said, “How much would you pay for me to betray him, getting him handed 
over into your custody[f]?” They agreed to a price of $10,000[A]. 
16|From then on he 
began to look for an opportunity to facilitate his arrest by betrayal.
          
17|On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples said to 
Jesus, “How would you like us to make Passover preparations for you?” 
18|He 
said, “Go into the city to so-and-so and ask him, ‘The Teacher says, “I’ll soon be ready 
for my disciples and me to observe the Passover at your place”.’” 
19|The disciples 
did what Jesus told them to do and made preparations for the Passover. 
20|When 
evening came, he was at the table[c] with the Twelve. 
21|While they were eating, he 
said, “I’m telling you the truth—one of you all will betray me.” 
22|Being deeply 
grieved, they started telling him over and over, each one of them, “No way it’s me, right 
Lord?” 
23|He came up with a reply and said, “Whoever raises his glass to offer a 
toast[B]—this is the guy who’ll betray me. 
24|While, indeed, the Man follows the 
trajectory defined for him in Scripture[g], on the other hand, there are bad things in 
store[h] for that fellow who’ll betray him: that guy would be better off if he’d never been 
born.” 
25|Judas, his betrayer, responded, “No way it’s me, right Teacher[C]?” Jesus, 
engaged by the remark, said, “You said it, not me.[i]”
          
26|While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, offered up 
thanksgiving, and broke it[j] and gave it to his disciples and said, “Take it and eat it: this 
is my body.” 
27|He took a cup, offered up thanksgiving, and gave it to them 
saying, “All of you—drink some: 
28|for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, 
which on behalf of many is being poured out as a forgiveness of sins. 
29|I tell you 
in no uncertain terms that I will definitely not drink this here produce of the vineyard 
from now until that day in which I will drink it with you anew in my Father’s 
kingdom.” 
30|After they sang some hymns, they departed for the Mount of Olives.
          
31|Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall out with me[k] tonight, since 
it’s been prophesied,

“I will strike the shepherd,
And his flock will scatter


32|”After my resurrection, I’ll go on out ahead of you to Galilee.” 
33|Peter 
responded to the statement and replied, “Even if everyone else falls out with you, I 
never will.” 
34|Jesus said to him, “I’m telling you, this very night you will deny me 
before a rooster crows three times.” 
35|Peter, in line with what he’d been told, said 
to him, “Even if I have to die together with you, I’ll definitely not deny you.” All the 
other disciples said the same thing.
          
36|Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and prompts 
the disciples, “Sit here somewhere until I’m done praying over there.” 
37|Taking 
along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and to be in anguish. 

38|Engaging them in conversation, he said to them, “My soul is thoroughly 
grieved to the point of death: stay here with me and stay alert.” 
39|He ventured 
out a bit and fell on his face in prayer saying, “My Father, if it’s possible, let this ordeal[l] 
pass by and go away from me; nevertheless, not what I want but what you want.” 

40|He went to his disciples and found them sleeping, and he, sizing things up, said 
to Peter, “You all didn’t have the strength to stay focused with me for a short period of 
time[C]? 
41|Stay focused and keep praying, so that you don’t enter into and fall prey 
to temptation. The spirit desires indeed; the flesh though is weak.” 
42|Again, a 
second time, he went out to pray saying, “My Father, if it isn’t possible for this to pass 
by (that is, if I were to not drink of it), let Your will come to pass.” 
43|He came 
again and found them sleeping, as their eyelids had grown heavy. 
44|Leaving 
them again, he went out to pray, saying the same thing for the third time. 
45|Then 
he went to his disciples and, continuing to engage them, said, “Have you been sleeping 
in the meantime, getting rested up?…See now, the moment has arrived and the Man is 
being betrayed and taken into the hands of sinners—
46|Get up, let’s get going!—
Look! My betrayer has arrived!”
          
47|While he was still speaking, at once Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived 
with a large crowd, with swords and clubs, sent from the high priest and the 
councilmen. 
48|His betrayer arranged ahead of time for there to be a signal saying, 
“Whomever I kiss, he’s the one; seize him.” 
49|He went straight over to Jesus and 
said, “Delighted to see you, Teacher[D]!”[m], and kissed him cordially” 
50|Jesus said 
to him, “What brings you here, bro[n]?” They then went over and laid their hands on 
Jesus and apprehended him.
          
51|And, like that, one of the people who were with Jesus drew his sword 
and struck the high priest’s slave, slicing his ear off. 
52|Then Jesus said to him, 
“Put your sword back where it belongs; you see, everyone who draws a sword in order 
to use it will perish by a sword. 
53|Or, do you suppose that I don’t have the ability 
to ask my Father, and right this moment He’ll post alongside me more than twelve 
legions of angels? 
54|So now, how would all those verses in the Old Testament be 
fulfilled that say that things have to turn out this way?” 
55|At that hour Jesus said 
to the crowd, “You came out to apprehend me with swords and clubs like you were 
cornering a thug[o]. Day after day I was sitting in the temple teaching and you didn’t 
seize me. 
56|All of this happened so that Old Testament prophecies[p] would be 
fulfilled.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and began to flee.
          
57|They took Jesus into custody and led him to the high priest Caiaphas, 
where the designated teachers[q] and councilmen had gathered. 
58|Peter followed 
him at a distance all the way to the high priest’s courtyard and entered it and sat with 
the attendants in order to see how things would turn out. 
59|The high priests and 
the entire Council[E] were trying to find those who would give false, compelling 
testimony[F] under oath against Jesus, so that they could have him killed, 
60|and, 
while many were stepping forward and saying phony things in court, they couldn’t 
find any. But finally two came forward 
61|and said, ”This is the guy who said, ‘I 
can tear down God’s temple and build it back up in three days’ time’.” 
62|The high 
priest stood up and said to him, “You have nothing to say in response?” 
63|But 
Jesus kept silent. The high priest said to him, “For the love of God[r], I charge you to 
testify here before us if you are the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of God.” 
64|Jesus, 
in full awareness, told them, “Whatever. But one thing I’ll tell you is this: From here on 
out, you will see, ‘The Man in his role as an all-powerful right-hand man and see him 
coming upon the clouds of the sky’[G].” 
65|Then the high priest got unglued and in 
a rage starting breaking things,[H] all the while saying, “He just blasphemed! Why do we 
need to hear any more testimony? You all heard him blaspheme here! 
66|What 
have you decided?” They replied, “We sentence him to death.” 
67|They then spat 
in his face and beat him. They slapped him while 
68|saying, “Prophesy for us, 
Messiah: who slapped you?”
          
69|Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the teen servant-
girls went up to him and said, “Weren’t you with Jesus of Galilee too?” 
70|He 
denied it in front of everyone saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 

71|After he left through the entrance gate, another servant girl saw him and told 
those nearby, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.” 
72|Again he denied it, 
swearing, “I don’t know the man.” 
73|A little while later, those who were standing 
nearby confronted Peter, “Seriously—you too are one of them, since you too talk with 
the same accent.” 
74|Then he began to cuss and swear up and down, “I don’t know 
the man.” Immediately a rooster crowed. 
*[a]the Man…Lit: Son of Man. Ref. note in Matt. 8:20

*[A]$10,000…The GT says “thirty pieces of silver”. It’s fair to assume that these pieces of silver are shekels. 
By coincidence or not, this is the price of a slave specified in Exod. 21:32. If each shekel contained 14 
grams of silver, and if in today’s equivalent purchasing power silver would be priced at $25/gram (ref. 
note in Matt. 18:28), then that’s 420g of silver or approximately $10,000.
*[B]Whoever raises his glass to offer a toast…Raising a glass to offer a toast is a loose analogy in our 
modern world of the actual ancient tradition; the GT actually reads, The one who dips his hand in the 
dish with me. Dipping hands in the dish was an ancient custom done during meals where one person 
dips a piece of bread into a dish containing olive oil or something and put it into a fellow diner’s mouth. 
It’s a celebration of fellowship. This is a bit like our tradition at a wedding or some place, where a couple 
locks arms and each drinks from a champagne glass that the other is holding.
*[C]for a short period of time…Lit: one hour. One hour is a NT expression (also used in Gal. 2:5). The word 
hour itself is used idiomatically this way throughout the NT. As such, one hour is not to be taken exactly.
*[D]Teacher…Lit: Rabbi. The Aramaic word for teacher is used here, whereas the Gk. word for teacher is 
used in v.18. This contrast emphasizes Judas’s false reverence and deceit.
*[E]the Council…Lit: the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin were a ruling council of Jewish elders that constituted a 
high court
*[F]compelling testimony…The testimony of two or three witnesses (Deut. 19:15) in an ancient Israeli law 
court was required for conviction. Their court proceedings relied on witnesses instead of material 
evidence.
*[G]The Man in his role as an all-powerful right-hand and see him coming upon the clouds of the sky…Lit: 
the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming upon the clouds of the skies. This is a 
conglomeration of Ps. 110:1 and Dan. 7:13. Also, the phrase sitting at the right hand of power is a figure 
of speech. Also ref. Matt. 22:44.
[H]Then the high priest got unglued and in a rage starting breaking things…Lit: Then the high priest tore 
his clothing. Liberties taken. Tearing of one’s clothing is an ancient Israeli custom seen throughout the 
OT. It is symbolic of an inner fury, rage, resolve, or repentance. 

Matthew

Matthew
75|And Peter remembered what Jesus 
had said, that before a rooster sounded off he would deny him three times, and he left 
that place weeping bitterly.


&MATT 27
1|At the break of day, all of the high priests and the councilmen[a] met in a 
council that was convened against Jesus in order to have him killed. 
2|They tied him 
up, transferred him to the governor Pilate, and thereby placed him in his custody.
          
3|Then the traitor Judas, seeing that he was condemned, changed his mind and 
returned the thirty coins[b] to the high priests and the councilmen 
4|saying, “It’s a sin 
to betray the blood of an innocent man.” They said, “What do we care? That’s your 
problem.” 
5|He tossed the money into the collection box for the temple fund[A], 
departed, and went out and hung himself. 
6|The chief priests took the money and 
said, “We’re not allowed to put this into the temple fund, since it’s a blood payment.” 

7|They had a meeting over it, took the money, and bought the potter’s field[B] with it, 
to be used as a graveyard for foreigners. 
8|For this reason, that field’s called the Blood 
Field nowadays. 
9|Only then was the Prophet Jeremiah’s prophecy fulfilled, which 
says,

And they took the thirty-coin payment
The price that had been paid by the ultimate Israelites[C]

10|And they paid for the potter’s field
According to the arrangements made by my Lord

          
11|Now Jesus was made to appear before the governor, and the governor, in 
his inquisition, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “Whatever 
you say.[c]” 
12|He made no defense against the accusations put forth by the chief 
priests and councilmen. 
13|Then Pilate, continuing with the questioning, said to 
him, “Don’t you hear how severe the charges are that they’re accusing you of?” 

14|He wouldn’t say a word in reply; as a result, the governor was stupefied.
          
15|According to a holiday custom, the governor would release one prisoner, 
any prisoner that the crowd wanted. 
16|At that time they had interned a notorious 
prisoner named Barabbas. 
17|While they were conferring amongst themselves, 
Pilate took the opportunity to say to them, “Who do you want me to set free, Barabbas 
or Jesus, who’s called the Messiah?”, 
18|since he knew that it was because of their 
jealousy that they’d handed him over to him. 
19|While he was there presiding as 
judge,[d] his wife sent him word saying, “Don’t get mixed up with that do-gooder[e], 
since I’ve been really upset all day because of a dream I had about him.” 
20|But the 
chief priests and the councilmen persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas, so that Jesus 
would be disposed of. 
21|Having considered the matter, the governor said to them,
      “Which of these two do you want me to set free?”
      They said, “Barabbas!”
          
22|Not quitting, Pilate said, “What shall I do then with Jesus, who’s called 
the Messiah?” 
      But making no difference, they all said, “Let him be crucified!”
          
23|He said, “Just what has he done wrong?”
      But they began to yell louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”

24|Seeing that nothing was helping, but instead a riot was forming, he took some 
water and washed his hands in it in front of the crowd saying, “Don’t blame me for this 
man’s blood; it’s your problem now[f].” 
25|And everyone in the crowd responded, 
“Let the blame fall on us and our children![g]” 
26|Then he set Barabbas free, but he 
flogged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.
          
27|Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus to where the governor’s palace 
guard assembled, and the entire unit of guards descended on him. 
28|They stripped 
his clothes from him and put a red soldier’s cloak around him, 
29|and they wove a 
crown of thorns and placed it on his head and put a stick[h] in his right hand, and they 
got down on their knees in front of him and toyed with him saying, “Delighted to see 
you,[i] King of the Jews.” 
30|They spat on him and took the stick and began to hit 
his head. 
31|When they were finished making fun of him, they took the cloak off 
him, put his clothes back on him, and led him forth to crucifixion.
          
32|While heading out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and 
they conscripted this fellow to bear his cross. 
33|Having arrived at a place called 
Golgotha, which is called the Skull Place, 
34|they gave him wine mixed with a 
bitter spice[j] to drink, and when he tasted it, he didn’t want to drink any more of it. 

35|So they crucified him, rolled dice[k] to divvy up his clothes, 
36|took a seat, 
and proceeded to keep track of him there. 
37|They put a sign indicating the reason 
for his crucifixion over his head which read, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.” 
38|At 
that time, there were two thugs[l] crucified with him, one to the right of him and one to 
the left of him. 
39|Those who came by reviled him, nodding their heads back and 
forth 
40|and saying, “The one who’ll supposedly destroy the temple and rebuild it in 
three days…Save yourself, if you’re God’s son…Let him come down from the cross.” 

41|In the same way, the chief priests, along with the designated teachers[m] and the 
Pharisees, taunted him saying over and over, 
42|”He rescued others but he can’t 
rescue himself…So, he’s the King of Israel…Let’s see him come down from the cross 
now, and we’ll believe in him…
43|He placed his trust in God; let Him rescue him 
now if He wants him, since he said that he’s God’s son.” 
44|Likewise, the thugs 
who were selected to be crucified with him insulted him.
          
45|Starting at noon, darkness came over the whole earth, lasting until three 
in the afternoon. 
46|Around three, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lama 
sabachthani?”, which is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?[D]” 

47|Some who were standing there and who heard it were saying over and over, 
“He’s calling for Elijah.” 
48|Immediately, one of them ran and fetched a sponge 
fully soaked with vinegar wine[E], put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink. 

49|The rest of the people there proceeded to say, “Let’s see if Elijah comes and 
saves him.” 
50|Again Jesus cried out in a loud voice and gave up the ghost[n]. 

51|And—just like that—the temple curtain[F] was torn in two from top to bottom, 
the rocks were shaken, 
52|and the tombs[G] were opened up and many faithful 
believers who had died were resurrected[o], 
53|and with his resurrection left the 
tombs and went into the holy city and appeared to lots of people. 
54|The captain of 
the guard and those who were keeping track of Jesus with him, seeing the earthquake 
and all the things that had happened, became really frightened, saying, “This guy really 
was the embodiment of a son of God[p].” 
55|Now there were many women there 
who came to watch the affair from a distance, some of whom had been Jesus’s followers 
from the Galilean days, attending to him. 
56|Among them was Mary Magdalene, 
James’s and Joseph’s mother Mary, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
          
57|At sunset a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself had 
also been discipled by Jesus—
58|This fellow approached Pilate and asked for 
Jesus’s body. Pilate then ordered for it to be given away. 
59|Joseph took the body 
and wrapped it in clean linen, 
60|placed it in his newly-made tomb, which had 
been hewn into the rock, rolled a huge stone over to the tomb’s entrance, and left. 

61|Now, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sat down across from the tomb.
          
62|That night[q], which is a day of preparation for the festival[H], the chief 
priests and the Pharisees got together and went to Pilate 
63|and said, “Sir, we 
remember what that grifter said while he was still alive, that he would be resurrected 
after three days. 
64|Therefore, give the order that the tomb be kept secure under 
guard from now until the third day comes, lest his disciples come and steal his body[r] and 
tell the people, “He rose from the dead”; a final such deception would be worse than 
any deceiving he did before[s].” 
65|Pilate said to them, “You’ll get your guard; go 
out and secure it the best you know how.” 
*[a]councilmen…Lit: elders
*[b]thirty coins…The thirty silver coins here are equivalent to $10,000 in today’s dollars. Ref. note in Matt 
26:15.
*[c]whatever you say…Lit: You said. Same phrase as used in Matt. 26:64; ref. note there.
*[d]While he was there presiding as judge…Lit: While sitting on his judgment seat
*[e]Don’t get mixed up with that do-gooder…Lit: nothing to you and to that righteous man. Same 
expression used in John 2:4.
*[f]it’s your problem now…This is the same phrase used in v. 4, That’s your problem. The phrase literally 
reads, you see, short for, you see to it.
*[g]Let the blame fall on us and our children!…Lit: His blood upon us and upon our children. Also, by 
implication, children here means descendants.
*[h]stick…Probably a rod made of reeds or some similar plant, something more substantial than a simple 
reed, which is the common translation of this word, so it would be more like a cane.
*[i]Delighted to see you…Same phrase that Judas spoke to Jesus when he met him in Gethsemane in Matt. 
26:49
*[j]wine mixed with a bitter spice…The bitter spice is likely myrrh. Ref. note of Mark 15:23.
*[k]rolled dice…Lit: cast lots. Ref. note of Mark 15:24.
*[l]thugs…Lit: robbers
*[m]designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes
*[n]gave up the ghost…Lit: sent the spirit away. English expression derived from KJV rendering of Matt. 
27:50, yielded up the spirit.
*[o]many faithful believers who had died were resurrected…Lit: many bodies of the saints who had gone to 
sleep were raised
*[p]A son of God…ref. note of Mark 15:39
*[q]That night…Lit: the next day. The Jewish day starts at sundown.
*[r]his body…Lit: him
*[s]a final such deception would be worse than any deceiving he did before…Lit: and the final deception 
will be worse than the first. A figure of speech.

*[A]tossed the money into the collection box for the temple fund…Lit: He threw the money into the 
temple…Assumption is that the word temple here is short for temple korban, which is the temple fund. 
The word korban is used in v.6. Implication is that he indicated one way or another that money to go to 
the temple fund. He may have indicated through some gesture or some other means that the money be 
designated for the temple fund, then threw it on the floor in their sight. The details are not specified.
*[B]the potter’s field…The impression from the GT is that the “potter’s field” was a well-known location in 
the first century.
*[C]The price that had been paid by the ultimate Israelites…In the GT, the word payment in various forms 
is repeated four times in the quotation from Jeremiah used here. Using the same word, it reads, And 
they took the thirty silver coins, the payment that had been paid, which was paid by the Sons of Israel. 
Such repetition is a figure of speech. Furthermore, the Sons of Israel is also a figure of speech that can 
be rendered a number of ways: the ultimate Israelites, the true Israelites, the best Israeli representatives, 
those Israelites who faithfully follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.
*[D]Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani…This is one of the places in the NT where a Hebrew phrase is quoted 
verbatim. In Matthew, most other foreign words are in Aramaic, not Hebrew, since Aramaic was their 
common tongue, not Hebrew. Hebrew is the language of Judaism, and Jesus is clearly quoting the 
beginning of Psalm 22. Those who do not receive Jesus are fond of quoting my God, my God, why have 
you forsaken me as Jesus’s great moment of doubt and regret. It is neither. Jesus is asking a fair question 
to God, one which he completely knows the answer to, but asks it nevertheless. It is a figure of speech; 
what Jesus is really saying is, “I’m innocent, I don’t deserve this.”
*[E]vinegar wine…This was wine which had gone sour and turned into vinegar. It was a common drink of 
soldiers and was actually was refreshing for those who were working hard. In addition, drinking wine 
mixed with water, whether the wine has soured into vinegar or not, was commonplace in ancient times, 
for the practical reason of eliminating bacteria from the water. However, in Luke’s account (Luke 23:36), 
the soldiers mock him by giving him such a poor drink; doing so is also prophesied in the OT.
*[F]the temple curtain…Within the temple there is a chamber called the Holy Place, and the Holy Place is 
divided into two sub-chambers separated by a veil. Behind this veil is the Holy of Holies. This the temple 
curtain referred to in v. 51. The Holy of Holies is the most sacred place in all of ancient Judaism, the 
place where God dwells. When the temple curtain was torn in two, God’s presence departed from the 
Holy of Holies, never to return.
*[G]the tombs…Lit: sepulchers. Ref. Matt. 23:29. These are above-ground tombs, and it’s likely that those 
who were dead who were resurrected had died recently and their body hadn’t decayed much yet.
[H]a day of preparation for the festival…In addition to Saturdays being Sabbath days, Jewish religious 
holidays were also Sabbaths, and the restrictions covering the Sabbath applied to these holy days as 
well. This meant that no work could be done on the Passover, being a Sabbath. Therefore, duties such as 
meals had to be completed the day before. Such a day is designated “a day of preparation.”

Matthew

Matthew
66|So they went and secured the tomb, 
having fortified the rock as it stood against the entrance.


&MATT 28
1|After the back-to-back Sabbaths had ended,[A] at the first light of day on 
Sunday, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to take a look at the tomb. 

2|Wouldn’t you know—a huge convulsion had occurred; in fact, an angel sent from 
the Lord descended from out of the sky, went over to the stone, rolled it away, and sat 
down on top of it. 
3|His appearance resembled lightning, and his outerwear was as 
white as snow. 
4|Terrified of him, those keeping guard trembled violently until finally 
becoming as stiff as the dead, laid out on the ground[a]. 
5|The angel summed the 
situation up and said to the women, “Don’t be afraid, since I know that you’re looking 
for Jesus, the one who was crucified. 
6|He’s not here, since he was resurrected just 
like he said he would be: go look at the place where he was laid to rest. 
7|And—
quickly now—go tell his disciples that he’s been resurrected from the dead, and in the 
meantime he’ll be heading out to Galilee ahead of you; you’ll see him there.”
          
8|Quickly, and in a state of great fear and joy, they left the tomb and raced to 
tell his disciples. 
9|And out of nowhere, Jesus interrupted them saying, “Delighted to 
see you[b]” They went to him and grabbed ahold of his feet, having prostrated themselves 
in worship before him. 
10|Then Jesus, getting to the point, said to them, “Don’t be 
afraid. Continue on your way and make the announcement to my comrades in order 
that they too will head out to Galilee, and that they’ll see me there.”
          
11|While they were on their way, another thing was afoot—some of the 
guards went into the city to tell the chief priests everything that had happened. 

12|They gathered the councilmen[c] and met with them, and then they got a 
sizeable amount of cash to give to the soldiers 
13|saying, “Say that his disciples 
came during the night and stole him while you were sleeping. 
14|If this gets 
reported to the governor, we personally will smooth things over with him and fix it so 
that you won’t have anything to worry about.” 
15|They took the cash and did as 
they were coached to do. And this account has been circulated among the Jews until the 
present day.
          
16|The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus told 
them to go to, 
17|and when they saw him, they bowed before him in worship—but 
they just couldn’t believe it[B]. 
18|Jesus came over to them and had a talk with 
them, “All authority in heaven and upon the earth has been given to me. 

19|Therefore, go make disciples of people everywhere in the world, baptizing them 
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
*[a]becoming as stiff as the dead, laid out on the ground…Lit: became like the dead
*[b]Delighted to see you…Lit: joy. Ref. note in Matt. 26:49
*[c]the councilmen…Lit: the elders
*[d]instructing…Also: teaching
*[e]I personally will be with you…Lit: I am with you
*[f]until this present era is all wrapped up…Lit: until the consummation of the age. Ref. Matt. 13:39

*[A]After the back-to-back Sabbaths had ended…Lit: Well after the Sabbaths were over, at the first light of 
the first day from the Sabbaths. As the Jewish day begins at sundown, dawn is “well after” a Sabbath. 
The Sabbaths in v. 1 is plural, but idiomatically using the plural for the singular when referring to days of 
the week occurs a few times in the NT (putting aside this verse and the parallel ones in Mark 16:2, Luke 
24:1, John 20:1, John 20:19, this idiomatic form is found in Luke 4:16; Acts 16:13; Acts 20:7). But there 
were, in fact, two consecutive Sabbaths, the Passover and a Saturday, not just a single Sabbath. This 
helps with the math of reconciling Jesus being supposedly crucified on a Friday and raised from the dead 
on a Sunday; how does that add up to three days? Nor does this account for the three day and three 
night duration called out in Matt. 12:40. To achieve a span of three days and three nights, Jesus 
would’ve been crucified on a Wednesday, the day of preparation (Matt. 27:62), and the three days and 
three nights consisted of Wed. night, Thurs. day, Thurs. night, Fri. day, Fri. night, Fri. day. And he was 
resurrected on Saturday evening, while several hours later, early Sunday morning, the women 
discovered that he’d already been resurrected.
[B]they just couldn’t believe it…Lit: but they doubted. This is partly a figure of speech and partly true; they 
didn’t actually doubt that Jesus was there, but it’s like we say when we unexpectedly meet a friend 
somewhere whom you haven’t seen in a long time, “I still can’t believe that you’re here,” or, “I just can’t 
believe I’m talking to you after all of these years.” You know that they’re there, but the unexpectedness 
of it all has left you in a somewhat bewildered, excited state. On the other hand, they didn’t know what 
or if they should even believe it at all, as further detail is revealed in Luke 24:41–43.


The Gospel of Mark
       According to church tradition, Mark is the one referred to as John-Mark, son of Mary, in Acts 
15:37, to whose house Peter went after the angel freed him from the prison in Jerusalem. John-Mark is 
also the cousin of Barnabas. Some believe that his mother Mary is the one who furnished the upper 
room used for the Last Supper and also used on the day of Pentecost. Some believe that the “young 
man” whom Mark refers to in Mark 14:51,52 is none other than himself, corroborating the theories. But 
most agree that the “Mark my son” whom Peter refers to in 1 Pet. 5:13 is the same John-Mark and is the 
author of the Gospel of Mark.
       Mark was not actually Peter’s son, but he was a close enough companion and brother that Peter 
claims him as his figurative son, not only a son in the faith but a son in relation. Church tradition says 
that Mark was Peter’s interpreter, likely interpreting Aramaic into Greek as Peter itinerated throughout 
the Roman Empire. Serving as Peter’s interpreter, Mark would re-tell the same stories over and over 
again. He also spent a lot of time with Peter, everything from travelling to dining. No doubt, Mark spoke 
to Peter a lot and asked many questions about the missing details of the life of Jesus.
       Also according to church tradition, Peter was martyred in Rome. Mark was there at that time, 
and the brethren asked him to commit all of what Peter had told him over the years to a book. This book 
is the Gospel of Mark. Mark’s gospel is written to a Roman audience, so it does not dwell on things that 
would be interesting to a Jewish believer of the day who believed in the Messiah. Mark’s gospel is full of 
drama, action, encounters, confrontation. The teachings it contains are more down-to-earth than 
Matthew or Luke, though they are wrapped in analogy (parable) as Jesus taught them.
       Mark’s Greek is simple. He does not have the command of the language that Luke and Paul do, 
and his Gospel makes repeated use of simple words rather than drawing on less common, more specific 
words. There’s rich detail in the description of characters that looks like it came straight from the mouth 
of Peter. It vividly paints a familiarity with the character. For example, the story of the woman with the 
hemorrhage, which begins in Mark 5:25. The details give us a clear picture of this woman’s ordeal:
       A woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, having suffered a great deal at the 
hands of many doctors, spending everything she had—and nothing was helping but instead 
things were trending more to the worse…
       The details about the length of her affliction and how she had spent everything she had trying to 
find a cure leaves a stronger impression than if Mark had simply wrote, “there was a woman who had a 
really bad hemorrhage…”
       Another example comes from the story of Herod and John the Baptist. Herod kept John locked 
up in jail, and with detail Mark supplies about Herod (Mark 6:19,20), one acquires a familiarity with 
Herod:
       So Herodias maintained a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and wasn’t 
yet able to do so, since, throughout, Herod had a reverential awe of John, knowing him to be an 
upstanding man, right in the eyes of God and holy, and was keeping him safe. After listening to 
him many times, he became conflicted, yet still enjoyed listening to him.
       …the story continues after Herod’s stepdaughter finishes her dance. The silly girl “rejoined the 
party with hasty eagerness”; one can feel the glee coursing through her cruel, juvenile head.
       He swore up and down to her multiple times, “Whatever you ask me for, I’ll give it to 
you—anything you want—anything at all.” She excused herself and said to her mother, “What 
should I ask for?” Her mother said, “John the Baptist’s head.” Straightaway she rejoined the 
party and with hasty eagerness said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a 
platter—right now.”
       On the other hand, Mark is loud, clumsy, and careless as a writer, in spite of apparently having a 
scribe work with him to proof-read his Greek and to translate words for obscure objects and the like. In 
spite of his simple use of Greek, the translator must pause and think what Mark meant to say. He over-
uses the imperfect and present subjunctive tenses for effect. He uses and when he should use or and 
vice-versa (ex: Mark 11:28). He gets some simple events out of sequence, like Mark 12:8, where it 
literally reads, “They took him, killed him, and drove him outside of the vineyard.” As correlated with 
Matt. 21:39, he means, “They took him, drove him some place outside of the vineyard, and killed him 
there.” In other words, they first drove him out of the vineyard then killed him, not the other way 
around.
       Modern criticism asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel first, then it became the basis for Matthew 
and Luke. The critics are quick to dismiss reports from early church witnesses who contradict this theory, 
and are slow to propose theories of how the commonality could have come about.
       Another point of contention is the ending of Mark’s gospel, Mark 16:9–20. A footnote in a 
contemporary translation such as the NASB states that this ending is missing from two of the oldest 
manuscripts. Modern critics claim that the ending of Mark has been lost for all time, seizing upon this in 
their eagerness to poke holes in the integrity of the Scriptures. We do not have the detail of information 
we would like to solve this mystery, however there are enough fragments scattered over time to 
postulate a likely scenario. This is analogous to how the NTSB determines causes of crashes in smaller 
aircraft: they sift through the evidence and eliminate possibilities until they’re left with the “likely” 
cause of the crash. They cannot say with absolute certainty what caused the crash, but they can state 
with confidence what likely caused the accident.
       In this train of thought, the mystery of the ending of Mark is likely explained in this way: the 
ending was intentionally truncated from certain manuscripts in the late third or early fourth centuries by 
order of one in authority, perhaps even Eusebius of Caesarea himself. The reason this person did so was 
because he refused to believe what was written in Mark 16:16-19. Ironically, these manuscripts, which 
are called the Alexandrian text-type, are the most accurate in most every other respect to the originals, 
as the editors who produced them made a concerted effort to eradicate the false emendations (mostly 
insertions) which had accumulated over time in manuscripts everywhere, most likely in the second and 
third centuries, and they predate any false changes made in the fourth century and onwards. To a large 
extent, scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries, observing the faithfulness and accuracy of the hand of 
correction which guided the Alexandrian manuscripts, could not fathom that the same party who had 
corrected so many verses in the NT would be the one most instrumental in trashing the largest and most 
important disputed passage in the NT—but this is precisely what they did.

Mark
*[B]they just couldn’t believe it…Lit: but they doubted. This is partly a figure of speech and partly true; they 
didn’t actually doubt that Jesus was there, but it’s like we say when we unexpectedly meet a friend 
somewhere whom you haven’t seen in a long time, “I still can’t believe that you’re here,” or, “I just can’t 
believe I’m talking to you after all of these years.” You know that they’re there, but the unexpectedness 
of it all has left you in a somewhat bewildered, excited state. On the other hand, they didn’t know what 
or if they should even believe it at all, as further detail is revealed in Luke 24:41–43.


The Gospel of Mark
       According to church tradition, Mark is the one referred to as John-Mark, son of Mary, in Acts 
15:37, to whose house Peter went after the angel freed him from the prison in Jerusalem. John-Mark is 
also the cousin of Barnabas. Some believe that his mother Mary is the one who furnished the upper 
room used for the Last Supper and also used on the day of Pentecost. Some believe that the “young 
man” whom Mark refers to in Mark 14:51,52 is none other than himself, corroborating the theories. But 
most agree that the “Mark my son” whom Peter refers to in 1 Pet. 5:13 is the same John-Mark and is the 
author of the Gospel of Mark.
       Mark was not actually Peter’s son, but he was a close enough companion and brother that Peter 
claims him as his figurative son, not only a son in the faith but a son in relation. Church tradition says 
that Mark was Peter’s interpreter, likely interpreting Aramaic into Greek as Peter itinerated throughout 
the Roman Empire. Serving as Peter’s interpreter, Mark would re-tell the same stories over and over 
again. He also spent a lot of time with Peter, everything from travelling to dining. No doubt, Mark spoke 
to Peter a lot and asked many questions about the missing details of the life of Jesus.
       Also according to church tradition, Peter was martyred in Rome. Mark was there at that time, 
and the brethren asked him to commit all of what Peter had told him over the years to a book. This book 
is the Gospel of Mark. Mark’s gospel is written to a Roman audience, so it does not dwell on things that 
would be interesting to a Jewish believer of the day who believed in the Messiah. Mark’s gospel is full of 
drama, action, encounters, confrontation. The teachings it contains are more down-to-earth than 
Matthew or Luke, though they are wrapped in analogy (parable) as Jesus taught them.
       Mark’s Greek is simple. He does not have the command of the language that Luke and Paul do, 
and his Gospel makes repeated use of simple words rather than drawing on less common, more specific 
words. There’s rich detail in the description of characters that looks like it came straight from the mouth 
of Peter. It vividly paints a familiarity with the character. For example, the story of the woman with the 
hemorrhage, which begins in Mark 5:25. The details give us a clear picture of this woman’s ordeal:
       A woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, having suffered a great deal at the 
hands of many doctors, spending everything she had—and nothing was helping but instead 
things were trending more to the worse…
       The details about the length of her affliction and how she had spent everything she had trying to 
find a cure leaves a stronger impression than if Mark had simply wrote, “there was a woman who had a 
really bad hemorrhage…”
       Another example comes from the story of Herod and John the Baptist. Herod kept John locked 
up in jail, and with detail Mark supplies about Herod (Mark 6:19,20), one acquires a familiarity with 
Herod:
       So Herodias maintained a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and wasn’t 
yet able to do so, since, throughout, Herod had a reverential awe of John, knowing him to be an 
upstanding man, right in the eyes of God and holy, and was keeping him safe. After listening to 
him many times, he became conflicted, yet still enjoyed listening to him.
       …the story continues after Herod’s stepdaughter finishes her dance. The silly girl “rejoined the 
party with hasty eagerness”; one can feel the glee coursing through her cruel, juvenile head.
       He swore up and down to her multiple times, “Whatever you ask me for, I’ll give it to 
you—anything you want—anything at all.” She excused herself and said to her mother, “What 
should I ask for?” Her mother said, “John the Baptist’s head.” Straightaway she rejoined the 
party and with hasty eagerness said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a 
platter—right now.”
       On the other hand, Mark is loud, clumsy, and careless as a writer, in spite of apparently having a 
scribe work with him to proof-read his Greek and to translate words for obscure objects and the like. In 
spite of his simple use of Greek, the translator must pause and think what Mark meant to say. He over-
uses the imperfect and present subjunctive tenses for effect. He uses and when he should use or and 
vice-versa (ex: Mark 11:28). He gets some simple events out of sequence, like Mark 12:8, where it 
literally reads, “They took him, killed him, and drove him outside of the vineyard.” As correlated with 
Matt. 21:39, he means, “They took him, drove him some place outside of the vineyard, and killed him 
there.” In other words, they first drove him out of the vineyard then killed him, not the other way 
around.
       Modern criticism asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel first, then it became the basis for Matthew 
and Luke. The critics are quick to dismiss reports from early church witnesses who contradict this theory, 
and are slow to propose theories of how the commonality could have come about.
       Another point of contention is the ending of Mark’s gospel, Mark 16:9–20. A footnote in a 
contemporary translation such as the NASB states that this ending is missing from two of the oldest 
manuscripts. Modern critics claim that the ending of Mark has been lost for all time, seizing upon this in 
their eagerness to poke holes in the integrity of the Scriptures. We do not have the detail of information 
we would like to solve this mystery, however there are enough fragments scattered over time to 
postulate a likely scenario. This is analogous to how the NTSB determines causes of crashes in smaller 
aircraft: they sift through the evidence and eliminate possibilities until they’re left with the “likely” 
cause of the crash. They cannot say with absolute certainty what caused the crash, but they can state 
with confidence what likely caused the accident.
       In this train of thought, the mystery of the ending of Mark is likely explained in this way: the 
ending was intentionally truncated from certain manuscripts in the late third or early fourth centuries by 
order of one in authority, perhaps even Eusebius of Caesarea himself. The reason this person did so was 
because he refused to believe what was written in Mark 16:16-19. Ironically, these manuscripts, which 
are called the Alexandrian text-type, are the most accurate in most every other respect to the originals, 
as the editors who produced them made a concerted effort to eradicate the false emendations (mostly 
insertions) which had accumulated over time in manuscripts everywhere, most likely in the second and 
third centuries, and they predate any false changes made in the fourth century and onwards. To a large 
extent, scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries, observing the faithfulness and accuracy of the hand of 
correction which guided the Alexandrian manuscripts, could not fathom that the same party who had 
corrected so many verses in the NT would be the one most instrumental in trashing the largest and most 
important disputed passage in the NT—but this is precisely what they did.

Mark
20|instructing[d] 
them to observe every last bit of what I commanded you to do. And—get this—I 
personally will be with you[e] each and every day until this present era is all wrapped 
up[f].”


&MARK 1
1|The Beginning of the Good News[a] of Jesus Christ, Son of 
God

2|…Just as it had been written by the Prophet Isaiah:

      See here—I will send my messenger
      To where your attention is fixated[b],
      Who’ll prepare your way

          
3|The sound of shouting in the countryside[d]:
“Block off the road the Lord will take!
      Barricade the streets he’ll be on!”[c]

          
4|John the Baptist came on the scene in the countryside[d] preaching a 
baptism—a water immersion-type of initiation ceremony—signifying a total 
commitment to a change in conduct to live the right way and signifying an initiation into 
a forgiveness of sins.[e] 
5|All[f] of the Judean region and everyone in Jerusalem were 
coming out and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, one after another, 
while pouring their hearts out in confessing their sins out loud. 
6|John dressed 
himself in a camel hair outfit wrapped in a leather belt and for food ate grasshoppers 
and wild honey.[g] 
7|He preached, “One’s coming after me who’s greater than me, for 
whom I’m not worthy of bending over and unfastening one of the straps on his sandals. 

8|Me—I baptize in water, but he—he’ll baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”
          
9|Jesus of Nazareth, Galilee came on the scene in those days and was baptized 
by John. 
10|As he came straight up out of the water, he saw the sky parting and the 
Spirit descending upon him like a dove.[A] 
11|A voice spoke from out of the sky, 
“You are my Beloved Son. I’m quite pleased with you.”
          
12|Immediately the Spirit drove him into the countryside[d]. 
13|He was 
out there in the middle of nowhere[d] for forty days, being tempted[B] by Satan. He was 
fighting for his life,[C] and all the while the angels were attending to him.
          
14|After John had been taken into custody, Jesus came to Galilee preaching 
God’s message of good news[h], 
15|and saying that the time had arrived[i] and that 
God’s involvement with you (God’s kingdom) had drawn near; and saying, “Go about 
changing your ways[j] and believing in the Good News[h].”
          
16|While passing by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother 
Andrew casting a net[k], seeing that they were fishermen. 
17|Jesus said to them, 
“Come be my followers, and I’ll make you into fishermen who fish for men.” 

18|Right away they left their nets and followed him. 
19|He continued 
onwards a bit further and saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, while they 
were in the boat mending the nets. 
20|Right away he called out to them, and they 
left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired hands and departed to be his 
followers.
          
21|They came to Capernaum, and without delay he started teaching in the 
synagogue there on the Sabbaths. 
22|They were amazed at his teaching, since he 
was teaching in a captivating manner[l], and not like their designated teachers, the 
Scribes. 
23|In an instant, there was a man right there in their synagogue with a 
demonic spirit[m], and he screamed, 
24|”We have no beef with you,[n] Jesus of 
Nazareth; did you come to annihilate us? I know who you are: you’re the Holy One of 
God.” 
25|Jesus sternly took charge over him saying, “Shut up and come out of 
him!” 
26|The demonic spirit[m] shook him real good, cried out in a loud voice, and 
then exited him. 
27|Everyone was amazed, to the extent that they began to discuss 
and argue among themselves, “Just who is this guy?…Fresh teaching delivered in a 
captivating manner…He even takes charge over demonic spirits, and they obey him.” 

28|Immediately, the news about him spread to everyone in the entire area 
surrounding Galilee.
          
29|Right after leaving the synagogue, they went with James and John to 
Simon and Andrew’s house. 
30|Simon’s mother-in-law was laid out with a fever, 
and immediately they spoke to Jesus about her. 
31|He went over to her, took her 
hand, pulled her up, and the fever left, and she began to attend to their needs. 

32|When it was late in the day and the sun was setting, they began to bring him all 
those having something wrong with them[o] and the demon-possessed. 
33|The 
whole city gathered at the door, 
34|and he healed many of those who had 
something wrong with them consisting of a disease of one kind or another, and cast out 
many demons, and while casting them out wasn’t letting the demons say anything, 
because they knew who he was.
          
35|Early in the morning, before daybreak, he left and went out to a place 
where nobody was around and prayed and prayed there. 
36|Simon and those with 
him went out to hunt him down. 
37|They found him and, engaging him in 
conversation, said, “Everyone’s looking for you.” 
38|Continuing the conversation, 
he said, “Let’s go somewhere else, to an area where there’s towns in the vicinity.” 

39|They went throughout all of Galilee preaching in the synagogues there and 
casting out demons.
          
40|A leper approached him[p], pleading with him, “If you so desire, you can 
purge this disease from me[q].” 
41|He had pity on him, extended his hand, touched 
him, and pronounces, “I do so desire; be purged of this disease.” 
42|Immediately it 
left him; he was purged of the disease. 
43|Without wasting any time, he sternly 
and with an inner indignation[r] gave him specific instructions and then cut him loose[s], 

44|telling him, “Make sure you don’t say anything to anyone about this, but go 
your way and show yourself to the priest and bring along with you the offering that the 
Old Testament[t] commands as an official submission for the certification of the purging 
of this disease.”

the Spirit like a dove descending to him. The comparison of the Spirit to a dove is misunderstood. The 
Spirit descended the same way a dove would descend, but the Spirit himself is not like a dove. Pigeons 
are similar to doves, and are birds we are more familiar with. A pigeon flutters and flaps its wings as it 
lands on a spot in the park, but once it has landed, all the flapping and fluttering immediately ceases, 
and the pigeon then begins to walk slowly looking for food. So it was when the Spirit descended: a lot of 
activity and commotion, but once the Spirit came to rest on Jesus, the commotion ceased. But like the 
pigeon, the Spirit remained.

wall, or, I was between a rock and a hard spot.

Mark
45|But he departed and began going around enthusiastically 
telling lots of people what had happened and spreading the story and its acclamation 
around, resulting in him no longer being able to enter a city, but instead having to stay 
outside in the countryside.
      And they began to come to him from every direction.


&MARK 2
1|Several days after entering Capernaum, word got out that he was staying in 
a house there. 
2|Many converged on it, to the extent that nobody could get in or out of 
the door anymore, and he kept on speaking the word of God to them. 
3|Four men 
arrived carrying a stretcher that had someone who was paralyzed on it. 
4|Not being 
able to carry him through the crowd, they pulled away the roof where he was and dug 
out a hole in order to lower the stretcher on which the paralyzed fellow was lying. 

5|Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the one paralyzed, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” 

6|Some of the designated teachers[a] were sitting there mulling this over in their 
hearts, 
7|”How can he talk that way to this guy? He’s blaspheming; who’s able to 
forgive sins, except for the one-and-only God?” 
8|Immediately coming to the 
realization in his spirit exactly what they had thought up, Jesus engages them in 
conversation, “Why did you, inside of yourselves, think these things up? 
9|What’s 
easier to say to the one paralyzed, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or, ‘Get up, take your 
stretcher, and walk around’? 
10|But so that you would know that the Man[b] has 
the authority on earth to forgive sins…” he turns and speaks to the paralyzed fellow, 

11|”…I say to you, pick up your stretcher and go on home.” 
12|And in front 
of everybody he got up, without delay picked up his stretcher, and left, to everyone’s 
amazement and to their glorification of God saying, “We’ve never seen anything like 
this before.”
          
13|Again, he ventured out near the sea. Everyone in the crowd started 
coming to him, and he began teaching them. 
14|As he was passing through, he saw 
Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the customs table[A], and tells him directly, “Be my 
follower.[c]” And he got up and became his follower. 
15|As he sat down to dine[B] at 
home, many tax collectors and other sinners gathered there to eat with Jesus. 

16|The designated teachers, the ones affiliated with the Pharisees, observing that 
he takes meals with sinners and tax collectors, were saying to his disciples, “How is it 
that he dines with the tax collectors and other sinners?” 
17|Jesus heard this and said 
to them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor, but those who have something wrong 
with them do. I didn’t come to call on those right with God but rather on sinners.”
          
18|John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they approached him 
with a question, “What’s the reason that John’s disciples fast and the Pharisees’ 
disciples fast, but your disciples don’t fast?” 
19|Jesus said, “The groom’s cronies 
can’t fast when the groom’s around, can they? As long as the groom is with them, 
they’re not able to fast. 
20|But there’ll come a day[d] when the groom is taken away, 
and that’s the day they’ll start fasting.” 
21|No one uses a patch made from new 
material to patch an old garment with; otherwise, the new material will wind up tearing 
itself away from the old, and a worse gap will appear. 
22|And no one puts freshly-
squeezed grape juice[C] into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will cause the skins to 
burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Rather, grape juice goes into new 
wine skins.”
          
23|He happened to be passing through the grain fields on days which were 
Sabbath days, and his disciples began to make their way through the fields stripping 
the grain off the heads of the stalks[D]. 
24|The Pharisees proceeded to say to him, 
“Take a look—they’re doing what’s forbidden on the Sabbath.” 
25|Looking deeper 
at the situation, he said to them, “Didn’t you read about what David did when the need 
arose and he got hungry[e]—and so did those who were with him? 
26|How, when 
Abiathar was high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the holy bread[E], which 
no one’s allowed to eat except the priests, and—not only that—he passed it out to those 
who were with him?” 
27|He summarized, “The Sabbath came into being for the 
benefit of mankind, and not mankind for the benefit of the Sabbath, 
*[a]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[b]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note in Matt. 8:20.
*[c]Be my follower…Lit: follow me
*[d]But there’ll come a day…Lit: But days will come
*[e]he got hungry…Impl: he got hungry by his own right, or, he got hungry by his own doing

*[A]customs table…Also: custom house, revenue office, or tax office. Nowadays, we visit places like tag 
agencies or license plate offices. The concept is similar, the details vastly different, of course.
*[B]sat down to dine…Lit: And he happens to recline at his house. They reclined to partake of the meal, 
taking their time at it and enjoying the company of those dining them. Also, the GT insinuates that, once 
the sinners heard that Jesus had reclined for a meal, they came and joined him at the meal.
*[C]freshly-squeezed grape juice…Lit: new wine. The Gk. word for wine means either grape juice (no 
preservatives, of course) or wine. The distinction in ancient times is that grape juice is simply wine which 
hasn’t fermented yet; freshly-squeezed grape juice will invariably ferment into wine (or vinegar if not 
done properly). The fermentation of the juice into wine yields gases, and since the skins are sealed shut, 
such gases cause an increase in pressure, which causes a new skin to stretch, and therefore the total 
volume in the sealed container to increase, thereby reducing the pressure. Old skins, those which have 
been used once already for making wine, have been stretched fully and do not shrink after the wine has 
been poured out of them. When grape juice is fermented in them a second time, since they have 
already been stretched to their maximum extent, and are not capable of stretching any more, the 
pressure buildup from the second fermentation cannot be relieved and causes the skins to burst.
*[D]stripping the grain off the heads of the stalks…Walking through the fields and eating the heads of 
wheat, barley, etc.; this is permitted under OT law (ref. Lev. 19:9-10, Deut. 24:19-21, and others).
[E]holy bread…The holy bread here is the showbread. This is bread which was placed on a table and was 
always present in the Temple in Jerusalem, as required by the OT (ref. Exod. 25:30, Matt. 12:4).

being that the Man is also master over the Sabbath.”


&MARK 3
1|Yet again he introduced himself to those in the synagogue and attended a 
meeting[a]. There was a man there with a shriveled-up[b] hand, 
2|and they were 
watching him closely, to see if he was going to heal him on the Sabbath, so that they’d 
have something to accuse him of. 
3|He addressed the man with the shriveled-up 
hand, “Get up and stand front and center.” 
4|He challenged them, “Is it permissible on 
the Sabbath to do a good deed or to do bad, to save someone’s life or to kill someone?” 
They remained silent. 
5|He looked all around, staring at them in fury, being deeply 
grieved over the callousness of their hearts, and said to the man intently, “Stretch your 
hand out.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 
6|After the Pharisees 
departed, they wasted no time in meeting with the Herodians about him, to figure out 
how they could kill him.
          
7|Jesus, accompanied by his disciples, ventured over to the sea, and a great 
many followed him from Galilee, and from Judea, 
8|and from Jerusalem, and from 
Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River, and from the areas around Tyre and 
Sidon—a great many, hearing about how much he was doing, went to him. 
9|And 
because of the crowd, he spoke to his disciples about getting a boat, so that they 
wouldn’t press in on him. 
10|Indeed, he treated many, resulting in them mobbing 
him[c] in order that they might receive a touch from him, whoever was getting the tar 
beaten out of him by disease or whatnot[d]. 
11|And, time and time again, the 
demonic spirits[e], when they saw him, prostrated themselves before him in homage and 
screamed out, “You are the Son of God!” 
12|And, time and time again, he was 
sternly silencing them so they would not cause him to be plainly known as such.
          
13|He hiked up a mountain and summoned those whom he had been 
wanting to have as his disciples, and they came to him. 
14|He made twelve[A], and he 
made them so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach 
his message 
15|and to have authority to cast out demons[B]. 
16|[A]He assigned 
the name “Peter[C]” to Simon, 
17|and there was James son of Zebedee and his 
brother John, to whom he assigned the name “Sons of Thunder[f],” 
18|Andrew, 
Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the 
Canaaanite (i.e., Zealot), 
19|and Judas Iscariot, his betrayer.
          
20|Now he came to a house. Once again, the crowd converged on it, 
resulting in them not being able to get a bite[g] to eat. 
21|When the neighbors[h] 
caught wind of this, they came out to get him under control[i], since they had been 
saying all along that he’s lost his mind. 
22|And the designated teachers, the Scribes, 
made the journey from Jerusalem and had been saying that he’s possessed by the Chief 
Demon[j] himself, and that, by means of the chief, he casts out the underling-demons. 

23|He called them over and began to teach them by using analogies[k]: “How can 
one demon cast out another demon[l]? 
24|If a kingdom is divided into parts which 
are pitted against each other[l], that kingdom will fall apart. 
25|And if an 
organization is divided into parts which are pitted against each other[m], that organization 
will fall apart. 
26|And if Satan has one demon oppose another demon, and they 
split into hostile factions, his kingdom will fall apart—and that’s the end of that[n]. 

27|More to the point—no one can enter the tough guy’s house, unless he first 
subdues the tough guy.[D] 
28|I tell you for sure, that ornery folk[o] will be forgiven 
of anything and of the random blasphemies that they blurt out[p], 
29|but if anyone 
were to blaspheme the Holy Spirit[E], he won’t ever be forgiven—he’s guilty of an 
eternal sin.” 
30|He said all this because they were going about saying, “He has a 
demonic spirit[d].”
          
31|His mother and brothers came and were standing outside and sent him 
word, calling on him. 
32|Seated around him was a crowd, and they said to him, 
“Hey, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.” 

33|Surprisingly, he replied, “Who is my mother and my brothers?” 
34|He 
looked around at those sitting in a circle around him and said, “Take a look here—my 
mother and my brothers.” 
*[a]he introduced himself to those in the synagogue and attended a meeting…Lit: he entered into a 
synagogue. Ref. note of Acts 19:8.
*[b]shriveled-up hand…Ref. note of Matt. 12:10
*[c]mobbing him…Lit: falling upon him
*[d]Getting the tar beaten out of them or whatnot…Lit: being flogged. This word means a scourge, a 
plague, a judgment (perceived at least) from God.
*[e]demonic spirit(s)…Lit: unclean spirit(s)
*[f]Sons of Thunder…means those having a thunderous nature
*[g]bite…Lit: bread
*[h]neighbors…Lit: those with him. Surmising that “those with him” are his neighbors, since it says later in 
v. 21 that they came out: assuming that this means they were not in the same house Jesus was in. Some, 
however, think that “those with him” refers to Jesus’s family members.
*[i]get him under control…Lit: to seize him
*[j]Chief Demon…Lit: Beelzebub. The ancient Jews believed he was the ruler of the demons.
*[k]analogies…Lit: parables
*[l]How can one demon cast out another demon?…Lit: How can Satan cast out Satan? The demons under 
Satan at times go by the name of Satan himself, as they do his bidding.
*[m]is divided into parts pitted against each other…Lit: is divided upon itself
*[n]and that’s the end of that…Lit: but instead has an end.
*[o]ornery folk…Lit: sons of men
*[p]random blasphemies that they blurt out…Lit: …and the blasphemies which they might blaspheme. The 
wording is a figure of speech.

*[A]He made twelve…Some manuscripts include the phrase, whom he also called “the sent ones” (i.e. 
apostles) in v. 14 and the phrase, And he made the twelve, in v. 16, but there is not strong evidence 
whether this is genuine or not. The assumption is that it is not genuine.
*[B]demons…Lit: the demons. In classical Gk., this phrase meant divine visitations, and referred to special 
talents or powers that select folks had, and also came to mean an inferior race of divine beings. As this 
evolved in time, it is used in the NT to refer to an evil race of divine beings. This is the meaning Mark 
selected to use here, by choosing the phrase the demons, which is not used much in the NT, instead of 
the usual phrase unclean spirits. Mark emphasizes that these evil spirits are an entire supernatural race 
of a sort. The phrase unclean spirit emphasizes the vile, unnatural, and evil nature of these beings; the 
phrase the demons emphasizes that these beings are a supernatural race.
*[C]Peter…The name comes from a Gk. word means rock. Jesus is not only assigning him this name but 
declaring that Simon has the characteristics of this new name. Although many interpret rock to mean 
stability, the meaning of rock as revealed in the NT (ref. Matt 16:18, Eph. 2:20) is a foundation to build 
upon, which specifically points to a foundational leadership position in the Church. This list of apostles 
here in Mark 3 ranks them according to the preeminence Jesus assigns to them. Therefore, in listing 
Peter first and giving him the name Peter (”the rock”), Jesus has made Peter the first among his disciples 
and the one who’ll lead the early church after his ascension.
*[D]No one can enter the strong man’s house unless he first binds the tough guy…Jesus stated this in the 
context of the way Satan and his demons operate. This verse is one of the most important rules for 
understanding how demons take hold of people. What Jesus is saying is that it is not possible for 
demons to simply approach someone and take control of them, believers and unbelievers alike. In order 
for evil spirits to get any sort of control over a person, they must break that person’s will first. Breaking 
their will is “binding the strong man.” Only then, can they “enter the strong man’s house.” A person who 
is fully demon-possessed has had his willpower systematically broken, and for this reason, someone 
must cast the demon out of him, since he has not the willpower to do it himself. However, any believer 
can simply exercise his will and authority in Christ and drive any demonic influence from himself.
[E]blaspheme the Holy Spirit…Jesus says that this one sin called “the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit” is 
unforgiveable. Jesus spoke of the same thing in Matt. 12:32 (ref. note there). What exactly, then, is the 
blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? The answer is in plain sight, as Jesus was insinuating that the Scribes had 
committed this sin, and what the Scribes did is specified in v.30. Here the Scribes could see the miracles 
of Jesus, and they attributed them to the devil. Believing in miracles does not require the amount of 
faith as believing in something which is unseen does. The hardness of heart that denies the undeniable 
will never turn to God and will therefore never receive forgiveness, ever.

&MARK 4
1|On another occasion, he began to teach near the sea. A huge crowd gathered 
around him, causing him to have to get in a boat and sit out in the sea; everyone in the 
crowd stayed on dry land and squeezed in as close as they could to the shoreline. 
2|He 
began to teach them by means of analogy[a], telling many. In one of his sermons he was 
telling them this: 
3|”Listen up! There was once a farmer who went out to sow. 

4|While sowing, some of the seed happened to fall up and down the pathway, and 
the birds came and ate it all up, 
5|while some of the other seed fell on the rocky 
ground, where there wasn’t much soil, and, because the soil there wasn’t deep, it 
immediately germinated, 
6|and when the sun rose, it was scorched, and it dried up 
due to it not having established deep roots. 
7|Yet other fell in the place where there 
were weeds, and the weeds sprung up, engulfed it, and choked it, and it didn’t yield 
any produce. 
8|Nevertheless, though, some seed fell on the good ground and, 
springing up and growing, yielded produce: some yielding 30-to-1, and some 60-to-1, 
and some 100-to-1.” 
9|And he kept telling them, “A word to the wise is sufficient.[A]”
          
10|When they got together by themselves, those around him, along with the 
Twelve, asked him about the analogies. 
11|He began by saying, “The mystery of 
God’s Involvement with Mankind (God’s kingdom) is given to you, but to those on the 
outside (i.e. those who are not a part of God’s kingdom), all these things are just analogies, 

12|so that,

“While looking, they may look and not see
(i.e., they’re aware of it, but they don’t get it),
And while hearing, they may hear and not comprehend
(i.e., it goes in one ear and out the next),
Lest they were to turn to it and be forgiven”

          
13|He said, “Don’t you get this analogy? How then will you comprehend all 
the analogies? 
14|The sower sows the word. 
15|The ones where the word is 
sown up and down the pathway—when these people hear the word, immediately Satan 
comes and takes away the word which had been sown in their hearts. 
16|The ones 
where the word is sown on the rocky ground—when these people hear the word, they 
immediately receive it with joy, 
17|and not having established roots, their joy is but 
temporary, for a timespan, a brief passing chapter in life; and then when persecution or 
the pressures of distress happen on account of the word, they immediately fall apart[b]. 

18|Still there are others, where the word is sown among the weeds—these are the 
ones that have heard the word, 
19|and the never-ending worries and anxieties, the 
self-delusion[c] of wealth, and those things which go hand-in-hand[d] with the cravings 
which still linger in your mind, as they enter in to your heart, engulf the word and choke 
it, and it won’t yield any produce. 
20|The ones where the word is sown upon the 
good ground—now those are the ones who hear the word, take hold of it, and yield 
produce, some at 30-to-1, some at 60-to-1, some at 100-to-1.”
          
21|He proceeded to tell them, “The house lamp is not brought out to be put 
under the bread basket or under the couch, is it? Is it not brought out to be placed on the 
lampstand? 
22|Indeed, there is nothing hidden but that it would manifest itself, nor 
has there been anything purposely hidden away but that it would come into 
manifestation. 
23|A word to the wise is sufficient.”
          
24|He proceeded to tell them, “Monitor[e] what you hear. The quantity 
which you deem sufficient is the quantity which will be deemed sufficient for you.[f] 

25|For he who has, it will be given to him; and he who does not have, even that 
which he has will be taken away from him.”
          
26|He proceeded to tell them, “This is the way God’s involvement with 
mankind (God’s kingdom) is: it’s like a man who goes and casts seed upon the ground 

27|and goes to bed and gets up over and over again, day after day and night after 
night, and the seed sprouts and gets taller—just how, he has no idea. 
28|The 
ground in and of itself brings forth the crop, starting first with the blade, then the grain 
head, then the mature head. 
29|Now when the crop reaches full maturity, right 
away he sends for the sickle[B], because the harvest has arrived.”
          
30|He proceeded to tell them, “How do I draw up a comparison to God’s 
involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom)? Or, in what analogy should it be 
presented? 
31|It’s like a mustard seed, which, when sown, is about the smallest 
seed you’ll find, 
32|and, when sown, pops up and becomes the biggest crop-
yielding plant you’ll find and forms huge branches, so much so that the birds of the sky 
can nest in its shade.”
          
33|He kept speaking the word of God to them by means of many analogies 
such as these, doing it to the degree that they continued to be able to make sense of 
what he was saying. 
34|And, apart from analogies, he wasn’t telling them 
anything. But he explained everything to his own disciples when they were by 
themselves.
          
35|When it got to be late in the day, he prompted them, “Let’s cut across to 
the other side.” 
36|After dismissing the crowd they joined up with him as he was 
already in the boat they planned to use. Other boats were alongside it. 
37|A 
windstorm appeared, and the waves kept crashing on the boat, enough to fill it. 

38|He, though, was in the stern sleeping on the cushions. They woke him and 
sought to engage him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re dying here?” 
39|And he 
got up and sternly silenced the wind and said to the sea, “Quiet—stifle it!” And the 
wind died down and a great calm appeared. 
40|He said to them, “What a bunch of 
chickens you all are. You still don’t have any faith, do you?” 
*[a]analogy…Lit: parable(s)
*[b]fall apart…Also: get tripped up; get offended; fall into sin; fall prey to a trap
*[c]self-delusion…Lit: deceitfulness. Note that the root of deceitfulness (ἀπάτη/Strong’s 539) is the Gk. 
verb apataō (ἀπατάω/Strong’s 538) in the active voice means to deceive and mislead but in the middle 
voice means to “enjoy oneself, live pleasurably” (Danker & Bauer). In this context here in Mark, the 
noun form acquires some of insinuations of the middle voice. Combined, it means the self-delusion 
brought on by living a life of pleasure.
*[d]hand-in-hand…Lit: around or surround
*[e]Monitor…Lit: watch; look at; see
*[f]The quantity which you deem sufficient is the quantity which will be deemed sufficient for you…Lit: By 
the measure that you’re measuring, it will be measured to you and will be added to you
*[g]they were dumbfounded with awe and reverence…Lit: they feared a great fear. A figure of speech.

*[A]A word to the wise is sufficient…Lit: whoever has an ear to be hearing, let him be hearing. Ref. note of 
Matt. 11:15.
[B]he sends for the sickle…A textbook-example of a figure of speech. The man does not command that a 
sickle come (sickles are inanimate), but the worker (or more likely, a several workers) who swings the 
sickle to come. The definite article the used in the sickle is a key indicator that this is a figure of speech.

&MARK 5
1|He got to the other side of the sea, to the Gerasenes region. 
2|Right away, 
while he was still getting out of the boat, from out of the tombs a man having a demonic 
spirit accosted him, 
3|who lived there in the tombs. No one had the ability to chain 
him up anymore,[A] 
4|on account of him, many times, having his arms secured in 
chains and his feet in stocks and breaking out of the chains and stocks after shredding 
them to pieces—no one was powerful enough to restrain him. 
5|Day and night he was 
up in the tombs and in the mountains screaming and cutting himself up with stones. 

6|Seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and prostrated himself before him 
7|and 
yelled in a loud voice, “I have no beef with you,[a] Jesus, son of the Highest God! In 
God’s name I’m begging you—don’t torment me![b]” 
8|…since he was about to say to 
him, “Come out of him, you foul spirit!” 
9|He asked him, “What’s your name?” He 
replied, “My name’s ‘Regiment’[B], since there’s a lot of us.” 
10|He was pleading 
with him a good deal, so that he wouldn’t send them outside the region. 
11|Now, 
there was a huge herd of pigs feeding there at the mountain. 
12|They begged him, 
“Send us over to the pigs, so that we can enter them.” 
13|He permitted them, and 
the regiment of foul spirits departed and entered the pigs, and the herd bolted over the 
cliff and into the sea—about two thousand of them—and drowned in the sea.
          
14|Those feeding them proceeded to run away, and they told everyone in 
the city and in the countryside, and they came to see what happened. 
15|They 
went to where Jesus was and observed the demon-possessed man sitting, clothed, and in 
a sound state of mind—the one who had the regiment—and they got scared. 

16|They described to those who came to look around what happened to the demon-
possessed man and about the pigs. 
17|They began to plead with him to leave their 
mountains. 
18|While he was boarding the boat, the demon-possessed man asked if 
he could be with him from then on, 
19|but he didn’t allow it, but instead instructed 
him, “Go on back home, to your own folk, and let them know what the Lord has done 
for you, the mercy He has had on you.” 
20|He left and began to preach what Jesus 
did for him[c] in Decapolis, and everyone was in awe.
          
21|Again, Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side, and a large crowd 
converged on him, while he was still near the sea. 
22|One of the synagogue leaders 
named Jairus came, and, seeing him, fell at his feet 
23|and went to pleading with 
him a great deal, saying, “My baby’s[d] at death’s door[e],” in order that he would come 
and put his hand on her, so that she would be spared and would live. 
24|He left 
with him, and a huge crowd began to follow him and was constantly pressing in on 
him.
          
25|A woman who had a hemorrhage[C] for twelve years, 
26|having 
suffered a great deal at the hands of many doctors, spending everything she had—and 
nothing was helping but instead things were trending more to the worse— 
27|heard 
about Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer cloak, 

28|since she kept on saying to herself, “If I were to just touch his cloak, I‘ll pull 
through[f].” 
29|Her hemorrhage[C] stopped immediately, and her body told her[g] 
that she had been healed from this calamity of illness. 
30|Right away Jesus, having 
discerned in himself that miraculous power had proceeded out of him, turned to the 
crowd and said repeatedly, “Who touched my garment?” 
31|The disciples 
proceeded to say, “You see the crowd pressing in on you and you’re asking, ‘Who 
touched me?’” 
32|He looked around to see who did this. 
33|Now the woman, 
scared and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell before him 
and told him the whole truth. 
34|He said to her, “Ma’am[h], your faith has pulled 
you through. Carry on in peace (i.e., go your way free of conflict, duress, or affliction) and be 
recuperated entirely[i] from your calamity of illness.”
          
35|While he was yet still talking, someone from the synagogue leader’s 
household arrived saying, “Your daughter’s dead; no need for you to bother the teacher 
anymore.” 
36|Now Jesus, having listened in to the report as it was being spoken, 
addresses the synagogue ruler, “Don’t be afraid—just believe.” 
37|He wouldn’t let 
anyone accompany him, except for Peter, James, and his brother John. 
38|He came 
to the synagogue leader’s house, and he sees commotion, weeping, and much 
lamentation, 
39|and he entered and gaining their attention said, “What’s the 
commotion about and why all the crying?” 
40|They began to ridicule him. He, 
though, threw everyone out and took the child’s mother and father and those with him 
and went in to where the child was. 
41|He took the child’s hand and said to her, 
“Talitha koum!” which translated means, “Young lady, I’m speaking to you: get up!” 

42|Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around, since she was twelve 
years old. Immediately, out of enormous delight, they lost it[j]. 
*[a]I have no beef with you…Lit: what to me and to you. Same expression used in Matt. 8:29, Mark 1:24, 
John 2:4. Ref. note of Matt. 8:29
*[b]I’m begging you—don’t torment me…Lit: I adjure you by God—you would not torment me
*[c]did for him…Lit: did to him
*[d]baby…The GT uses the diminutive form of daughter, which can be translated: baby; baby girl; darling 
daughter; little darling; dear girl; sweet daughter; little girl; precious little daughter; cute little daughter
*[e]at death’s door…Lit: is lastly having
*[f]I’ll pull through…Lit: I will be saved. In general means: rescued; delivered; kept from catastrophe; 
having one’s life saved; In this context, means: rescued from the living hell of this illness.
*[g]her body told her…Lit: [she] knew in body
*[h]Ma’am…Lit: daughter. Possibly short for daughter of Israel or, daughter of Zion. Similarly, daughter of 
Jerusalem. Refers to respectable women.
*[i]recuperated entirely…Lit: whole
*[j]they lost it…Lit: they were ecstatic in a great ecstasy. Repetition of ecstasy here is a figure of speech. 
This is the same type of figure of speech used in Matt. 2:10.

*[A]no one had the ability to chain him up anymore…Lit (Gk. text): oude halusei ouketi oudeis  [which is 
οὐδὲ ἁλύσει οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς, (οὐδὲ /Strong’s 3761), (ἁλύσει /Strong’s 254), (οὐκέτι /Strong’s 3765), 
(οὐδεὶς /Strong’s 3762)], translated lit., neither in chains no longer no one. The close repetition of three 
similar sounding words, together with the verb tense for able, is an alliteration or assonance. The figure 
of speech used here paints a picture of multiple men or parties of men making multiple attempts to 
chain him up, succeeding the first time but failing every time after, but still giving it a go from time to 
time. This is spelled out in v. 4.
*[B]Regiment…Lit: Legion. A roman legion was about 4,000 soldiers, closer in size to a modern brigade 
than a regiment, actually, but being similar as a functional unit.
[C]A woman who had a hemorrhage…hemorrhage …Lit., in v. 25: a woman being in a flow of blood twelve 
years; and lit., in v. 29: her flow of blood dried up. From the literal descriptions, it sounds like the woman 
suffered from abnormal uterine bleeding. This is entirely speculation, of course.

&MARK 6
1|He departed from there and came to his hometown[a], and his disciples 
followed him. 
2|On a Saturday, the Sabbath, he began to teach in the synagogue, and 
many of the listeners were amazed saying, “Where did he get these things from, and 
who bestowed the wisdom on him, and who gave his hands the ability to perform such 
miracles as these? 
3|Isn’t this fellow the craftsman[b], Mary’s son and James, Joses, 
Juda, and Simon’s brother? Aren’t his sisters from around here?[c]” And they took 
aversion to him.[d] 
4|He was saying to them that a prophet isn’t honored[e] in his 
hometown, in his synagogues, and in his own home, 
5|and he couldn’t perform a 
single miracle there, except for healing a few ailments, by laying his hands on a few 
people. 
6|He was astonished at their refusal to believe[f].
      He went around teaching in the surrounding towns, 
7|and he summoned the 
Twelve and began to send them out in pairs, gave them authority over demonic spirits, 

8|and charged them not to take anything on the road with them except a staff only—no 
food, no backpack, no spare cash; 
9|moreover, he told them to be sure to show up 
wearing sandals and to refrain from putting on two sets of undergarments[g]. 
10|He 
continued speaking to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until it’s time to 
leave town. 
11|Whatever place won’t receive you or hear what you have to say, as 
you’re leaving that place, shake the dust off the bottom of your sandals like a key 
witness testifying in court[A].” 
12|They dispersed and preached with the goal in 
mind of having people fundamentally change the way they conduct their lives[h]. 

13|Time and time again they cast out many demons and applied soothing oil to 
many[B] people who had ailments, and one after another was being healed.[i]
          
14|Now King Herod heard the news, since his reputation was spreading. 
They were saying that John the Baptist rose from the dead, and this is the means by 
which the miracles are accomplished by him. 
15|Others were saying that he’s 
Elijah. Still others were saying that he’s a prophet like one of the prophets in the Old 
Testament. 
16|After Herod heard all of this, he started going around saying, “The 
guy I personally beheaded—John—that’s who was resurrected.”
          
17|The fact is, Herod himself had dispatched his men and had John taken 
into custody and locked him up in jail[j] on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, 
because he had married her; 
18|you see, John had been telling Herod that it’s not 
permissible[C] for him to be married to his brother’s wife. 
19|So Herodias 
maintained a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and wasn’t yet able to do 
so, 
20|since, throughout, Herod had a reverential awe[k] of John, knowing him to be 
an upstanding man, right in the eyes of God and holy, and was keeping him safe. After 
listening to him many times, he became conflicted, yet still enjoyed listening to him.
          
21|There came a day when the opportunity presented itself, when, on 
Herod’s birthday, she prepared a special dinner for his gentry, for the high-ranking 
army officers, and for the top leaders of Galilee. 
22|Herodias’s daughter entered 
and danced and pleased Herod and his fellow dinner guests. The king said to the young 
miss, “Whatever you want, ask me, and I’ll give it to you.” 
23|He swore up and 
down to her multiple times, “Whatever you ask me for, I’ll give it to you—anything you 
want—anything at all.[D]” 
24|She excused herself and said to her mother, “What 
should I ask for?” Her mother said, “John the Baptist’s head.” 
25|Straightaway she 
rejoined the party and with hasty eagerness[l] said, “I want you to give me John the 
Baptist’s head on a platter—right now.” 
26|From head to toe the king became 
deeply sorry, but because of the promises and the dinner guests didn’t want to deny her 
request. 
27|The king ordered that his head be brought in at once. They went out and 
beheaded him in jail 
28|and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young 
miss, who gave it to her mother. 
29|When his disciples heard about this, they came 
and took away his body and placed it in a tomb.
          
30|Now the disciples assembled back where Jesus was at and told him what 
they did and what they taught. 
31|He comforted them, “You and only you go to a 
place where nobody’s around and rest up a bit,” since a lot of people were coming and 
going, and they couldn’t find a moment to have a meal. 
32|So they left by 
themselves in the boat to go to a remote location. 
33|They were seen departing, 
and a lot of people figured out where they were going and came out of all the cities and, 
in one pack, ran and got there ahead of them. 
34|Departing, he saw a large crowd 
and felt sorry for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and began to 
teach them many things. 
35|Much of the day had already passed by, and the 
disciples came to him and proceeded to say,
      “We’re out in the middle of nowhere and it’s getting late. 
36|Disperse them, 
so that they can go out into the surrounding countryside and towns and buy something 
to eat.”
          
37|His response to that was, “Give them something to eat yourselves.”
      They, in turn, said, “So, now, we go out and buy $20,000[E] worth of bread and 
distribute it?”
          
38|He, in turn, said, “How much food do you have? Go take a look.”
      They counted it up and gave him the results, “Five loaves and two fishes.”
          
39|He had them find a nice spot to relax[m] where the grass was tall and had 
them break up into dinner parties. 
40|They seated themselves in lots of hundreds 
and fifties. 
41|He took the five loaves and the two fishes, looked up in the sky, 
gave thanks, broke the bread,[n] and gave it to his disciples for them to go about placing 
it within their reach. 
42|Everyone ate to their full, 
43|and there were twelve 
basketfuls of bread scraps and fish left over. 
44|There were five thousand grown 
men there eating that day.
          
45|Right away, the disciples had to get into the boat and head out before him 
to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. 
46|He took his leave 
of them and hiked up into the mountain to pray. 
47|Near sundown, the boat was 
out in the middle of the sea, while he was by himself on land. 
48|Watching them 
struggling to row, since they were up against a contrary wind, around four o’clock in 
the morning[o], he came to them walking on the water and was going to pass them by. 

49|Upon seeing him walking about on the water, they thought it was a ghost and 
shouted out loud; 
50|indeed, everyone saw him and was terrified. Immediately he 
engaged them in conversation saying, “Relax, it’s me, don’t be afraid.” 
51|He went 
over to where they were and got into the boat, and the wind died down. They were 
completely stupefied[p], 
52|since they hadn’t put all the pieces together in regard to 
the incident of the bread, and, what’s more, their hearts[q] had been hardened.
          
53|Having crossed over to land, they came to Gennesaret and docked. 

54|As they were getting out of the boat, people immediately recognized him. 

55|Everyone from that whole region there rushed around the lake to see him, and they 
proceeded to carry around the lake on cots those who had something wrong with them, 
wherever it was being reported that he was at.

56|And whatever place he were to 
enter—a town, a city, a place in the countryside—they were placing those having 
illnesses in the town square, and they were begging him if they could just touch a part of 
his clothing, and whoever were to touch a part of it would be snatched away from the 
clutches of their illness.


&MARK 7
1|The Pharisees and some of the designed teachers[a] came from Jerusalem and 
congregated around him. 
2|They were observing some of his disciples taking their 
meals with defiled[A] hands (that is, with unwashed hands), 
3|since the Pharisees and 
all the Jews won’t eat if they haven’t washed their hands up to their wrists, adhering to 
the time-honored traditions[b], 
4|and if they come from the marketplace or the town 
square, they won’t eat until they take a ceremonial bath; plus they adhere to many more 
things that have been handed down through the years…the ceremonial washing of wine 
chalices, of jugs, of utensils— 
5|and the Pharisees and designated teachers[a] asked 
him, “Why is it that your disciples aren’t in the habit of observing the time-honored 
traditions, but eat their meals with tainted hands?” 
6|He said, “Isaiah sure was right 
when he prophesied about you—the hypocrites—as it is written:

“This people honors Me with their lips
But their hearts are held at a distance from me.

7|So they worship Me to no avail
Teaching man’s commandments[c].


8|”Abandoning the commandment of God, you adhere to the tradition of men.” 

9|He kept on going, “Great job rejecting the commandment of God in order to adhere 
to your traditions. 
10|Now, the Old Testament says,[d] ‘Financially support your 
mother and father[e]’, and ‘Let he who bad-mouths his mother or father be put to 
death[f]’. 
11|But you all say, ‘That payment which I was obligated to send you has 
instead been designated as an offering to God[g]’, 
12|meaning that such a person is off 
the hook for sending funds to his mother and father. 
13|You’re disregarding the 
word of God by the tradition handed down to you. You do all sorts of things like that.”
          
14|He summoned the crowd and kept with the subject, saying, “Everyone, 
listen to me and get ahold of this. 
15|There’s nothing outside of a person which, by 
going into him, can defile him; but rather those things which proceed out of a person 
are what defiles the person.” 
16|[B]
          
17|When he entered a house, away from the crowd, his disciples started 
asking him about the illustration[h]. 
18|He said to them, “You don’t get it either? 
Don’t you know that everything on the outside which goes into a person can’t defile 
him, 
19|because it doesn’t go into his heart, but instead goes into his intestines, and 
then leaves him going into the toilet (thereby declaring that, henceforth, you’re allowed to 
eat any kind of food[C])?” 
20|He continued on saying, “The stuff which proceeds 
out of a person—that’s what defiles the person. 
21|Indeed, from within a person’s 
heart comes out of it the conniving[i] common to mankind…sexual immorality[j], thievery, 
murder, 
22|adultery, greed, utter corruption[k], intentional misleading[l], strong out-
of-control desire[m], evil trains of thought[n], blasphemy or bad-mouthing, arrogance[o], 
reckless stupidity[p]. 
23|All of these inner evils proceed to the outside and defile a 
person.”
          
24|He wrapped things up there and left for the region of Tyre. He entered a 
house, since he wasn’t wanting to have direct contact with anyone. 
25|But instead, 
without delay a woman who had a daughter who was overcome with having a demonic 
spirit heard about him and came and fell at his feet. 
26|But the woman was a non-
Jew[q], a Syro-Phoenician by nationality. She drove home her point asking him if he’d cast 
the demon out of his daughter. 
27|And he drove home his point saying to her,
      “Let the children eat until they’re full first, since it wouldn’t be right to take the 
children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.[D]”
          
28|But after some thought she replied, “Lord, even the dogs groveling under 
the table are fed from the children’s crumbs.”
          
29|He said to her, “On account of this statement, go your way: the demon 
has gone out of your daughter, for good.”
          
30|After arriving back home, she found the child bedfast and the demon 
gone for good.
          
31|Again, he left Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, to the 
central area of Decapolis. 
32|They brought him a man who was deaf and who 
could barely speak, and they asked him to lay his hand on him. 
33|He took him 
aside, in order to be away from the crowd and to have some privacy, and he stuck his 
fingers in his ears, and, after he spat, touched all around his tongue. 
34|He looked 
up in the sky, let out a groan from deep within, and said to him “Effatha!”, which 
means, “Be opened up, all the way!”. 
35|His hearing was restored,[r] and his 
speaking impairment was broken,[s] and he began to speak correctly. 
36|He gave 
them orders, in no uncertain terms, not to tell anyone, but the more he would leave 
orders, the more they went about spreading the word to others.[E]

*[A]Defiled…in this context refers to something which was once or should be clean to the Jews but has 
transgressed into a state of uncleanness, temporarily (like in the case of unclean hands) or permanently. 
The Jews fit things into categories of clean and unclean, which leads to permissible and forbidden, and 
there were rules for restoring something which is unclean to clean. These rules should have been 
derived from the Law of Moses, but tradition was introduced alongside, and in cases supplanted, the 
Law of Moses, and this supplanting is what Jesus has issue with.
*[B]Verse 16 omitted from some of the better manuscripts.
*[C]you’re allowed to eat any kind of food…Lit: making clean all the food. A subset of the Law of Moses is 
the kosher laws, which specifies certain food as “unclean” and therefore not permitted to be eaten. This 
single statement by Jesus obsoletes all the kosher laws, making it permissible for all food to be eaten 
from that time onward. This was a controversy in the first century church.
*[D]take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs…Recall that in vv. 24,25 Jesus came to the house to 
get away from the crowds, because he needed a break. Then this Syro-Phoenician woman arrived and 
spoiled this respite. Jesus tells her that the Gentiles are a lower priority than the Jews: the children 
referred to in v.27 are the Israelites; the children’s bread is Jesus’s miraculous ministry; the children will 
“eat until they’re full,” then the Gentiles (the “dogs”) can take their turn. Her response is that the dogs 
eat at the same time as the children, not afterwards. Her faith got her the crumbs she was looking for.
[E]He gave them orders…that they should not tell anyone…they went about spreading the word to 
others…There are multiple instances where Jesus tells one or several people to keep quiet about the 
miracles he’s done, and they disobey. The result of their disobedience is that it limits the number of 
people Jesus can heal or otherwise set free; their disobedience causes others to continue in their 
suffering.

37|They were 
continuously overflowing with amazement saying, “All the good he’s accomplished—he 
even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak.”


&MARK 8
1|Around that time, a huge crowd had formed yet again. As they didn’t have 
anything to eat, he summoned his disciples and engages them thus, 
2|”I feel deeply 
sorry for the crowd, because they’ve been staying here with me for three days already, 
and they don’t have anything to eat. 
3|If I were to disperse them not having eaten in a 
long time, they’d collapse on the way home; and some of them came from far away.”
          
4|They replied, “Where can any of these people here get enough food[a] to eat 
out in the middle of nowhere?”
          
5|He asked, “How much bread do you have?”
      They said, “Seven loaves.”
          
6|He told the crowd to find a spot on the ground to relax,[A] and he took the 
seven loaves, gave thanks, broke them,[b] and began to hand them to his disciples, so 
that they would place them within reach of the crowd; and they distributed them. 

7|They had a few fishes too, and after consecrating them, he said for them to be 
distributed as well. 
8|They ate until they were full, and there were seven basketfuls of 
leftover scraps and pieces. 
9|Now there were four thousand men there, and he 
dispersed them. 
10|Immediately, he got into the boat with his disciples and went to 
Dalmanutha.
          
11|The Pharisees came out and began to question him, looking for a 
spectacular miracle[c]. 
12|He groaned in his spirit and uttered, “Why does this 
prevailing Zeitgeist seek a spectacular miracle[B]? Mark my words: there’s not a chance 
that those of that mindset will ever get one.[C]” 
13|He left them, yet again got into 
the boat, and went to the other side.
          
14|Except for one loaf, they forgot to take any bread[d] along with them in 
the boat. 
15|He proceeded to open up with them about what was on his mind, 
“Look out for the Pharisees’ and Herodians’[D] yeast.” 
16|They went over this again 
and again with one another, since they didn’t have any bread. 
17|Knowing this, he 
addressed them, “After all this discussion, what’s this conclusion that you’ve come to: 
that you don’t have any bread? You haven’t noticed yet, nor have you put all the pieces 
together, have you? Are your hearts that callous? 
18|While you have eyes, you 
don’t see, and while you have ears, you don’t listen? You all don’t remember? 

19|When I dedicated[e] the five loaves for the five thousand, how many leftover 
basketfuls[E] of scraps did we pick up?—twelve. 
20|When I dedicated the seven 
loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of scraps did we pick up?—seven.” 

21|He continued speaking, “You still don’t get it, do you?[F]”
          
22|He arrived at Bethsaida. They brought him a blind man and begged him 
to touch him. 
23|He took the blind man’s hand and brought him outside of the 
town, spat on his eyes, laid his hands on him, and asked him, “What do you see?” 

24|He opened his eyes, looked about, and said repeatedly, “I’m looking at the 
people here, because I see tree-like objects walking around.[G]” 
25|Yet again he laid 
his hands on his eyes, and his vision was restored completely, and he was seeing clearly 
at a distance. 
26|He sent him home saying, “Please don’t go into town.”
          
27|Jesus and his disciples left for the town of Caesarea, Philippi. On the 
way, he asked his disciples, “Who do folks say that I am?” 
28|They said, “John the 
Baptist…others say Elijah…still others say one of the prophets like in the Old Testament.” 

29|He asked the question, coming from himself, “And who do you—never mind 
everyone else—say that I am?” Peter, mindful of the question, answers, “You are the 
Messiah, the Christ.” 
30|He sternly commanded them not to tell anyone about him.
          
31|He began to explain to them that the Man[f] must endure a good amount 
of suffering and be rejected by the high court, the chief priests, and the designated 
teachers,[g] will be killed, and will rise from the dead after three days. 
32|He was 
speaking this fact plainly.[H] Peter cornered him and began to reprimand him. 

33|He turned and, looking at his disciples, scolded Peter, “Take a hike, you minion 
of Satan![h] You’re not exercising common-sense wisdom in the things of God—see—but 
rather the things of mankind.”
          
34|He summoned the crowd to join him and his disciples and said to them, 
“If anyone desires to follow after me, let him deny[i] himself, let him take up his cross, 
and let him follow me. 
35|The fact is, whoever desires to preserve his life[j] destroys 
it; and he who destroys his life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News[k] will 
preserve it. 
36|For what benefit is it to a person to gain the whole world and lose 
his life? 
37|For what can a man give in exchange for his life?

&MARK 9
1|He continued speaking to them:[A] “I really mean it when I tell you that some who 
got to stand right here won’t taste death until they get the chance to behold God’s 
involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) having made its arrival in a deluge of 
miraculous power[a].”
          
2|Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him and brought them 
to a high mountain, by themselves, and he transformed himself in their presence. 

3|His clothing shined a bright white, in a way like no sort of bleach on this planet can 
whiten. 
4|Elijah and Moses together as a pair appeared to them, and they were having 
a conversation with Jesus. 
5|Peter thought a bit and said to Jesus, “Jesus—good thing 
we’re here with you. We’ll make three little holy edifices[b]: one for you, one for Moses, 
and one for Elijah.” 
6|The fact is, he didn’t know what to say; they had become 
terrified indeed. 
7|A cloud appeared, engulfing them in a shadow, and a voice 
appeared out of the cloud, “This is my Beloved Son: listen[c] to him again and again.” 

8|Suddenly, they looked around and didn’t see anyone else with them except for 
Jesus only.
          
9|While they were descending the mountain, he ordered them not to repeat in 
detail what had happened to anyone, except after the Man[d] is resurrected from the 
dead. 
10|They kept the matter to themselves, discussing with one another what to be 
“resurrected from the dead” means. 
11|Questioning him, they said, “Why is it that 
the designated teachers[e] say that Elijah has to come first?” 
12|In the course of 
telling them he said, “Sure—Elijah comes and sets everything right again; but how is it 
that, concerning the Man, the Old Testament states that he must suffer greatly and be 
treated with utter contempt? 
13|Anyway—I’m telling you that even Elijah has 
come[f], and they did to him all the things they had always wanted to do[g], just like it 
had been recorded about him in the Old Testament.”
          
14|Having arrived back at where his disciples were, they saw that a huge 
crowd had surrounded them and that designated teachers were arguing with them. 

15|Straightaway, the entire crowd, seeing them, got in a tizzy, rushed over, and 
began to hail him. 
16|He asked, “What seems to be the 
problem[h]?”
17|Someone in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought my son, who 
has a demonic spirit of muteness[i], to you. 
18|Whenever it takes control of him, it 
throws him on the ground, and he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth[B], and he 
goes rigid, tucking into a fetal position[C]. I spoke to your disciples so that they would cast 
it out, and they weren’t able to.” 
19|He answered, “Oh, this prevailing Zeitgeist[j] of 
unbelief! How long do I have to hold your hand for?[k] How long do I have to put up 
with you for?—Bring him to me.” 
20|They brought him to him, and seeing him, the 
spirit immediately caused him to go into convulsions, drop to the ground, and roll 
around foaming at the mouth. 
21|He asked his father, “How long has this been 
going on?” He said, “Since childhood. 
22|Another thing…a lot of times he throws 
him into fire and into water[l], in order to destroy him—so now, if you can do anything, 
have a heart and help me out here.” 
23|Jesus said to him, “About that ‘if-you-can-
do-anything’ thing: all things are possible to the one believing.” 
24|Immediately 
the boy’s father began to say over and over, “I believe—help me with my unbelief!” 

25|Now Jesus, seeing that the crowd rushed on over to join them, dropped the 
hammer on the demonic spirit[m], “I command you, you deaf and dumb spirit: come out 
of him and never reenter[n].” 
26|He screamed and shook him with one last 
convulsion and came out. He was laid out like a dead body, so much so that many were 
going around saying that he died. 
27|Jesus grabbed his hand and pulled him up, 
and he stood up. 
28|After they got to be alone in a house, his disciples asked him, 
“Why is it that we couldn’t cast it out?” 
29|He said, “This type can’t be cast out by 
anyone except by prayer.[D]”
          
30|They left there and started going throughout Galilee, and all the while 
didn’t want to have any interaction with anyone[o], 
31|since he kept on working at 
getting his disciples up to speed, saying repeatedly, “People are going to take the Man[p] 
into custody, they’ll kill him, and, after he’s dead, he’ll be resurrected in three days.”[E] 

32|They weren’t making any sense of the remark and all the while were afraid to 
ask him about it.
          
33|They went to Capernaum. When they got back home, he asked, “What 
were you trying to figure out on the way over?” 
34|They kept quiet, since on the 
way over they were trying to figure out who among them was number-one. 
35|He 
took a seat, called the Twelve over, and engages them, “If someone wants to be number-
one, he must assume last place out of everyone and become everyone’s servant.” 

36|He took a child, stood him in front of them, put his arm around him[q], and told 
them, 
37|”Whoever receives a child, like this one here, as part of their Christian 
duty[r] receives me, and whoever receives me doesn’t receive me per se but receives the 
One who sent me.”
          
38|John said to him, “Teacher, we saw a guy casting out demons, assuming 
to do so under your authority[r], and we intervened and prevented him from doing it, 
because he’s not one of our trainees nor is he affiliated with us[s].” 
39|Jesus said, 
“Don’t get in his way, since there is no one, when presuming to act under my authority,[r] 
who will do something supernatural and will then be able to quickly turn to bad-mouth 
me. 
40|The fact is, he who’s not against us is in favor of us. 
41|Indeed, if one 
were to do you a good turn because you are considered to be Christians[F], I tell you for 
sure that in no uncertain terms would this person lose out on the payment that’s 
coming to him.”
          
42|”Whoever tries to trip up or draw into sin[t] even the most insignificant 
person who believes in me, he’d be better off tossed into the ocean and standing at the 
bottom of it with a millstone strapped to his neck. 
43|And if your right hand (i.e., 
whatever thing you’re doing) causes you to sin[t], chop it off (i.e., quit it—period): you’re 
better off going through life maimed than being sent to hell having two hands, into the 
Inextinguishable Fire. 
44|[G] 
45|And if your foot (i.e., the direction your life is 
going in; what you’re in the habit of doing) causes you to sin, chop it off: you’re better off 
going through life lame than to be sent to hell having two feet. 
46|[G] 
47|And if 
your eye (i.e., what your attention is continuously focused on) causes you to sin, yank it out: 
you’re better off going through life with one eye than to be sent to hell having both 
eyes, 
48|where their parasitic worm infection will never go away and the fire won’t 
go out.[G]
          
49|”For all meats roasted by a fire will be salted.[H] 
*[a]in a storm of miraculous power…Lit: in power; with power. A figure of speech.
*[b]We’ll make three little holy edificies…Ref. note of Matt. 17:4
*[c]listen…The verb tense of the word listen here means to listen on an ongoing basis—not just a single 
time
*[d]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[e]the designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes. Ref. note of Matt. 7:29.
*[f]I’m telling you that even Elijah has come…Or perhaps, I’m telling you that Elijah has come also
*[g]all the things they had always wanted to do…Lit: whatever they were wanting to. The verb tense used 
here for were wanting insinuates going through an agenda of all sorts of pent-up desires.
*[h]What seems to be the problem…Lit: What are you discussing/arguing about with them?
*[i]a demonic spirit of muteness…Lit: a mute spirit
*[j]Oh, this prevailing Zeitgeist of unbelief!…Lit: Oh, unbelieving generation!
*[k]how long do I have to hold your hand for?…Lit: how long will I be with you?
*[l]a lot of times he throws him into fire and into water…Ref. note of Matt. 17:15
*[m]dropped the hammer on the demonic spirit…Lit: rebuked the unclean spirit
*[n]and never reenter…Lit: and you may no longer enter into him. The mood of the sentence speaks of the 
possibility of re-entering hypothetically, as it would not actually ever happen.
*[o]to have any interaction with anyone…Lit: that someone might know him
*[p]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[q]put his arm around him…Lit: put him in his arms, or, embraced him. Perhaps also, hugged him.
*[r]as part of their Christian duty…Lit: in my name
*[s]because he’s not one of our trainees nor is he affiliated with us…Lit: because he doesn’t follow us
*[t]trip up or draw into sin…sin…In v. 42 trip up are the same Gk. words used in Matt. 18:6; ref. note from 
there. Also, in v. 43 and onwards, the word sin is the same word as trip up; note of Matt. 18:6 also 
applies.
*[u]all meats roasted by a fire will be salted. salt is good…Or: All meats roasted in a fire will be salted with 
a salt which is good. It’s possible that v. 50 is the direct object of the sentence in v. 49, however Luke 
14:34 suggests that it’s not.

*[A]He continued speaking to them…This is an uninterrupted thought from the end of the eighth chapter 
(Mark 8:39)
*[B]he foams at the mouth and gnashes his teeth…Lit: he foams and gnashes the teeth. In the GT, two 
rhyming words are used for foams and gnashes: aphridzay kai tridzay (ἀφρίζει καὶ τρίζει) 
(ἀφρίζει /Strong’s 875), (καὶ /Strong’s 2532), (τρίζει/Strong’s 5149). This rhyme or assonance presents a 
reasonable depiction of the truth (but not necessarily 100% accuracy) in an idiomatic expression. Similar 
to this, in English we say: wear and tear; hem and haw; whoop and holler; slip and slide.
*[C]he goes rigid, tucking into a fetal position…Lit: he shrivels (dries) up. Same Gk. word used in Matt. 12:9 
when describing the man with the shriveled hand. The boy became like a plant, a vegetable, or some 
other once-living object that shrivels up when it has dried out. When something like this dries out, it 
becomes stiff, shrinks in size, and tends to curl up upon itself in a ball of a sort.
*[D]by prayer…Or: in prayer. Some manuscripts say by prayer and fasting. The word fasting was added 
decades or centuries after Mark wrote his original manuscript. A similar insertion was made in 1 Cor. 
7:5. There is no other NT reference that casting out evil spirits is contingent on fasting. Such false 
manuscript insertions (Mark 9:29, 1 Cor. 7:5, Matt. 6:13, Mark 9:44) follow a pattern: years after the NT 
books were written, a few religious-minded folks read such passages and felt that God’s Word was not 
severe enough, or pious enough, or austere enough; or fearful of evil forces enough, and needed them 
to doctor it a bit.
*[E]People are going to take the Man into custody, they’ll kill him, and, after he’s dead, he’ll be resurrected 
in three days…Lit: The Son of Man is being handed over into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and, 
having died, after three days he will be resurrected. By using the present tense here in is being handed 
over, Jesus is summarizing a series or collection of events that will stretch out over days, and not just 
happen in minutes. 
*[F]Indeed, if one were to do you a good turn because you are considered to be Christians…Lit: For he who 
were to give you all a cup of water to drink by name [i.e. reputation], because you all are of Christ, 
…Interpreting this statement literally makes no sense, because of the disagreement in plurality, 
specifically that one cup of water is being offered to “you all”: several people. This leads to the 
conclusion that the Gk. phrase for giving a cup of water is an idiomatic expression, the meaning of which 
is obvious. In addition, there is some disagreement in the manuscripts for the words by name (or, as 
others assume, in name). Some manuscripts have changed in name to in his name. The significance of 
this is to highlight the ambiguity of the meaning of this phrase. As such, a secondary translation of in 
name was chosen, one found in the OT: in reputation. This clarifies the ambiguity.
*[G]where their parasitic worm infection will never go away and the fire won’t go out…Lit: Where their 
worm has no demise and the fire won’t go out. Some manuscripts erroneously copied this over to vv. 44 
and 46. Ref. note of v.41. In any case, their worm here is a plural adjective modifying a singular noun; 
therefore, the “worm” referred to here is likely a bodily ailment, a parasitic infestation of worms, 
something like tapeworms or roundworms (ascariasis). In his short description of hell in v. 48, Jesus says 
that those in hell have worm infestations on the inside and are surrounded by fire on the outside. As the 
symptoms of a worm infestation include (but are not limited to) nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, a lack 
of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, Jesus was saying that those in hell experience these 
symptoms.
[H]all meats roasted by a fire will be salted…Or: everyone will be salted by a fire. Verses 49 and 50 are 
ambiguous. For v. 49, some manuscripts read, for all sacrifices will be salted with salt. Though this 
alternate reading has been rejected as spurious, the authors’ instincts for the true interpretation of 
these verses should not be. Therefore, the assumption is that v. 49 speaks of meats being seasoned with 
salt while being roasted, with salt added as a preservative. Verse 50 reads, as you have salt embedded in 
yourselves. This becomes a metaphor; believers are compared to a hunk of meat which is roasted over a 
fire, having salt applied to them. After the roasting is complete, they have the salt in themselves, which 
means that they have the preservative effects of it. This affect is what allows them to live in peace with 
one another.

&MARK 10
1|He headed out from there and went to the Judean area, on the other side of 
the Jordan River, and a crowd gathered around him again, and he began teaching them 
again per usual. 
2|Some Pharisees went up to him and started asking if it’s legal[A] for 
a husband to divorce his wife,[a] trying to catch him in a mistake. 
3|His reply to them 
was, “What does the Old Testament[b] command you to do?” 
4|They said, “The Old 
Testament allows you ‘…to write a divorce certificate and cut her loose’[c].” 
5|Jesus 
said, “This commandment, when written, was directed towards your hard-
heartedness.[d] 
6|But from the beginning of creation, ‘He made them man and woman, 
husband and wife[e]. 
7|On account of this, a man shall leave behind his mother and 
father and shall stick to his woman, his wife[f], 
8|and the two will be made into one 
flesh, resulting in their no longer being two individual fleshes but one flesh[g].’ 
9|That 
which God joined let no person separate.” 
10|When they got back home again, the 
disciples asked him about this. 
11|He tells them, “Whoever cuts his wife loose (i.e., 
divorces her) and marries another woman commits adultery with[h] her, 
12|and if she, 
having been cut loose from her husband, marries another, she commits adultery.”
          
13|They brought children to him for him to affect through touch, but his 
disciples scolded them. 
14|Seeing this, Jesus became indignant and said to them, 
“Evermore let the children come to me, and don’t get in their way, since whom God 
interacts with (God’s kingdom) is drawn from such as these. 
15|Let me tell you 
what: whoever won’t receive God’s kingdom like a child would, certainly won’t enter 
it.” 
16|He put his arms around them and pronounced a blessing over them while 
laying his hands on them.
          
17|While venturing out on the road, someone ran up, fell to his knees before 
him, and asked him,
      “Good teacher, what do I have to do to lay claim to that special fullness of life 
(eternal life)?”
          
18|Jesus said, “Why do you call me ‘good’?[B] Nobody’s good except for one 
person: God. 
19|You know the commandments…do not murder…do not commit 
adultery…don’t steal…don’t lie when called on to make a statement for the 
record…don’t rip each other off[i]…honor your mother and father.”
          
20|So he said, “Teacher, I’ve been vigilant to keep all of these since I was a 
teenager.”
          
21|So Jesus stared at him and felt an appreciation for the great value of his 
life[j] and said, “You’re missing one piece: go out and sell what you have and give it to 
the poor, and you’ll have treasure in heaven, and come back to this spot and be my 
follower.”
          
22|Now he became melancholy over this remark and departed with a sulk, 
since he owned a lot of stuff[k]. 
23|Jesus looked around and mused to his disciples, 
“How difficult indeed it is for someone who owns a lot of stuff to have God interact 
with him (enter God’s kingdom).” 
24|His disciples were simply stunned by this 
statement. But again Jesus, from out of his contemplation, said to them, “Boys[l], how 
difficult it is to enter God’s kingdom. 
25|It’s easier for a camel to crouch down and 
crawl through a small gate portal[m] than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom.” 

26|But still in a state of shock, they say to one another, “And how can anyone be 
kept from this[n]?” 
27|Jesus stared at them and declares, “With people, it’s not 
possible—certainly not without God; for all things are possible with God.” 
28|Peter 
proceeded to say to him, “Look—we for our part left everything so that we could 
become your followers.” 
29|Jesus said, “I’m telling you for sure: nobody who’s left 
his home or his brother or sister or mother or father or child or livelihood on account of 
me and on account of the Good News[o] 
30|will fail to receive big time[p]—right now 
in this present age—homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, livelihoods—along with 
persecution, and that special fullness of life (eternal life) in the age to come. 
31|And 
many who are first will be last and last first.”
          
32|They were on their way over to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading the 
pack. They were all the while stunned: those following his lead were in a state of fear. 
Confiding in the Twelve, he began to go over with them what would happen to him, 
the things in motion that were converging. 
33|”…Because, you see, we’re going to 
Jerusalem, and the Man[q] will be apprehended by the chief priests and the designated 
teachers[r], they’ll sentence him to death, and hand him over to the Gentiles. 

34|They’ll make fun of him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him, and after three 
days, he’ll be resurrected.”
          
35|James and John, the sons of Zebedee, wandered over to him and said to 
him,
       “Teacher, we want to ask a favor of you.”
          
36|He said, “What do you want me to do for you?”
          
37|They said, “Let one of us be your number-one man and the other your 
number-two when you’re invested in your regal power.[s]”
          
38|Jesus said, “You don’t have any idea what you’re asking for. Can you go 
through what I have to go through or get in up to your neck in the same things I have 
to?[t]”
          
39|They said, “We can.”
      Jesus said, “What I’ll go through, so will you, and what I’ll be up to my neck in, 
so will you.[t] 
40|But to be my number-one or number-two man is not for me to 
grant, but is reserved for those for whom it has been prepared.”
          
41|Once they heard about this, the ten became furious with James and John. 

42|Jesus called them over and tells them, “You’re aware that those considered to be 
leaders of the peoples throughout the earth subjugate the populace, and their chiefs[C], 
filled with charisma and valor, maintain absolute authority over them. 
43|But it will 
not be this way among you; instead, whoever would desire to be a charismatic, valor-
filled chief among you will be everyone’s servant[u], 
44|and whoever would desire 
to be number-one among you will be everyone’s servant, 
45|seeing that the Man 
didn’t come to be served either, but instead to serve and to give his life-being as a 
ransom payment to ransom the many.”
          
46|They came to Jericho, and while he, his disciples, and a sizeable crowd 
were departing Jericho, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus[D] by name, a blind beggar, was 
sitting alongside the road. 
47|Having heard that Jesus of Nazareth was the reason 
for the crowd, he began to cry out repeatedly, saying,
      “Jesus, you marvelous godsend[v], have pity on me!”
          
48|Many scolded him to hush him up, but he cried out all the more, “You 
marvelous godsend, have pity on me!”
          
49|Jesus stood still and said, “Call him over.”
      They called for the blind man, saying to him, “Brace yourself[w]—get up, he’s 
calling you.”
          
50|He threw off his cloak,[E] shot up, and went to Jesus. 
51|Jesus 
answered, “What can I do for you?”
      The blind man said, “Teacher—I just want to see again[F].”
          
*[a]a husband to divorce his wife…Ref. note of Matt. 5:31
*[b]the Old Testament…Lit: Moses. His name is synonymous with his writing, the Law of Moses, the Torah
*[c]to write a divorce certificate and cut her loose…Quotation from Deut. 24:1
*[d]was directed towards your hard-heartedness…Lit: Moses wrote this command to your hard-
heartedness
*[e]husband and wife…Ref. note of Matt. 19:4
*[f]and shall stick to his woman, his wife…Ancient NT manuscripts are divided as to whether this phrase is 
spurious or not.
*[g]no longer being two individual fleshes but one flesh…Lit: no longer two but one flesh. The omission of 
the word flesh before two (not: no longer two flesh) is a figure of speech. Also, ref. Matt. 19:6.
*[h]with her…Lit: against her
*[i]don’t rip each other off …This statement is not found in all the ancient manuscripts, and therefore may 
be spurious.
*[j]felt an appreciation for the great value of his life…Lit: loved [agapaō, (ἀγαπάω/Strong’s 25)]. Though 
agapā means love, it’s the ability to see the great worth in even one who appears most undeserving.
*[k]owned a lot of stuff…Also: owned a lot of property
*[l]Boys…Lit: children. Similar usage in John 21:5. It does not mean “children” in the literal sense, but in 
this context means “boys”, “lads”, or perhaps even “folks.”
*[m]It’s easier for a camel to pass through a small gate portal…Lit: It’s easier for a camel to pass through 
the eye of a needle…Ref. note of Matt. 19:24
*[n]And how can anyone be kept from this…Lit: And who can be saved?
*[o]Good News…Lit: the Gospel
*[p]big time…Lit: a hundred-fold
*[q]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[r]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[s]Let one of us be your number-one man and the other your number-two, when you’re invested in your 
regal power…Lit: Give to us so that one would sit at your right and one at your left in your glory
*[t]Can you go through what I have to go through or get in up to your neck in the same things I have 
to?…What I’ll go through, so will you, and what I’ll be up to my neck in, so will you…Lit: (v.38): Can you 
be drinking the cup which I drink or be baptized in the baptism which I am being baptized; (v.39): The cup 
which I drink, you will drink, and the baptism which I’m being baptized in, you will be baptized.
*[u]servant…Also: slave
*[v]you marvelous godsend…Lit: Son David. Ref. note of Matt. 12:23.
*[w]Brace yourself…Also: courage; cheer up; take heart. Ref. note of John 16:33.
*[x]has pulled you through…Lit: has saved you. Ref. Mark 5:34.

*[A]if it’s legal…The legality here is with respect to the Law of Moses
*[B]Why do you call me ‘good’?…Also ref. to note of Matt. 19:17. Why does Jesus take issue with being 
called good? He is good, of course. Two answers. First, he does not receive such pronouncements by any 
person, only by his Father. For the same reason, he rebuked demons when they said that he’s the Christ. 
It is the truth indeed, but such a truth he will only hear spoken by his Father. Second, he is still under the 
grand trial appointed to him by his Father, which will only be complete after his crucifixion. In his 
humility, he doesn’t consider himself to have earned the title of ‘good’ yet, and won’t until he’s raised 
from the dead. At that time, his Father will call him good, and not he call himself good.
*[C]chiefs…Lit: great ones. Implies that they are charismatic, are valor-filled, and have despotic tendencies.
*[D]Bartimaeus…Aramaic for son of Timaeus; the Gk. equivalent is listed first but he goes by the Aramaic 
name. Mark is presenting Bartimaeus in a more familiar light, as an ordinary, common man—indeed, the 
lowest of the low.
*[E]He threw off his cloak…Some have asserted that Bartimaeus’s cloak was required of him being a 
beggar, and that he, casting it aside, believed he would be healed and therefore not need it anymore.
[F]Teacher, I just want to see again…Lit: Rabbi—so that I would see again. First, rabbi here is one of the 
few places where Mark uses an Aramaic word. Second, only the second half of the sentence (so that I 
would see again) is spoken; the first half is understood. Together, this shows Bartimaeus speaking in an 
everyday, ordinary, down-to-earth way, expected of one so low on the social hierarchy.

&MARK 11
1|When they neared Jerusalem, arriving at Bethphage and Bethany at the 
Mount of Olives, he sent out two of his disciples. 
2|He, giving instructions, says to 
them, “Go over to the town across the way from where you’re at, and as you go in, 
immediately you’ll find a colt which no person has ever mounted tied down. Untie it 
and start bringing it back. 
3|If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ Say, ‘His 
master needs it,’ and bring it back here right away.” 
4|They left and found a colt tied 
to a gate which was up against the street, and they untied it. 
5|Some people who were 
standing there proceeded to tell them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 

6|They told them what Jesus said, and they left them alone. 
7|They then bring the 
colt to Jesus, toss their outer garments on it, and he mounted it. 
8|Many people 
spread their outer garments out on the road, and others spread tall grass out, which was 
chopped down and brought over from the fields. 
9|Those preceding and those 
following kept on shouting out,

Rescue us[a]!
Praise be to him who comes at the Lord’s behest.

10|Praise be to the coming monarchy of our patriarch David.
Rescue us to the max!

          
11|He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple complex and looked 
around at everything. It being late in the day already, he departed with the Twelve for 
Bethany. 
12|The next day, while they were leaving Bethany, 
13|seeing from a 
distance a fig tree that was in leaf, he went over to it, if perchance he would find 
anything nestled in it, and when he got up close to it, he found nothing except for leaves, 
since figs weren’t in season.[A] 
14|He considered the situation and said, “No 
longer—forever and ever—will anyone eat fruit which you’ve yielded.” And his 
disciples were listening when he said it.
          
15|They then come to Jerusalem. After entering the temple complex, he began 
to throw out the salesmen and the merchandisers doing business in the temple, and he 
turned over the tables of the money changers and of those who were seated selling 
doves.[B] 
16|He wasn’t letting anyone transport boxes[b] containing merchandise 
through the temple. 
17|He was going about instructing them and, as part of doing 
so, said to them, “Has it not been written in the Scriptures, ‘My house shall be called a 
house of prayer among all the nations’?—But you have made it into a robber’s 
hideout[C].” 
18|The chief priests and the designated teachers[c] heard about this and 
were trying to find a way they could eliminate him; the fact was, the crowd was amazed 
at his teaching. 
19|He was in the habit of leaving the city when evening arrived.
          
20|Passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree shriveled up from the 
roots on up. 
21|Peter recalled the incident and as a result says, “Teacher, look—the 
fig tree which you cursed is all shriveled up.” 
22|Jesus, considering what 
happened, replied to them, “Have the God-kind of faith[d].[D][E] 
23|I’m telling you 
the truth—if someone were to speak to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the 
sea,’ and would not doubt[d] in his heart but instead would believe[d] that that which he 
says is coming to pass, it will be that way with him. 
24|On account of this, I say to 
you: all things which you all ask for in prayer[e], believe[d] that you have received[E][F], 
and it will be that way with you. 
25|And when you’re standing up praying, if you 
have something against someone, forgive, so that our Father in heaven would forgive 
you of your sins.” 
26|[G]
          
27|He went to Jerusalem again. While he was walking about the temple 
compound, the chief priests, the designated teachers, and the councilmen[f] approached 
him. 
28|They started speaking to him,
      “By what authority do you do these things? In other words, who gave you the 
authority to do these things?”
          
29|Jesus said, “You answer my question, and I’ll answer yours.[g] 

30|John’s baptism: was his authority to baptize derived from heaven[h] or from 
mankind?—Answer me.”
          
31|They talked it over amongst themselves, saying, “If we say ‘From 
heaven’, he’ll say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe in him?’ 
32|But if we say, ‘From 
mankind,’…”—They feared the crowd, since everyone considered John to be a prophet. 

*[a]Rescue us…Lit: hosanna. Ref. note of Matt 21:9
*[b]boxes…Lit: vessels. (Some liberty taken by using boxes.)
*[c]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[d]Have the God-kind of faith…The verb tense of this verb (and the other references) insinuate 
continuous action. This is not a one-time having, believing, or doubting, but a continuation of it 
unbounded by time.
*[e]ask for in prayer…Lit: pray and ask. The wording here is a figure of speech called a hendiadys; ref. note 
of Matt. 3:11.
*[f]the chief priests, the designated teachers, and the councilmen…Lit: the chief priests, the Scribes, and 
the Elders
*[g]You answer my question, and I’ll answer yours…Lit: I’ll ask you one question, you’ll answer me, and I’ll 
tell you by what authority I do these things
*[h]was his authority to baptize derived from heaven…Lit: was it from heaven

*[A]Since figs weren’t in season…Jesus found no figs on the fig tree when it wasn’t fig season and as a 
result cursed the tree. Why did Jesus expect to find figs on a tree when it wasn’t fig season? There are 
two times a year in which a fig tree bears figs. The main crop is in the late summer or fall and a 
secondary crop (called a breba) is in the spring. The breba crop comes from shoots from the previous 
fall’s crop. Also, over the winter a fig tree will shed leaves. New leaves grow back in the spring, and this 
is what the phrase in leaf refers to in v. 13. Also, the appearance of these new leaves coincides with the 
breba crop; hence, Jesus saw the new leaves and expected to see figs. When Mark said in v.13 that “figs 
weren’t in season,” he’s referring to the fall crop, not the breba crop.
*[B]those who were seated selling doves…Ref. note of Matt. 12:21
*[C]robber’s hideout…The Gk. word used here and in Matt. 21:13 is for robber and not the one for thief. A 
robber (not a thief) is described in Prov. 1:8–19. He is one who lies in wait for his victim and will apply 
violence wantonly for even paltry gain. In modern times, you find thugs such as these in gangs or with 
drug traffickers.
*[D]Have the God-kind of faith…Lit: Be-having faith of-God. A couple of relevant facts concerning the Gk. 
grammar in this short statement. First, the verb tense (present) of have insinuates not just having once 
and being done with it but having continuously. Second, the lack of the definite article before faith is 
conspicuous and was omitted intentionally by Mark. As a point of contrast, consider the example of Acts 
3:16, where the definite article is used before faith (and this in a prepositional phrase, which often omits 
an expected definite article). In the case of v. 22 here, the omission of the definite article emphasizes 
the nature of the faith. Furthermore, the word God is in the genitive case, but when a possessive is 
constructed in Gk. (an example in English would be, “This is Mary’s jar,” where Mary appears in the 
possessive form), it normally consists of the definite article first, followed by the noun, followed by 
perhaps another article, then the genitive form of the noun doing the possessing. Since the initial 
definite article is missing, this disrupts the normal pattern of a Gk. possessive form, and signals a 
different meaning to the reader. Third, the lack of definite article before faith emphasizes the nature of 
the faith.
*[E]Have the God-kind of faith…believe that you have received…Some of the ancient manuscripts have 
doctored a few key words in vv.23,24. This is related to previous note. A minor change is in v. 23: some 
manuscripts have inserted the word to, changing it from: have God’s faith, to, if you have God’s faith. A 
larger change is in v. 24: some manuscripts have changed the reading, believe that you have received, to, 
believe that you are receiving.
*[F]believe that you have received…To quote Max & Mary from A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New 
Testament with respect to the verb tense in the words have received: “the future regarded with such 
certitude that it is assumed to have been realized already, but in the present is not regarded as having 
been complete yet.”
[G]Verse 26’s ending, which reads, but if you don’t forgive, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your 
trespasses, is omitted as spurious. Ref. note of Matt. 17:21.

&MARK 12
1|He proceeded to speak to them by means of analogy[a]: “A man planted a 
vineyard, put a fence[b] around it, dug a wine press for it, leased it out to tenant 
gardeners, and went abroad. 
2|When the harvest season came, he sent a servant to the 
tenants to get his cut of the vineyard’s produce. 
3|They took him, beat him up, and 
sent him away empty-handed. 
4|Again, he sent them another servant, and they 
slapped him around and treated him with contempt. 
5|He sent yet another, and they 
killed that poor fellow too. And many others…some they beat, others they killed. 
6|He 
thought to himself, ‘I still have one more: a beloved son.’ Last of all, he sent him to them 
saying, ‘They’ll respect my son.’ 
7|But those tenants said to themselves, ‘This is the 
heir; come on, let’s go kill him, and we’ll lay claim to the estate.’ 
8|They took him, 
kicked him out of the vineyard, and killed him.[c] 
9|What, then, will the vineyard 
owner do? He’ll go and kill those tenants and lease out the vineyard to others. 

10|You’ve never read this verse, have you,

“The stone which the masons inspected and rejected—
This became the main cornerstone.

11|By the Lord’s doing it came to pass
And is something our eyes are in awe over.”


12|All the while they were seeking to get ahold of him, but were afraid of the crowd, 
since they knew that the analogy was directed at them. They left him alone and 
departed.
          
13|They sent some of the Pharisees and some Herod supporters[d] to him in 
order to catch him making a mistake while conversing. 
14|They went and said to 
him, “Teacher[A], we know that you’re honest and that what you teach is the true way to 
God and that you could care less what anyone thinks about you, all the more so since 
you’re not affected by people’s attitudes[e], but you teach God’s way in a truthful 
manner. Do we have to pay Caesar the poll tax or not? Shall we pay or not pay?” 

15|Having a full view of their hypocrisy presented before him, he said,
      “Why are you trying to trip me up? Bring me a coin[f] used for the tax payment so 
that I can take a look at it.”
          
16|They brought him one.
      He then says, “Whose picture do you see etched in here?”
      They said, “Caesar’s.”
          
17|Jesus said, “Give Caesar’s things to Caesar, and God’s things to God.”
      They were stunned.
          
18|The Sadducees, who claim that there is no life after death,[g] went up to 
him and put a question to him, 
19|”Teacher[A], the Old Testament[h] says that if 
someone’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind but didn’t leave a son, his brother will 
take the woman as his wife for the purpose of producing a male offspring for the sake of 
his dead brother. 
20|There were seven brothers. The first got married to a woman 
and died, not leaving a descendent, 
21|and the second took her as his wife and died, 
not leaving a descendent, and the third, and so forth. 
22|The seven left no 
descendent. Last of all, the woman died. 
23|Which of them will she be the wife of 
in the after-life, since all seven had married her?”
          
24|Jesus said, “Is it not on account of your not being familiar with the 
Scriptures nor with God’s supernatural ability that you get off-base? 
25|The fact is, 
when you die and live on in the after-life, there is no marriage, but instead you exist like 
the angels exist in the spiritual world.[i] 
26|But concerning life after death, that is, 
the fact that you take up a new life after you die: haven’t you read the story about the 
burning bush in the Old Testament[h] where it says, ‘I myself am the God of Abraham 
and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’? 
27|God’s not a God of the dead but of 
the living.[B] You’re really off-base.”
          
28|One of the designated teachers[j] heard them debating and seeing how 
well he replied to them asked him, “Which is the most important[k] commandment?” 

29|Jesus answered, “The most important one is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is 
one, 
30|and you will love the Lord your God from your entire heart, from your 
entire life being[l], from your entire mind, and from out of your entire might.’ 

31|The second most important commandment is, ‘You will love your neighbor as 
yourself.’ There’s no other commandment greater than these.” 
32|The designated 
teacher said to him, “Well-said, teacher, you really hit the nail on the head[m], since, ‘He 
is One and there is no other one than Him,’ 
33|plus the quotation ‘…to love him 
from the entire heart and from the entire conscience and from the entire strength,’ plus 
the quotation ‘…to love a neighbor as yourself’ exceeds all burnt offerings and 
sacrifices[C].” 
34|Jesus, seeing that he got it, replied, “You’re not far from God 
choosing to have a relationship with you (from God’s kingdom).” No one had the guts 
to ask him anything else any more.
          
35|After some thought, Jesus proceeded to speak, teaching in the temple, 
“Who do the designated teachers[j] say that the Messiah[n] is? 
36|David himself 
spoke by the Holy Spirit,

”An all-powerful Lord said to my lord,
Be my right-hand man
Until I decide to subdue your enemies and subjugate them to you[o]


37|”David himself calls him lord, so how can he be his descendant[p]?” The crowd, 
which was large, listened to him with delight.
          
38|He continued his teaching by saying to them, “Observe how the 
designated teachers like going about in the marketplaces and town squares wearing 
long robes, 
39|and occupy the most prestigious seats[D] in the synagogues and at 
banquets, 
40|those who gobble up widows’ homes[E] and ostentatiously pray long-
winded prayers: these guys will receive quite a harsh sentence[q] on judgment day.”
          
41|He seated himself across from the collection basket, and watched and 
watched people, just what amount of money[r] they were tossing into the basket; the rich 
people were tossing in great amounts. 
42|This one widow came and tossed in a 
couple of dollars[s]. 
43|He called his disciples over and said, “I’m telling you the 
honest-to-goodness truth: this widow, poor though she is, put in more than everyone 
else, 
*[a]analogy…Lit: parable
*[b]a fence…Lit: a hedge
*[c]They took him, kicked him out of the vineyard, and killed him…Lit: They took him, killed him, and drove 
him outside of the vineyard. The sequence of events was re-arranged to match the sequence from Matt 
21:39. Also, same wording for kicked him out as is used in Luke 13:28; ref. note there.

*[g]who claim there is no life after death…Lit: who say there isn’t a resurrection. The word resurrection 
here means life after death.
*[h]the Old Testament…Lit: Moses wrote or Moses. The Law of Moses or the Torah, in other words.
*[i]you exist like the angels exist in the spiritual world…Lit: but instead they are like the angels in the 
heavenlies. Also of note: in this passage, the word you is inserted instead of the actual word used in the 
GT, they.

*[q]quite a harsh sentence…Lit: an exceedingly abundant sentence. A figure of speech.
*[r]just what amount of money…Consisting of coins of various amounts
*[s]a couple of dollars…lit: a two-lepta coin. This is about the lowest denomination coin that was in 
circulation at the time.
*[t]everything she had to live on…This phrase is a repetition of the phrase every cent that she had. Such 
repetition is a figure of speech.

*[A]teacher…Mark uses the Gk. word for teacher here and not the Aramaic Rabbi used several verses 
earlier (ref. Mark 9:5; 11:21). The shift in Mark’s choice of the word for teacher here shows a subtle lack 
of affection and respect seeping out of the mouths of the Pharisees and Herodians (and later in v.19, the 
Sadducees), while they are trying to flatter Jesus. 
*[B]God’s not a God of the dead but of the living…The point Jesus is making is that in the story of the 
burning bush, when God speaks to Moses, he refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who had died many 
years earlier, in the present tense, not in the past tense. If there was no life-after-death, he would have 
referred to them in the past tense; his referring to them in the present tense is proof that they still exist 
even though they’re dead.
*[C]exceeds all burnt offerings and sacrifices…The Law of Moses in the Old Testament commands Jews to 
offer to God burnt offerings and sacrifices. Both the commandments quoted in this passage and burnt 
offerings and sacrifices are required by the self-same Law of Moses.
*[D]occupy the most prestigious seats…Lit: first-seated in the synagogues. In the Israel of the Bible, seating 
at any event, even ones not steeped in formality, was done by the relative ranking of those seated; the 
greater status of the guest, the closer to the front or closer to the host or most prominent attendee was 
he placed. This explains Luke 14:8.
[E]gobble up widows’ homes…Widows were the lowest ranked and most vulnerable in the socio-
economic hierarchy of ancient Israel. There are numerous admonitions in the Old Testament to care for 
widows, to not take advantage of them, to look out for their well-being.

&MARK 13
1|While leaving the temple, one of his disciples then says, “Teacher, look—
what breathtaking stones and edifices.” 
2|Jesus said to him, “See these great edifices 
here? Not a single stone here will remain on top of another stone which will not in any 
way get torn down.” 
3|Sitting across from temple on the Mount of Olives alone with 
Peter, James, John, and Andrew, 
4|they asked him confidentially, “When will these 
things take place, and what will be the sign[a] indicating when the conclusion[b] of all 
things is supposed to happen?” 
5|Jesus began by saying to them, “See to it that no one 
gets you off-base; 
6|many will come claiming to have my authority[c] saying, ‘I am the 
one-and-only one,’[A] and many will get off-base. 
7|When you hear about there being 
wars and news of wars that are right around the corner, don’t get rattled: these things have 
to happen, but it’s not over[d] yet. 
8|You see, nations and ethnic groups will assert 
themselves against or attack other nations and ethnic groups, and kingdoms against 
kingdoms; there’ll be earthquakes from place to place; there’ll be famines—these are the 
first labor pains. 
9|For your part, look after yourselves; they’ll take you into custody 
and drag you before the local council[B], they’ll work you over[e] in the synagogues, and 
on account of me you’ll be made to stand before rulers and kings and testify before 
them. 
10|The Good News[f] must be proclaimed to all the nations and ethnic 
groups. 
11|When they take you away into custody, don’t worry beforehand what 
you’ll say, but instead what you’re going to say will be given to you the very moment 
it’s needed; you see, it’s not you who’s doing the talking but rather the Holy Spirit. 

12|A brother will betray a brother to the point of death, and a father his son, and 
children will turn against their parent, defy them, and become hostile towards them, 
and because of this they’ll be put to death. 
13|You’ll be hated by everyone on 
account of you doing what I told you to do[g]. He who perseveres until it’s all over—
that’s the sort of guy who’ll survive.
          
14|”When you see the ‘abomination that causes things to fall into 
desolation[h]’—the Prophet Daniel’s prophecy—standing where it shouldn’t (have the 
one who reads this out loud to the congregation get up to speed on this ahead of time)[C], 
then have those in Judea flee to the mountains. 
15|Don’t have whoever’s on the 
porch go down, go in, and fetch anything out of the house,[D] 
16|and don’t have 
whoever’s in the field turn around and grab his coat. 
17|Oh, how terrible[i] it’ll be 
for women at that time who are pregnant or have infants![E] 
18|Hope to God[j] that it 
won’t be wintertime. 
19|You see, there’ll be a tremendous amount of suffering, 
such which hasn’t occurred from the beginning of time until now and will never 
happen again. 
20|If it weren’t for those days having been cut short, then not a 
single living being[k] would survive; but those days will be cut short on account of the 
Chosen Ones[l]. 
21|At that time, if someone says to you, ‘Look here—the Messiah’ 
or ‘Here he is’, don’t believe him, 
22|since false messiahs will come to the forefront 
and produce great signs[a] and wonders in order to deceive, if possible, the Chosen 
Ones. 
23|Keep your eyes open—I’ve told you this ahead of time.
          
24|”More to the point, though, in those days, after that ordeal of suffering,

“The sun will go dark,
And the moon won’t shine.

25|The stars will be falling out of the sky.
The wonder and might of those things
In the sky extending into heaven will be shaken.


26|”Then they’ll see the Man[m] coming in the clouds with great might and glory, 

27|and then he will send the angels and will gather his Chosen Ones from every 
corner of the earth, from one side of the planet to another[n].
          
28|”Learn from the example of the fig tree: when its branches become tender 
and its leaves bud, know that summer is right around the corner. 
29|The same 
thing applies to you: when you finally do see these things taking place, understand that 
it’ll be real soon, as it’s right at your doorstep. 
30|You can count on what I’m telling 
you: that very period in the history of mankind[o] won’t go away until all these things 
come to pass. 
31|The sky and the earth will go away, but my words will never-ever 
go away.
          
32|”But concerning that day and hour (i.e., the exact moment), nobody knows, 
neither the angels in heaven nor the Son—nobody except for the Father. 
33|See that 
you’re ready, since you don’t know what the timeframe[p] will be—
34|like a man 
who’s frequently on the road, who, when leaving home, left his servants in charge of 
each of his various estate shops[q] and commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch[F]. 

35|So now, stay alert[F], since you don’t know when the estate owner will come, 
whether it be at sunset…whether in the middle of the night…whether just before 
daybreak…whether at daybreak[G]. 
36|May he not come all of a sudden and catch 
you all asleep. 
*[a]the sign…Also: the portent; the omen; the supernatural wonder

making, tanneries, potteries, wineries…perhaps herds, fields, silos.
*[r]applies to you as well…Lit: what I’m telling you all, I’m saying to everyone

*[A]I am the one-and-only one…Lit: I am. Same words Jesus spoke in John 8:58, which in turn is a 
repetition of Exod. 3:14. Saying “I am” implies saying “I am the eternal God incarnate.”
*[B]The local council…In this context, though it could refer to the national council (which was like a 
Supreme Court), the Sanhedrin, which in Matthew is called the Council of the Elders, but more likely 
refers to a local tribunal of elders.
*[C]have the one who reads this out loud to the congregation get up to speed on this ahead of time…Ref.

*[F]keep watch…stay alert…stay focused…Lit: keep watch. The GT uses the same word for keep watch at 
the end of v.34 (keep watch), at the beginning of v. 35 (stay alert), and at the end of v. 37 (stay focused). 
*[G]whether at daybreak…The times listed in v.35 (sunset, middle of the night, just before daybreak, 
daybreak) are all times when it is dark or nearly dark and are listed in the order of the Jewish day. In 
other words, since the Jewish day starts at sunset, the hours of darkness or near darkness progress from 
sunset to the middle of the night, just before daybreak, and finally to daybreak. Also, in the GT, Mark 
inserts the word whether before each time…whether at sunset, whether in the middle of the night, 
whether just before daybreak, whether daybreak. His point is to cover the entire night, from beginning 
to end, starting when it begins to get dark and ending when it’s still a bit dark in the morning.
[H]But the point that I’m making in this story applies to you all as well…In this parable, the servants are all 
assigned responsibilities, and their responsibilities by default include keeping watch during the day, as 
they’ll be up and about minding shop during daylight hours, but do not included keeping watch at night. 
The job of keeping the night watch is assigned solely to the doorman. If the estate owner were to come 
in the middle of the night and catch everyone asleep, it will be the doorman’s fault and not the 
servants’, since the servants are expected to sleep at night. The doorman is the lowest ranking servant 
on the estate (the Gk. word for doorman is alternatively translated porter or janitor); the servants are 
assigned more important duties. The doorman’s temptation is to neglect his night watch duties, as the 
servants, those senior to him, will sleep through the night and therefore not keep tabs on him. The 
admonition Jesus makes is for the doorman (and us by extension) to stay alert every night, throughout 
the entire night, as the estate owner could come at any time.

&MARK 14
1|Now in two days the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread was 
scheduled to start. The chief priests and the designated teachers[a] were looking and 
looking for a way to use some sort of trickery to get ahold of him and kill him. 
2|In this 
regard, they kept on saying, “Not in the midst of the festival, lest the people riot.”
          
3|While staying in Bethany, in Simon the leper’s house, while he was sitting at 
the dinner table[b], a woman with a jar of fragrant ointment[c]—the pure, genuine 
expensive stuff—went up to him, cracked[A] the jar open, and poured it all out on his 
head. 
4|Now some of them who were there were furious, complaining amongst 
themselves, “What does her wasting of this ointment accomplish? 
5|The fact is, this 
ointment here could’ve been sold for upwards of $30,000[d], and the proceeds donated to 
the poor.” They were fuming with indignation over her. 
6|But Jesus said, “Leave her 
alone—why are you hassling her? She did me a favor. 
7|You see, you’ll always have 
the poor among you, and whenever you want you can do a kind deed for them, but 
you’ll not always have me around. 
8|She did what she could to embalm[e] my body 
ahead of time as part of the burial mummification. 
9|Mark my words: wherever the 
Good News[f] will be proclaimed—wherever in the whole world—what she did will also 
be talked about in memory of her.”
          
10|Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, left to meet up with the chief priests, in 
order for him to deliver Jesus into their custody. 
11|When they heard the proposal, 
they were delighted and promised to give him a wad of cash[g]. They began to look for 
an opportune moment to apprehend him.
          
12|On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the day when they 
slaughtered the Passover sacrifice, his disciples, querying him, say, “Where do you 
want us to venture out to, to make the arrangements for you to partake of the Passover 
meal?” 
13|He dispatched two of his disciples telling them, “Go into the city, and a 
man carrying a pot of water will encounter you; follow him. 
14|Whatever place he 
happens to enter, say to the owner, ‘The teacher says, where is my dining room, the one 
where I’ll partake of the Passover meal with my disciples?’, 
15|and he personally 
will show you a large, upstairs room with everything spread out and ready, and there 
you’ll make the arrangements for us.” 
16|The disciples departed and went into the 
city and found things to be just like he told them, and they made the Passover meal 
arrangements.
          
17|When it got to be late in the day, he arrived with the Twelve. 

18|While they were dining and relaxing[h], Jesus said, “Mark my words—I’m 
telling you, one of you dining here with me will betray me.” 
19|They became 
deeply upset, and they went on and on, one after another, telling him, “It’s not me.” 

20|But he said, “It’ll be one of the Twelve, one who raises his glass to offer a toast[B]. 

21|And here’s the thing—sure—the Man[i] will follow the trajectory that’s been 
specified by the verses in the Scriptures that talk about him. But on the other hand, bad 
things are in store for the person through whom the Man will be apprehended as a 
result of betrayal; that guy would be better if he’d never been born.”
          
22|While still eating, he took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it[C], gave it 
to them, and said, “Take this. This is my body.” 
23|He took a cup, gave thanks, 
gave it to them, 
24|and said, “This is my blood of the covenant[D], that which is 
poured out on behalf of many. 
25|I’m telling you for certain that I absolutely won’t 
drink from what’s generated from the vineyard[j] until that day when God’s master plan 
manifests (in God’s kingdom) when I’ll drink it afresh.” 
26|After they sang some 
hymns, they left for the Mount of Olives.
          
27|Jesus then says to them, “All of you will fall out[k] with me tonight, because 
it has been recorded in the Scriptures,

“I will strike the shepherd,
And the sheep will scatter all over the place


28|”But never mind that—after my resurrection, I’ll go on out ahead of you to 
Galilee.” 
29|Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else falls out, I won’t, uh-uh.” 

30|Jesus said to him, “I’m telling you for certain that before the rooster crows 
twice, you will have denied me three times.” 
31|All the more vehemently he kept 
on saying, “Even if I have to die with you, I won’t deny you—no way!” The others, one 
after another, were saying the same thing.
          
32|They went to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit 
here until I’m done praying.” 
33|He took along with him Peter, James, and John 
and started to become gripped with agony and consternation. 
34|He, in the midst 
of it, says, “My life-being[l] is pained all throughout in grief to the point of death: stay 
here with me and stay focused.” 
35|He wandered out a bit and fell on the ground 
and began to pray and pray, praying if it’s possible that this hour pass him by. 

36|In the midst of that he was saying, “Abba—my Father—by You, all things are 
possible[m]: let this ordeal pass me by[n]. But in any case, not what I want but what You 
want.”
          
37|He went and found them sleeping and then says to Peter, “Simon, you’re 
asleep? You didn’t have the stamina to focus for one hour? 
38|Evermore stay 
focused in prayer[o], so that you don’t reach the point where trials can break you[p]; 
indeed the spirit is gung-ho[q], but human nature[r] is weak.”
          
39|Again, he went out and prayed the same prayer, 
40|and again he 
found them sleeping; they didn’t know what they would say in response to him since 
their eyelids were sagging[E]. 
41|He came a third time and said to them, “You chose 
to sleep in the interim and get rested up?—The moment has come—here we go[s]: the 
Man is being handed over into the hands of sinners. 
42|Get up, let’s go; look—the 
one facilitating my arrest has arrived.”
          
43|Right away, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, 
showed up with a large party armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests, 
designated teachers, and councilmen[t]. 
44|His betrayer had set up a signal ahead of 
time, saying, “Whomever I greet with a kiss, seize him, secure him, and take him 
away.” 
45|He went straight over to him and then says, “Teacher[u],” and kissed him 
cordially. 
46|They laid their hands on him and grabbed ahold of him. 
47|One 
of the men standing there with Jesus (and who was one of his associates, supporters, and 
defenders) unsheathed a sword, attacked the chief priest’s slave, and sliced off his ear. 

48|Jesus considered what had happened and said to the party[F], “So you came out 
to seize me with swords and clubs, like you’re pouncing on a thug? 
49|Day by day, 
I was at the same place you were at in the temple complex teaching, and you didn’t grab 
me? Anyways—this happened in order to fulfill the Scriptures.” 
50|Everyone who 
was standing there with[F] Jesus deserted him and began to flee. 
51|A certain young 
man[G] (a teenager) tagged along behind him, clothed only in a linen garment around his 
private parts. They grabbed him, 
52|but he shed the garment they grabbed and ran 
away naked.[H]
          
53|They took Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the 
councilmen, and the designated teachers gathered together there. 
54|Peter 
followed him from a distance, until he was within the courtyard of the chief priest’s 
domicile, and he took a seat alongside the attendants, warming himself up next to the fire 
used as the light source. 
55|Now the chief priests and all the councilmen were trying 
to find someone to testify under oath[v] against Jesus in order to sentence him to death, 
but they weren’t having any success finding anyone. 
56|To that ends, many were 
saying phony things against him in court under oath, but the testimonies weren’t 
compelling. 
57|Some of the ones taking the witness stand and testifying against 
him were saying, 
58|”We personally heard him say, ‘I’ll tear down this man-made 
temple myself, and in three days I’ll build another one, one that’s not man-made’,” 

59|but this testimony wasn’t adequate enough to produce a guilty verdict either. 

60|The high priest stood up in front of everyone and, by means of inquiry, asked 
Jesus, “You don’t have anything to say in response to those who’ve testified against 
you?” 
61|He kept silent and wouldn’t say anything in response. Again, the high 
priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Christ, the Blessed Son?”, 
62|and he 
said, “I am the one-and-only one[w]. And,

“You will see the Man[i]
In his role as a powerful right-hand man[x]
Coming with the clouds of the sky”

          
63|Then the high priest became unglued and in a rage starting breaking 
things,[y] all the while saying, “What further testimony do we need? 
64|You all 
heard the blasphemy; what’s it looking like to you?” So everyone there sentenced him to 
death. 
65|Some of them began to go about spitting on him, blindfolding him, and 
striking him, saying to him, “Prophesy.” And then the attendants took him and slapped 
him around.
          
66|Being outside in the courtyard, Peter was approached by one of the high 
priest’s servant girls. 
67|She saw Peter warming himself up, took a good hard look 
at him, and then says to him, “You too were with Jesus of Nazareth.” 
68|He denied 
it, saying, “I have no first-hand knowledge or understanding of what you’re saying,” 
and he left the courtyard to go out to the porch. A rooster crowed.[I] 
69|While 
looking at him, the servant girl began talking to the bystanders again, “This guy’s one 
of them.” 
70|He denied it again. Again, a bit later, the bystanders were saying to 
Peter, “Seriously—you’re one of them, since you’re a Galilean.” 
71|He began to 
cuss repeatedly and to swear by oaths, “I don’t know this person, whomever it is that 
you’re talking about.” 
*[a]designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes

*[i]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[j]what’s generated from the vineyard…Lit: from the produce of the vineyard. Saying this instead of simply 
saying wine is a figure of speech.
*[k]fall out…Or: do wrong; falls apart; messes up; fall away; fall prey to a trap; fall short; make a mistake; 
get off over into a ditch. Ref. note of Matt. 26:31.
*[l]life-being…Lit: soul
*[m]all things are possible…Same wording as in Matt. 19:26, All things are possible with God
*[n]let this ordeal pass me by…Lit: bear this cup past and away from me
*[o]evermore stay focused in prayer…Lit: watch and pray. Wording it this way instead of pray watchfully is 
a figure of speech. And also, the word watch in this context means focus. And also, the word evermore 
amplifies the verb tense in watch and pray.
*[p]reach the point where trials can break you…Lit: so that you won’t come into temptation. Temptation 
here is testing to the breaking point, in addition to its commonly-understood meaning.
*[q]is gung-ho…Also: all for it; desires it passionately
*[r]human nature…Lit: the flesh. Impl. the carnal nature present in every person.
*[s]here we go…Lit: behold
*[t]councilmen…Lit: the elders. Impl. the Sanhedrin.
*[u]Teacher…Lit: Rabbi. Using the affectionate form (ref. Mark 10:51) for the word teacher, this could 
more accurately be rendered, beloved teacher.

*[x]In his role as a powerful right-hand man…Lit: Sitting at the right-hand of power
*[y]became unglued and in a rage starting breaking things…Lit: So the high priest tore his cloak. Some 
liberties taken; Ref. note of Matt. 26:65.

*[A]cracked…Lit: break; shatter; crush. What Mark is conveying is the tearing or breaking of an expensive 
seal, elaborate packaging, or a one-time breaking of some sort of container. Just as it is today, expensive 
items back then came with elaborate seals, not just simple lids. The manufacturer of an expensive item 
will purposely intend the breaking open of such a container to become a pleasing ritual and a means of 
fueling the hype and anticipation of discovering its contents.
*[B]one who raises his glass to offer a toast…Lit: dips in the dish with me. Some liberties taken; ref. note of 
Matt. 26:23.
*[C]took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it…Breaking of bread was a ritual; ref. note of Matt. 14:19.
*[D]This is my blood of the covenant…Some of the older manuscripts have an alternate reading, this is my 
blood which is of the covenant, while others read, this is my blood of the new covenant. The evidence for 
the accepted reading is sufficient to accept what’s rendered here as genuine. It remains for us to accept 
what Jesus said at face value.
*[E]and again he found them sleeping; they didn’t know what they would say in response to him since their 
eyelids were sagging…Lit: And again he found them sleeping, since their eyelids were sagging, and they 
didn’t know how they might reply to him. They were sleeping because they didn’t know how to reply to 
Jesus?—An example of Mark’s clumsy writing.
*[F](V.48) said to the party…(v.50) everyone standing there…Lit: said to them (v.48); all of them (v.50). It’s 
known by the context what the antecedent of them is in both cases, but the potential for ambiguity 
would otherwise exist. Another example of Mark’s clumsy writing.
*[G]A certain young man…Some assert that the “certain young man” referred to in v.51 is none other than 
Mark himself. At a minimum, Mark’s book is worded in such a way that the reader would understand 
who he was talking about. Patching together NT verses here and there and also church tradition, Mark 
was the son of Mary, who owned the upper room where the Last Supper was held. Mark wasn’t one of 
Jesus’s disciples, either because he was too young to be so, didn’t know him until the Passover week, or 
both; but he followed Jesus and the Twelve Disciples after they left the upper room to Gethsemane.
*[H]but he shed the garment they grabbed and ran away naked…From the sounds of it, when those in the 
party tried to grab ahold of the young man, they could just barely get ahold of him. They weren’t able to 
arms, legs, neck, or grab him around his waist; all they could do is get a hand on his linen garment. He 
squirmed, the loin cloth came off, and he continued to bolt. This probably would’ve taken place in just a 
few seconds.
*[I]a rooster crowed (v.68)…a rooster crowed a second time (v.72)…These words are missing from a few of 
the most reliable manuscripts. It’s possible that others added what Mark in his clumsiness neglected. 
[J]it hit him like a ton of bricks…Lit: Having thrown upon, he started crying. The single Gk. word epiballō 
(ἐπιβάλλω /Strong’s 1911). Apparently an idiom of some sort; it’s not entirely certain what the exact 
meaning of this is when used as an idiom. Some translators render it, He broke down and cried.

remembered the statement which Jesus made, that before a rooster crows twice, you 
will have denied me three times. It hit him like a ton of bricks,[J] and he started crying.


&MARK 15
1|Without delay, late in the night the chief priests, along with all the 
councilmen and the designated teachers[a], convened a meeting, bound Jesus, carried 
him away, and delivered him into Pilate’s custody. 
2|Pilate asked him, “You’re the 
king of the Jews?” He answered him, “Whatever you say[b].” 
3|The chief priests 
accused him of many things. 
4|Again, Pilate asked him, “You’re not going to say 
anything in response? Take a look at how many accusations they’ve leveled against 
you.” 
5|But to Pilate’s astonishment, Jesus didn’t have anything more to say.
          
6|He had an ongoing tradition, done at each festival, of releasing one prisoner 
for them, whomever they’d ask for. 
7|There was one called Barabbas who had been 
imprisoned along with the revolutionaries[A], in particular those who had committed 
murder during the insurrection[A]. 
8|The crowd came over and initiated making the 
request, in accordance with his usual practice. 
9|Pilate responded to them, “Do you 
want me to set the king of the Jews free?”, 
10|since he was aware that the chief 
priests had him arrested out of envy. 
11|Now, the chief priests had whipped the 
crowd into a frenzy, in order that their preference would be to release Barabbas.
          
12|Again, Pilate responded to them,
      “So now, what do you want me to do with the one who’s called the King of the 
Jews?”
          
13|Again, they shouted, “Crucify him!”
          
14|Pilate said to them multiple times, “…Because he’s done what wrong?”
      But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”
          
15|Intending to placate the crowd, Pilate set Barabbas free and handed over 
Jesus, after he had him flogged, to be crucified.
          
16|The soldiers led him away to a courtyard inside the compound, the one 
used by the governor’s security guards[c], and called over the entire company of guards. 

17|They clothed him in a robe a nobleman would wear[B] and placed on[d] him a 
crown, a wreath woven from thorns. 
18|They began to go about greeting him, 
“Pleased to meet you[e] King of the Jews.” 
19|They kept on hitting him on the head 
with a rod, spitting on him, and getting on their knees in an act of subservience to him. 

20|When they finished ridiculing him, they took the robe off and put his clothes 
back on him, and they led him away to be crucified[f].
          
21|They pressed into service a random passerby, Simon of Cyrene (the one 
who’s the father of Alexander and Rufus), who happened to be coming in from working out 
in the fields, to carry[g] his cross. 
22|They brought him up on top of[h] the place called 
Golgotha, which translated means “Skull Place.” 
23|They kept on trying to give 
him spiced[C] wine, but he wouldn’t take it. 
24|They crucified him and divvied up 
his clothing, rolling dice[i] to see who was going to get to take it away. 
          
25|Now it was mid-morning[D] when they performed the crucifixion on 
him.[j] 
26|There was a sign stating the reason why he was crucified, and it read, “The 
king of the Jews.” 
27|They crucified two thugs with him, together as a group, one 
to the left of him and one to the right of him[k]. 
28|[l] 
29|Those who passed by 
reviled him, nodding their heads left and right saying, “Ah! The one who’ll supposedly 
destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days— 
30|Save yourself: come down off 
that cross.” 
31|In the same way, the chief priests and the designated teachers[m], 
going back and forth with each other making fun of him, in the midst of that were 
saying, “He went and rescued others, but he cannot save himself. 
32|The Messiah, 
the Christ, the King of Israel: let him come down from the cross now, so that we would 
see and believe.” Even his fellow crucifixion-mates kept on taunting him.
          
33|When it got to be noon[D], darkness appeared over the entire planet until 
late afternoon[D], 
34|and in the late afternoon[D], Jesus shouted in a loud voice, “Eloi, 
eloi, lema sabachthani?”, which is translated, “My God, my God, why have you 
abandoned me?” 
35|Some of the bystanders heard this and started saying, “Look, 
he’s calling on Elijah.” 
36|Someone ran and soaked a sponge in a mixture of water 
and vinegar that the soldiers commonly drank, put it on a rod, and proceeded to offer it 
to him to drink, saying, “Let’s see if Elijah comes and takes him down from off the 
cross,” 
37|but Jesus let out a great cry and passed away[n], 
38|and the temple 
curtain[o] was torn in two from top to bottom. 
39|Seeing this, the army captain 
standing across from him said, “This man really was the embodiment of a son[p] of 
God.” 
40|Now there were also women watching at a distance, among whom 
were[q] Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, 

41|those women who were ever his followers and were constantly attending to his 
needs when he was in Galilee, and many other women who accompanied him to 
Jerusalem.
          
42|It had gotten to be late, and since it was a preparatory day (that is, a pre-
feast day or pre-Sabbath preparatory day[E]), 
43|Joseph of Arimathea, an influential 
councilman, who also was himself a true believer,[r] got up the courage, entered Pilate’s 
compound, and went up to Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. 
44|But Pilate 
wondered if he had in fact died already, and summoned the captain and asked him if it 
had been a while since he died[s]. 
45|Getting up to speed with the captain, he 
presented the body to Joseph as a gift, 
46|and Joseph purchased a cloth sheet made 
of linen and used for wrapping, took him down, rolled him up in the sheet, put him in a 
tomb, one which had been hewn out of a rock formation, and rolled a stone over the 
tomb’s entrance. 
*[a]the high priests, along with all the councilmen and the designated teachers…Lit: the high priests with 
the elders, the scribes, and the entire Sanhedrin
*[b]Whatever you say…Lit: You say
*[c]the governor’s security guards…Lit: the praetorian. Similar to the Roman Praetorian Guard but applied 
to the governor’s (Pilate’s) palace.
*[d]placed on him…Lit: placed around him. The use of the word around instead of on, and the fact that the 
word for crown here is something similar to a Roman laurel wreath indicates that the crown indeed was 
just like we see in the pictures and movies about Jesus.
*[e]Pleased to meet you, King of the Jews…Lit: Joy, King of the Jews
*[f]they led him away to be crucified…Lit: they led him out in order that they might crucify him
*[g]to carry…Lit: to take up. The Gk. word rendered carry in v.21 is the same word used in Matt. 16:24 (to 
take up).
*[h]up on top of…Or: to the exact location of; to
*[i]rolling dice…Some liberty taken; they cast lots instead of rolling dice.
*[j]Now it was mid-morning when they performed the crucifixion on him…Lit: Now it was the third hour 
and they crucified him. The two thoughts (#1: it was the third hour; #2: they crucified him) separated by 
the word and rather than combining them is a figure of speech.
*[k]one to the left of him and one to the right of him…Also: one at his left hand and one at his right hand
*[l]Verse 28 which reads, And the Scripture which says, “And he was counted with lawless men,” is 
spurious and therefore omitted.
*[m]designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes
*[n]let out a great cry and passed away…Lit: he exhaled, or, his spirit went out of him
*[o]temple curtain…Ref. note of Matt. 27:52
*[p]a son…The rendering a son should not insinuate that the Son of God is one of many sons of God. The 
GT does not say that.
*[q]among whom were…The GT includes a leading and to the list of women, and this and, though omitted 
in the rendering, seems to imply that all the women who were watching from a distance are listed in 
vv.40,41; that there were no other women present.
*[r]who also was himself a true believer…Lit: who also was personally receiving to himself the kingdom of 
God
*[s]if it had been a while since he died…some of the older manuscripts instead read, if he had died.

*[A]along with the revolutionaries…during the insurrection…As v.8 is worded in the GT, the revolutionaries 
and the insurrection refer to a specific group of insurgents and a specific rebellion, lost to history 
perhaps, but known to Mark’s readers.
*[B]a robe a nobleman would wear…The Gk. word prophyra (πορφύρα/Strong’s 4209). It means two 
things: it means purple and it also refers to the Murex snail from which purple dye is extracted. In 
modern times, dyes are synthesized at a low cost from chemical compounds, and so there is an 
abundance of cheap, multi-colored clothing. In ancient times only by harvesting Murex snails from the 
ocean could one produce a purple dye, so the clothing made from this dye was expensive. Since only the 
wealthy nobles could afford it, purple coloring was associated with nobility.
*[C]spiced wine…Lit: myrrh-mixed wine. Also ref. Matt. 27:34, Ps. 69:21. Roman soldiers normally drank a 
wine which was at least partly vinegar; the sour taste helped quench one’s thirst, something like putting 
a slice of lemon in a glass of iced tea. Obviously, however, too much vinegar would make the drink 
unpalatable, and apparently they mixed myrrh to limit the extent to which the wine degraded into 
vinegar, as it would naturally do so when exposed to the air. But the myrrh was also slightly narcotic, 
and Jesus apparently refuses it so that the wine won’t ameliorate his suffering.
*[D]mid-morning…noon…late afternoon…Mid-morning in the GT is the third hour. The Jewish regular hours 
of prayer and of sacrifices instituted the third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day. Out of this, the third, 
sixth, and ninth hours became the way of specifying approximate points during the day (ref. Matt. 20:1–
17), and they correspond to what we call mid-morning, noon, middle of the afternoon, and late 
afternoon. In spite of the fact that they are numerical values in a twelve hour day, they are not as exact 
as their nominal values suggest.
[E]a pre-Sabbath preparatory day…The Sabbath here could be either a Saturday or a feast day. Naturally, 
one would want to remove dead bodies immediately; furthermore, dead bodies should not remain on 
the Sabbath. Work was forbidden on the Sabbath, not to mention the aversion and restrictions the Jews 
had concerning dead bodies.

47|Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were

&MARK 16
1|After sundown, just after the Sabbath restrictions came to a close[a], Mary 
Magdalene, Mary mother of James, and Salome bought fragrant spices in order to go and 
apply to his body, covering it all over. 
2|Very early on Sunday morning[b], when the 
sun had just risen, they went to the tomb. 
3|They were repeatedly saying amongst 
themselves, “Who’s going to roll the stone back away from the entrance of the tomb?”, 

4|and they all at once looked up and observed that the stone had been rolled away (it 
was simply enormous, you see). 
5|They came to the tomb and saw a man who looked 
to be in his late teens or early twenties sitting off to the right wearing a long white robe, 
and they were startled out of their wits. 
6|But he then tells them, “Don’t be startled. 
Jesus of Nazareth who had been crucified has been resurrected; he’s not here—take a 
look at the place where they put him. 
7|In any event, go your way and tell his 
disciples—and Peter[A]—that he’s heading out before them to Galilee. They’ll see him 
there, just like he told them they would.” 
8|They exited the tomb and began to run 
away like mad, since they were in a state of shock and were shaking all over. They 
didn’t say anything to anyone, since they were still too terrified to do so.
          
9|[B]After he had been resurrected early Sunday morning, he appeared first to 
Mary Magdalene, whom he had cast out seven demons out of. 
10|That lady went 
and told the news to those who had been mourning and weeping with her, 
11|and 
those who heard that he’s alive and that he had been seen by her refused to believe it[c].
          
12|Now after these appearances, he appeared in a different form to two of 
them while they were going out to the countryside, 
13|and those very people went 
away and told everyone else—they didn’t believe those people either.
          
14|Now last of all he appeared to the Eleven while they were relaxing taking 
a meal, and he chewed them out for their refusal to believe[c] and for their hardness of 
heart, because they didn’t believe those who had beheld him resurrected. 
15|He 
said to them, “Go into all the inhabited world[d] and preach a complete round[e] of the 
Good News[f] to anything that has two legs[g]. 
16|He who has believed and has been 
baptized will be kept from destruction[h], but he who has refused to believe[c] will be 
condemned. 
17|These supernatural signs will accompany[i] those who have 
believed: by my authority[j] they will cast out demons; they will speak tongues which 
are new, never-heard-before languages; 
18|they will remove serpents, taking them 
out of the way;[k] and if they were to drink something poisonous, it will certainly not 
harm them; they’ll lay hands on the sick and sickly, and they’ll get well.”
          
19|So then the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into the sky 
and assumed his position as God’s chief executive[l]. 
*[a]just after the Sabbath restrictions came to a close…The Jewish day ended at sundown, so the Sabbath 
ended at sundown. Once the Sabbath was over, the women could conduct business.
*[b]Very early on Sunday morning…Lit: very early in the first of the Sabbaths (v.2). Ref. Matt. 28:1 for 
“Sabbaths” use in plural. The “first of the Sabbaths” is a Sunday; also ref. John 2:1; Acts 20:7 Related to 
this, v.9 reads lit.: now having been resurrected early on the first of the Sabbath…
*[c]refusal to believe…refused to believe…Lit: unbelief
*[d]the inhabited world…Lit: the world. Refers to the people who live on the earth, rather than the earth 
per se.
*[e]preach a complete round…This is the word preach in the aorist tense, not the expected present tense. 
The use of aorist over present tense views the proclamation of the gospel as a one-time event, rather 
than a never-ending series of proclamations. The one-time preaching of the gospel views takes all the 
individual proclamations and views them as a single set. In other words, make sure everyone gets to 
hear it at least once.
*[f]the Good News…Lit: the Gospel
*[g]anything that has two legs…Lit: all of creation. This is a figure of speech, as Jesus isn’t commanding the 
disciples to preach to dogs or mountains or such.
*[h]kept from destruction…Lit: saved
*[i]accompany…Lit: follow alongside
*[j]by my authority…Lit: in my name. Ref. note of Acts 4:7.
*[k]they will remove serpents, taking them out of the way…Also: they will lift up serpents. Some 
manuscripts read, they will lift up serpents with their hands, appending the words with their hands. The 
word used for lift up here is translated various ways depending on context.
*[l]assumed his position as God’s chief executive…Lit: sat at the right hand of God

*[A]tell his disciples and Peter…If there’s any doubt that Mark was close to Peter, remarks such as these 
should lay that doubt to rest. In multiple places Mark points Peter out, mentioning what he’s doing. 
Furthermore, he often uses the name Peter, the one given to him by Jesus, instead of ones that others 
called him, Simon or Cephas.
[B]Those who deny that vv. 9–20 are genuine build their argument not on the manuscript evidence 
(which is certainly not in their favor) but instead on “internal” evidence, i.e. whether they think these 
verses fit Mark’s style of writing and his use of vocabulary. Their claims:
(a) Mary Magdalene, whom he had cast out seven demons (v.9). They claim that the writer is introducing 
Mary Magdalene here, noting the demons cast out of her, but in fact she had been referred to just a few 
times in the preceding verses and chapters.
(b) Some words occur in this passage that Mark doesn’t use anywhere else
(c) The writing is simply not Mark’s style
Let us look at these claims in detail.
First, Mark mentions that Mary Magdalene had had seven demons cast out of her. Any forger would 
know that Mary Magdalene was brought up in v.1 and would’ve written accordingly. But the extra 
statement of her having demons cast out is not an introduction but a reminder of the grace she had 
received, resulting in a tender heart which caused her to be the first to believe when the others 
wouldn’t. To emphasize this, Mark, when he said had cast out, chose to use the Gk. perfect tense over 
the aorist for emphasis. In support of this, v.10 begins with the words that lady, which invites the reader 
to detach himself and ponder her history. The other women weren’t address in that fashion.
Second, there are a few words which Mark uses in this passage that don’t appear elsewhere in his book 
(never mind the fact that every chapter of Mark has unique words used in its chapter which Mark uses 
nowhere else). Let us look at these words:
(i)	Accompany (v.17). This is a more specific word that pre-pends the word with to follow. 
Certainly Mark knew the meaning of this word.
(ii)	Serpent (v.18). A common word.
(iii)	Hurt (v.18). Ranks 2808th out of 5394, where 1 is most common and 5394 is least. This word 
is uncommon.
(iv)	Poison (v.18). Derived from a very common root.
(v)	The phrase so then (v. 19). Two extremely common words used as a phrase. Mark certainly 
knew the meaning of the phrase, but didn’t use it anywhere else.
(vi)	Working alongside (v.20). This is the verb form of the commonly-used noun fellow-worker.
(vii)	Confirm (v.20). Appears as 2803rd out of 5394. This word is uncommon and is not derived 
from a commonly used root.
We can strike serpent, hurt, and poison from the list, since there are no alternatives for these words; 
Mark would’ve asked the scribe who was doing the actual writing to supply these words had he not 
known them and when he had need of them. This leaves four words, three of which are common, and 
Mark certainly knew, but he hadn’t used before. The list of uncommon words is whittled down to the 
single word confirm.
As far as the style is concerned—and this is quite open-ended—true, Mark shifts his preference in verb 
tenses around, but this passage has little story-telling narrative. Another thing to note are the figures of 
speech used in vv.15,16. Would a forgerer risk using a figure or speech? Would a forgerer dwell on the 
disciples not believing when they should have (vv.13,14). While all these things with style are debatable, 
they are not definitive in determining whether the long ending of vv.9–20 is spurious or not.


The Gospel of Luke
       Luke, the beloved physician (Col . 4:14), the faithful companion of Paul, is the author of one of 
the four officially-sponsored Gospels. We assume that Paul authorized Luke to write it, and since it was 
associated with Paul, it’s target audience was the gentile church, more specifically the Christians planted 
by Paul’s ministry. Evidence points to Luke being a slave or a freedman, serving or having served one 
Theophilus, for whose benefit he writes not only the Gospel of Luke but its sequel, the Book of Acts.
       The facts Luke recorded in his Gospel were obtained from him conducting first-hand interviews 
(he says this in 1:2) with many eyewitnesses to the ministry of Jesus. To do this, Luke would have had to 
have spent a few months in Israel, and would have spoken directly with Mary the mother of Jesus and 
recorded her very words in order to obtain such precise details of Jesus’s birth. The likely time of his 
doing these interviews would have been around AD 55, when Paul was in Israel during his third 
missionary journey. Had it been any later than this, these eyewitnesses would have been deceased 
already, not to speak of the sack of Jerusalem in AD 70.
       Luke was thorough and meticulous. He was likely a native Greek speaker; his command of Greek 
surpasses Matthew’s, Mark’s, and John’s by a large measure, and is only rivaled by Paul’s and by those 
who wrote the epistles of Jude and Hebrews. Luke has full command of the nuanced richness of the 
Greek language, and he can capture in a word or a word inflection something which takes an entire 
phrase to render in English.
       Though Luke has the education and intelligence to write complex, sophisticated passages—
which he does in Luke 1:1–4—he refrains from doing so and writes in a down-to-earth manner 
throughout his book. From time to time, he dresses up a sentence or two, using colorful wording where 
more straightforward wording would suffice. An example is Luke 7:1; another example is Luke 8:15 
“beautiful and morally good;” another example is the simile of Luke 22:44, where Luke compares Jesus 
sweat to drops of blood. But throughout the book, he is mindful of detail and correctness, as what he 
writes must reflect what the eyewitnesses told him in face-to-face interviews. In the example of the 
Pharisee and the tax collector praying at the temple (Luke 18:11,13), Luke says that both stood, but uses 
a different form of the same verb to stand, subtlety conveying the difference in their standing postures. 
Moreover in 18:13, Luke’s prose garnishes the story beautifully (literal rendering): “But the tax collector 
standing at a distance was not wanting neither to lift up the eyes to heaven.” Luke is sparing in his use of 
special forms and expressions, but by being sparing when he does use special forms, his usage is more 
effective. For example, in Luke 17:37, Luke uses the present tense to mean the past tense—he does not 
do that often, like in the other Gospels.
       Of the four Gospels, Luke captures the most sober and chilling warnings of the judgment to 
come: do the right thing or pay for it later, even if the payment might be deferred to the life to come. 
Some examples of this are as follows. Luke 12:20: “Fool—the Grim Reaper is coming for you this very 
night. Now everything you saved away: who’s it going to go to?” Luke 13:8,9: “The gardener considered 
things and replied, ‘Boss, leave it be this year as well; meanwhile, I’ll dig around it and put down 
fertilizer, and we’ll see if it produces figs in the coming year. But if it doesn’t, you can cut it down.” Luke 
13:27,28: “Get away from me, the lot of you, practitioners of wrong-doing.’ There will be the weeping 
and the gnashing of teeth, at that time when Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets connected 
with God’s involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) will be seen. Those people, though, get the 
boot.” Luke 14:24: “I’ll tell you this much: not a single one of those people who were invited will taste 
even a morsel of my dinner.” The rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16). Luke 19:27: “However, my enemies, 
those who didn’t want me to rule over them as their king, bring them here and slay them right in front 
of me.”

20|But those very disciples went 
out and preached everywhere, the Lord working alongside and cooperating with them 
like a fellow-worker, and the message kept on being confirmed, established, and made 
certain by means of the supernatural signs following happening right there on the spot, 
right on their heels.


&LUKE 1
1|In light of the fact that many have attempted[A] to compose a narrative 
concerning the deeds which have been carried out to fulfillment among us, 
2|and to 
record it in the same way that they—those from the get-go who became eye-witnesses 
and custodians of the entire affair—delivered and entrusted it to us, 
3|it seemed like a 
good idea for me to follow up after them and write something for you, something that 
starts from the very beginning and which is completely accurate and in sequential 
order, Lord Theophilus[B], 
4|so that you would become thoroughly acquainted with the 
affairs which you’ve learned by word of mouth, and that you would know them with 
certainty.
          
5|It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of the Jews, that there was a certain 
priest named Zechariah, from the Order of Abijah, and he had a wife who was of the 
priestly caste[C]—and her name was Elizabeth. 
6|Both of them were righteous in the 
sight of God, their conduct, from God’s perspective, was that they complied with[a] all 
the commandments and expectations of correct behavior. 
7|They had no children, 
because Elizabeth[C] couldn’t have any children, and both were now elderly.
          
8|Now during his priestly order’s timeslot in the rotation schedule, he 
happened to be the one performing the priestly duties in the holy presence of God[D] 

9|(the appointment being determined according to the priests’ tradition of rolling dice[b]), 
having entered into the temple sanctuary itself[D] to light the incense; 
10|and 
everyone who was in the multitude, a multitude of the folk-people, was outside praying 
during the hour of the incense lighting ritual. 
11|So now, an angel sent from the 
Lord appeared to him standing to the right of the Altar of Incense. 
12|Looking at 
the angel, Zechariah became disturbed, and fear fell upon him. 
13|The angel said to 
him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah; you see, your prayer has been taken to heart, and your 
wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you’ll name him John. 
14|He’ll be a cause 
of joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
15|Indeed, he’ll be 
used mightily by the Lord[c] and won’t drink wine or liquor—absolutely won’t—and 
he’ll be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb, 
16|and many 
native Israelites will heed[d] the Lord their God. 
17|The Lord will use him as a 
herald in a spirit and power the likeness of which Elijah had[E], to soften[e] the hearts of 
the fathers towards the children, and the skeptics and the disobedient[f] to the sensibility 
of the ways of the righteous, to bring about a fully-refined people for the Lord[g].” 

18|Zechariah said to the angel, “Just how will the realization of these things come 
to me? The fact is, I’m old, and my wife is well-past her prime.” 
19|The angel 
replied, “I am the high-ranking angel Gabriel: the one who stands in the presence of God. 
Concerning these things, He sent me to speak to you and deliver the good news. 

20|See here now—you will remain silent, unable to speak, until the time comes that 
these things come to pass, as a consequence of you not having believed my words, 
which will be fulfilled in the course of good time.”
          
21|The people were expecting Zechariah to have come out already and were 
baffled at how long a time he was spending in the temple. 
22|When he came out, 
he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he’d seen a vision while inside 
the temple. He was gesturing to them, all the while remaining mute. 
23|When his 
order’s timeslot for priestly service was up, he left to go back home. 
24|Some time 
afterwards, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and during the five months that she was 
keeping herself in seclusion, she kept on saying, 
25|”All this because the Lord 
wanted things to turn out for me in a way that would remove my shame in the eyes of 
others[F].”
          
26|Now in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy[h], God sent the angel 
Gabriel to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, 
27|to a young, never-married woman[i] 
engaged to a man named Joseph, who was a direct descendant of David—and the name 
of this young woman was Mary. 
28|He entered the physical world right in front of 
her and said, 
      “Greetings[j], favored-one[k], the Lord be with you.” 
29|Now she was deeply 
disturbed at the remark and was trying to figure out what the nature of the visit would 
be. 
30|The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary; the fact is, you’ve found favor 
with God. 
31|See here now—you’ll conceive and give birth to a son, and you’ll 
name him ‘Jesus.’ 
32|He’ll be capable, noteworthy, and accomplished[l] and will be 
called a son[m] of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor 
David, 
33|and he’ll reign forever over the Israeli people, and his kingdom will 
never come to an end.” 
          
34|Mary said to the angel, “How will this come about, since I don’t have a 
husband with whom to be intimate?”
       
35|The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the 
miraculous power of the Most High will engulf you. For this reason, the one you’re 
giving birth to is holy, and he’ll be called a son of God. 
36|Take a look—in her old 
age, your relative Elizabeth—even she—is pregnant with a son; the one everyone took 
for granted was infertile[n]—this is her sixth month of pregnancy. 
37|You see, with 
God, all things are possible[o].”
          
38|Mary said, “I present myself as the servant of the Lord. Let things come 
to pass with regard to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.
          
39|During this time, Mary took a trip into the hill country, to a town in 
Judea. 
40|She entered Zechariah’s house and was welcomed enthusiastically by 
Elizabeth. 
41|It so happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby 
leaped in her womb; Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, 
42|and with a great 
cry uttered back, “You in particular among women be blessed, (that is, the recipient of good 
things); and blessed be, (that is, let the pronouncement of goodness be over), the produce of 
your womb. 
43|How did I get such an honor, that the mother of my Lord would 
come to visit me? 
44|In fact—get this—the moment the sound of your greeting 
entered my ear, the baby I’m carrying leaped in exultation. 
45|She who believed is 
blessed, because it will be a realization of those things which have been spoken to her 
and established from the Lord.”
          
46|And Mary said,


47|”My life-being[p] extols the Lord
And my spirit has heaped exultation upon God my Savior[G]

48|Because He took interest in the abasement of his slave.
Yes indeed—and—hey—from now on
All generations will call me blessed

49|Because he has done great things for me, the Capable One,
And holy is His name[G],

50|And His mercy is directed[G] towards those
Who have a deep reverence[q] for Him.
For generation upon generation

51|The One exuding power intervened
In the affairs of man[G] and did this:
He[G] routed[G][r] those who are high-and-mighty
Where the intention of their heart is concerned[G].

52|He pulled down rulers from their thrones
And exalted the abased.

53|From out of good things He filled the hungry up,
And He punted the rich,
Sending them away empty-handed.

54|He took the responsibility of caring for Israel, his child,
To take heed and remember mercy,

55|In accordance to what he said to our ancestors,
To Abraham and to his descendants until the end of time.”

          
56|Mary remained with her for three months and set out for the return trip 
back home. 
57|Now Elizabeth’s due-date arrived, and she gave birth to a son. 

58|Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord showered tremendous mercy 
on her and rejoiced with her joy and congratulated her. 
59|When the eighth day 
after birth came, they went to circumcise the child, and they were thinking of naming 
him after his father Zechariah. 
60|His mother spoke up and said,
      “No—he’ll be named John instead.”
          
61|They told her, “You don’t have any relatives who go by that name.”
          
62|They started gesturing to his father what he might possibly want to name 
him. 
63|He asked for a chalkboard[r] and wrote, “His name will be[s] John.”
      Everyone was taken back: 
64|he immediately regained his ability to talk, 
and he began speaking, uttering praises to God. 
65|A deep reverence came over all 
his neighbors, and the whole hill country of Judea kept on talking about all these 
matters; 
66|the reports settled deep in the heart of everyone who heard them: they 
were saying, “What will come of this child as a result?” The fact is, God was directing 
the course of his life.[t]
          
67|Zechariah, his father, was filled with[u] the Holy Spirit and prophesied,


68|Blessed is the Lord God of Israel,
Because He showed up and did a spiritual service for His people

69|And got a horn ready, a horn
Which signals security and the end to our misery[v],
Ready to blow, to be a cue for us
By means of the lineage of David, His son

70|In accordance to what He spoke
Through the mouth of the holy people who lived long ago
Prophesying about him from the beginning of time:


71|”Security and the end to our misery from our enemies
And from the ability of those who hate us to do us harm:

72|To perform an act of mercy in the company of our ancestors
And to remember His holy covenant,

73|An oath which He swore to our ancestor Abraham:

74|The promise to grant us bold raid-and-rescue operations
To get us out from the clutches[w] of our enemies;
To be continuously holding worship services dedicated to Him

75|In piety, holiness, and correctness
In His midst for all the days of our lives.”


76|Now you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High
You see, you’re destined to be a trailblazer for the Lord
To prepare the road that he’ll take

77|To impart to his people
The comprehension of their security and of an end to their misery
By means of the forgiveness of their sins

78|Through deep, heartfelt mercies from our God,
By which mercies a sunrise to noon-like epoch will come visit us,

79|To shine upon those in darkness,
Upon those sitting under a death-shadow[x],
To put us on the path to peace[y].

          
*[a]righteous in the sight of God, their conduct, from God’s perspective, was that they complied with…Lit: 
righteous in the presence of God, walking blamelessly before the Lord. This sort of wording is 
commonplace in the OT.

Jewish calendar is the month of Elul, which is August or September.
*[i]young, never-married woman…Lit: virgin

Matt 26:49, Mark 15:8, Acts 23:26.

darkness and to those sitting in a shadow of death. A figure of speech: the joining of two redundant 
clauses, and the joining of them with the conjunction and. Also, ref. Matt. 4:16.
*[y]To put us on the path to peace…Lit: To straighten our feet unto a road of peace. A biblical idiom.

*[A]many have attempted…In these first few verses, Luke alludes to the fact that many have attempted to 
create a written record of the life of Jesus but did a mediocre job of it. He’s not referring to the Gnostic 
Gospels or some other heretical works, but to a few Christians who made early attempts to create what 
we now know as the Gospels but whose workmanship was a failure. Luke says here that he’ll correctly 
the problem and write his account accurately. Luke, the man of learning that he was, was versed in the 
correct method of writing history, the theory of which had been formulated by the first century. This 
passage gives us valuable insight into the formation of the four Gospels. None of the four were 
haphazardly written, all four gained the approval of the church leadership, and the “many” that Luke 
refers to in v.1 were rejected because they didn’t live up the standards set by the four that have been 
handed down through the ages. The four gospels were sponsored, by the church, approved by the 
church, and propagated by the church.
To achieve the self-set goals Luke stated in vv3,4, in addition to fulfilling the requirements for writing 
proper history, Luke had to have conducted direct, meticulous interviews with the eyewitnesses of what 
he wrote about. From the content in the first few chapters of his Gospel, he certainly would’ve had to 
interview Mary mother or Jesus, or perhaps (and this is a stretch) one of Jesus’s siblings, at a minimum, 
the shepherds who were there at his birth, etc. Conducting these interviews and documenting them 
would’ve taken a few months, would’ve had to have taken place in Israel, and would’ve had to have 
taken place in the lifetime of all the witnesses. The timeframe which fits these criteria is Paul’s second 
and third missionary journeys, in particular his third, which was around A.D. 55. This would’ve been the 
latest date for the composition of Luke’s Gospel, as beyond that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’s birth 
would’ve died of old age.
*[B]Lord Theophilus…Lit: Your Excellency Theophilus. Luke addresses Theophilus like he’s an aristocrat or 
that he had authority over him or both. This evidence has led scholars to conjecture that Luke was either 
a freedman, once a slave to Theophilus, or perhaps still a slave. But Theophilus had assigned him to be 
an assistant to Paul, donating Luke to Paul’s ministry like someone would donate a car to a charity. This 
might explain why Luke was the only person still with Paul at the time of his death (2 Tim. 4:11)—he had 
no choice but to stick with him. In any event, slaves in ancient Rome were often educated, and Luke 
certainly was. In addition, the name Theophilus means God-friend. We’ll assume that his name’s not a 
coincidence, that he wasn’t born with the name but changed it or acquired it when he became a 
Christian. In any event, both his name and the interest he has in the events surrounding Jesus’s life 
indicate that he devoted his life to his faith.
It might seem remarkable to us, living in modern times, that a slave or former slave such as Luke could 
write a great work of theology, humanity, and literature, but Epictetus, the Greek stoic philosopher, was 
born a slave. Two great books were written by his student-followers: Discourses and Enchiridion.
*[C]who was of the priestly caste…Lit: of the daughters of Aaron. The priesthood was a hereditary caste 
consisting of males who descended from Aaron, brother of Moses, of the tribe of Levi. The priests were 
not required to marry women from within that caste. Luke goes out of his way to mention the fact that 
Elizabeth was in the Aaronic lineage even before giving her name. This emphasizes the purity of John the 
Baptist’s parents’ pedigree, the level of sanctity, consecration, and cleanness, the Old Testament 
prerequisites for holiness. These John inherited as a result. The extreme degree to which the couple 
were sanctified to God would only magnify the intensity of the view that God was punishing Zechariah 
and Elisabeth by not providing them with a son (v. 7), one who would propagate the priesthood on their 
behalf. As there was no sin that Zechariah and Elisabeth were culpable of, whereby they would’ve 
received God’s disfavor and reproach, it must’ve been a mystery to the people why God would not give 
them a son.
*[D]the holy presence of God (v. 8)…having entered the temple sanctuary itself (v. 9)…This the first 
chamber inside the temple edifice, accessible only to priest. In OT times, God’s presence dwelled in the 
Holy of Holies, the hidden chamber behind the temple sanctuary. To a lesser extent, God’s presence was 
also in the sanctuary. The duties of the priests included entering the temple sanctuary on a regular basis 
to replenish the incense, which must burn at all times, and to switch out the showbread.
*[E]The Lord will use him as a herald in a spirit and power the likeness of which Elijah had…Lit: he himself 
will go before him [be a forerunner] before Him in a spirit and might of Elijah. Coming back to a city after 
victory on the battlefield, conquering commanders sent out forerunners to the towns they’d pass 
through to announce their imminent arrival, to stir up the people to gather in a large, enthusiastic crowd 
when the commander passed through. Also, see note of 1 Cor. 16:6 for go forth and apply that to 
forerunner here.
*[F]shame in the eyes of others…As the ancients didn’t have a scientific understanding of medicine, they 
generally assumed that it a couple couldn’t have a child, somehow it was because of the woman. In 
Elizabeth’s case, they assumed God despised her, perhaps even that she had sinned. Her experience was 
much like Job’s.
[G]In this passage of vv. 47-55, Mary breaks into a poetic discourse, which is comprised of these literary 
elements:
v. 47: The two clauses in this verse constitute a figure of speech, one which consists of the repetition of 
two clauses, both of which in essence express the same thought.
v. 49: Tacking on And holy is His name (Lit: And holy his name) as a clause instead of as a clause offset by 
a relative pronoun, i.e. instead of saying the Capable One whose name is holy.
v. 49: The omission of the word is before holy gives this more of a poetic ring.
v. 50: Like in v. 49, the omission of is or is directed is poetic.
v. 51: He routed…Lit: he scattered. This is a metaphor, a comparison to an army sounding defeating 
another army, in the same way that scatter is used in Psalm 68:1, causing the enemy to break ranks and 
run in a disorderly retreat.
v. 51: The One Exuding power intervened in the affairs of man and did this…Lit: The one exuding might 
did this with his arm. The “arm of the Lord” or a variation of this (like in v. 51) is a Heb. idiom used 
throughout the Old Testament. It refers to God’s ability to intervene in the affairs of mankind, and the 
strength and finality by which he does so.
v. 51: Breaking a single thought into two clauses is a figure of speech. In other words, saying, The one 
exuding might intervened in the affairs of man and did this: He routed those…instead of saying, The one 
exuding might intervened in the affairs of man and routed those…
v. 51: high-and-mighty where the intention of their heart is concerned…Lit: high-and-mighty in intention, 
their hearts. Making their hearts an appositive of high-and-mighty and tweaking the literal meaning is a 
figure of speech.

Luke
80|The child grew and grew and became stronger and stronger in spirit, and 
he stayed out in the wilderness until the time came for his public appearance to the 
nation of Israel.


&LUKE 2
1|Around that time, an edict from Caesar Augustus was issued to the entire 
civilized world. 
2|This edict was a census[a], and this census was the first one issued 
during the tenure of Quirinius, the ruler of the Roman province of Syria. 
3|Everyone 
was either coming or going to be registered, each to the city he belonged to. 
4|So 
Joseph went from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David, which is 
called “Bethlehem,” on account of him being of the lineage of and being a descendant of 
David, 
5|to be registered for the census along with his fiancée Mary, who was 
expecting. 
6|While they were there, her due-date arrived, 
7|and she gave birth to a 
son, her firstborn, wrapped him in a blanket, and laid him in a manger, since there 
wasn’t any room for them in the upstairs floor of the house they were at[A].
          
8|Nearby in the same area, there were shepherds working the night shift 
outdoors, keeping an eye on their sheep. 
9|An angel sent from the Lord appeared to 
them, and the glory of the Lord shined all around them, and they became very 
frightened. 
10|The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, since I’m here, you see, to 
announce to you something good, a message about the tremendous grace which will be 
given to all the people, 
11|since this day a savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born 
in your midst in the city of David. 
12|This is the way you’ll spot him: you’ll find a 
baby all wrapped up lying in a manger.” 
13|And suddenly a multitude of troops[b] 
from the angels in heaven appeared together with the angel praising God, saying over 
and over,


14|Glory to God to the max,
And peace be upon the Earth among men of good intent

          
15|When the angels departed from them back to heaven, the shepherds 
began saying to one another, “Let’s go from one end of Bethlehem to the other, right 
this moment, until we get to look into this situation, this thing that the Lord informed 
us of.” 
16|They left in a hurry and discovered it: Mary, Joseph, and the baby lying 
in the manger. 
17|While looking things over, they made known the details of the 
message spoken to them in regard to this very child. 
18|Many of those who had 
heard what was said were amazed at what the shepherds were telling them; 

19|Mary latched on to all these words while they were being deposited into her 
heart and collected there. 
20|The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God 
for everything they heard about and saw, which was in fact just like it had been spoken to 
them.
          
21|When the eighth day, the day for him to be circumcised, rolled around, 
they named him “Jesus,” the name given by the angel before he was conceived. 

22|And when the purification time, the span of time in accordance with the Old 
Testament[c] statute, had expired, they took him over to Jerusalem to be presented to the 
Lord, 
23|just as it’s written in the Old Testament[c], “Every man-child who is a 
mother’s first delivery shall be designated as set aside for the Lord[d],” 
24|and to 
offer up a sacrifice according to the commandment in the Old Testament[c], “a pair of 
turtledoves or two young doves.”
          
25|Now, you see, there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this 
fellow was righteous and devout, awaiting Israel’s consolation[e], and the Holy Spirit 
was upon him. 
26|He had been informed in a consultation by the Holy Spirit that 
he won’t encounter death before seeing Christ the Lord. 
27|By the Spirit, he went 
to the temple and to the parents as they were presenting the child Jesus, carrying out the 
Old Testament[c] ritual concerning him, 
28|and he himself took him into his arms, 
gave a blessing to God, and said,


29|”At this time You’re releasing Your servant
From his service in peace, Master,
Just like You said you would,

30|Because my eyes have seen Your rescue program[f],

31|That which You’ve prepared in accordance with
The disposition of the people[g]:

32|A light resulting in a revelation for the nations
And resulting in your people Israel’s high regard[h].”

          
33|His father and mother were surprised by what was spoken about him. 

34|Simeon pronounced a blessing on them and said to Mary, “You see, this fellow 
is destined to be the cause of the downfall and rejuvenation[i] of many in Israel and to be 
a portent[j] spoken against them. 
35|And for you—your very life-being[k] will be 
gone through with a sword, pierced from end to end, so that from out of many hearts, 
contemplations and reasonings would be revealed.”
          
36|There was a prophetess named Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of 
Asher. She was up there in years, having married as a young woman, her marriage 
lasting for seven years, 
37|and after that being a widow for 84 years, during which 
time she hadn’t been absent from the temple, fasting and praying day and night in 
service to God. 
38|At the same time the ritual was going on, she went over and stood 
by their side, all the while professing affirmations in acknowledgement to God and 
speaking about Him to all those in Jerusalem awaiting the rectification of their dire 
straits[l].
          
39|When all the rituals prescribed by the Old Testament[c] were concluded, 
they left for Galilee, to their hometown of Nazareth. 
40|Now the child kept on 
growing and kept on getting stronger, while being filled with wisdom, and God’s 
favor[m] was upon him.
          
41|Year after year, his parents kept going back to Jerusalem, to the Passover 
festival, 
42|and when he was twelve years old, they went to Jerusalem according to 
festival custom. 
43|When the festival, which lasted a few days, was over, as they 
were departing, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem, but his parents were unaware. 

44|Having assumed that he was somewhere in the caravan, they were on the road 
a few days and began searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances, 

45|but they weren’t able to find him. They returned to Jerusalem in search of him.
          
46|It so happened that after three days they found him in the temple sitting 
in the middle of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
47|All 
of those who were listening to him were amazed at his understanding—his ability to 
put things together—and at his answers. 
48|Upon seeing this, his parents were taken 
aback, and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us this way? Look—
your father and I have been pulling our hair out looking for you.” 
49|He said to 
them, “Just why now were you searching for me? Didn’t you know that I had to be in 
the midst of my Father’s interests[n]?” 
50|They didn’t put all the pieces together 
from the remark that was spoken to them. 
51|He left with them and went to 
Nazareth, and he was staying in submission to their authority. His mother in her heart 
latched on[o] to all these incidences, one after another; 
*[a]a census…it was also a registration of a sort
*[b]troops…Lit: soldiers
*[c]Old Testament…Lit: Law of Moses (v. 22); law of the Lord (v. 23); the Law (vv. 24, 27, 39)
*[d]who is a mother’s first delivery shall be designated as set aside for the Lord…Lit: who thoroughly opens 
a mother shall be called sanctified to the Lord
*[e]awaiting Israel’s consolation…Or: taking upon himself a call to intercede for Israel (which uses the 
more common definitions of the words therein)…Or: receiving to himself a summons to be an advocate 
[counselor, mediator, comforter, helper] of Israel (which is more literal). Note that v. 38 repeats the 
word awaiting; the two instances of this word are connected.
*[f]rescue program…Lit: salvation
*[g]in accordance with the disposition of the people…lit: according to a face of all the people
*[h]high regard…Lit: glory
*[i]rejuvenation…Lit: resurrection
*[j]portent…Lit: sign
*[k]very life-being…Lit: very soul
*[l]awaiting rectification of their dire straits…Lit: awaiting redemption
*[m]favor…Lit: grace
*[n]in the midst of my Father’s interests…KJV: about my Father’s business
*[o]latched on…Same word used in v. 19 and has the same meaning
*[p]forging ahead…Lit: hack forward. This Gk. word describes someone who’s chopping down brush, trees, 
or other obstacles—even enemy soldiers—in front of oneself, in order to move forward. This is the 
means by which Jesus grew in wisdom, stature, and the favor of God and of man; the implication is that 
life was not handed to him on a silver platter.

[A]the upstairs floor of the house they were at…Or: the inn…Lit: unharnessing. The word refers to the 
unharnessing of horses, hence the derivation of the meaning inn. There is some uncertainty as to what 
the true meaning of this word is as used by Luke; the word means inn but it also means upper room, 
dining hall, spare room, guest room. The word is used elsewhere in the NT (Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11) to 
refer to the upper room, where the Last Supper was held, which is assumed to be the same upper room 
as was occupied on the day of Pentecost. Some claim that this is an upper room of a house. Houses in 
those days were split-level, and often the downstairs was used to house the animals. The upper room 
was the main domicile. This could mean that Mary and Joseph were staying at the lower level of a friend 
or a distant relative’s house, and “there wasn’t any room for them in the inn” simply means that the 
upstairs was already filled. This is more plausible than inn.

&LUKE 3
1|In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was 
governor of Judea, and Herod the ruler[a] in Galilee (his brother Philip, though, was the 
ruler[a] of the regions Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias the ruler[a] of Abiline), 

2|during the tenure of the high priests Annas and Caiaphas, the word of the Lord (i.e. 
a prophetic message) came[A] to John son of Zechariah while in the countryside[b][c]. 
3|He 
went into all the surrounding regions of the Jordan preaching a baptism—a water 
immersion-type of initiation ceremony—signifying a total commitment to a change in 
conduct to live the right way and initiating into a forgiveness of sins.[d], 
4|as it’s been 
written in the Book of Isaiah, the prophet:

The sound of shouting in the countryside:
“Block off the road the Lord will take!
Barricade the streets he’ll be on!” 

5|All valleys will be filled in
And all hills will be leveled;
All the windy roads will get straightened out
And all the rough roads will be resurfaced[B];

6|Every living being will witness God’s rescue program[e].”

          
7|Accordingly, he went on and on saying to the crowd coming out to be 
baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers, who convinced you to run for your lives 
because of the coming wrath? 
8|In line with this, produce the corresponding actions 
on par with a change for the better[f]—and don’t start in with this talk, saying among 
yourselves, ‘We’re in with God because we’re descendants of Abraham.[g]’ Let me tell you 
what—the fact is, God can create from scratch and establish descendants for Abraham 
from out of these stones[C]. 
9|The axe is already lying next to the tree trunk ready to be 
used to cut the tree down; in line with this, all trees not producing good fruit will be 
hacked out and cast into a fire.” 
10|The crowd thereupon asked him,
      “How then are we supposed to conduct our lives?”
          
11|He replied to them by saying, “Whoever has two shirts[h], give one to him 
who doesn’t have any, and the one who has food do the same.”
          
12|Tax collectors[D] also came to be baptized and said, “Teacher, how are we 
supposed to conduct our lives?”
          
13|He said, “Don’t take anything more than what the quotas and tax rates 
mandate.”
          
14|Soldiers also were questioning him, “How are we too supposed to act?”, 
and he said to them,
      “Don’t shake people down for money or take bribes from racketeers, and be 
content with your wages.”
          
15|While the people were in a state of anticipation, everybody was thinking 
the circumstances concerning John over in their heart, going back and forth, trying to 
decide whether he was the Messiah—the Christ—or not. 
16|John declared to them 
all, “Me—I baptize in water. But one’s coming who’s greater than me, one whom I’m 
not worthy enough to carry around by the soles of his shoes.[i] He, for his part, will 
baptize you in a fiery manifestation of the Holy Spirit.[i] 
17|One who, with the 
winnowing fork in his hand, will clear everything off his threshing floor and will gather 
the wheat into his silo, but will burn up the chaff with a fire that will never be put out.”
          
18|So then, at many times and in many different ways exhorting, 
instructing, appealing to, and pleading with the people, again and again he made the 
good news known. 
19|But now, for the ruler Herod, being called out by him in 
regard to his brother’s wife Herodias and in regard to all the wickedness that he, Herod, 
did, 
20|this was the last straw[j], and he locked him up in jail.
          
21|In the course of baptizing all the people, including Jesus, while he was 
being baptized and was praying, the sky opened up, 
22|the Holy Spirit came down 
in bodily form upon him, appearing like a dove[k], and out of the sky a voice said, “You 
are my Beloved Son, with whom I’m pleased.
          
23|Now Jesus himself was around thirty years old, considered to be the son 
of Joseph, who’s the son of Heli, 
24|the son of Matthat, of Levi, of Melki, of Jannai, 
of Joseph,

metaphors, the things described compared to people. The valleys are those who are in despair; the hills 
are those who are haughty; the windy roads are those who are confused or are in error; the rough roads 
are those encumbered by sin.
*[C]establish descendants for Abraham from out of these stones…In the mindset of some of the religious 
Jews of the time, God had chosen the descendants of Abraham to be his people, and His election was 
final. Jesus is saying that that is not the case; if a people whom God has chosen persist in disobeying 
him, God will oust them and replace them. These stones in this verse symbolize the random, unknown, 
and insignificant mass of humanity throughout the world. In this light, Jesus is insinuating that God will 
replace the disobedient Jews with obedient Gentiles, should the Jews persist in their disobedience.

&LUKE 4
1|Now Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, withdrew from the Jordan region and 
proceeded to be led by the Spirit in the wilderness[A], 
2|while for forty days the devil 
kept trying to break him using trials and temptations. He wasn’t eating anything during 
those days, and as that season of time was drawing to its conclusion, he was famished. 

3|So the devil said to him, “If you enjoy the status of Son of God, speak to this rock 
here so that it becomes bread.” 
4|Jesus answered back to him, “It has been written in 
Scripture, ‘Man shall not live upon bread alone.’” 
5|He took him up and showed him 
in a brief moment all the kingdoms of the inhabited world, 
6|and the devil said to 
him, “I will give you the authority over all of these and all the wonderful things in 
them[a], since it was granted to me and to whomever I might desire to give it. 
7|So 
now, if you pay homage to me in obeisance, all of this will be yours.” 
8|Jesus’s reply 
to him was, “It has been written in Scripture,”

“You will pay homage to the Lord God
And to Him alone will you institute worship”


9|He led him to Jerusalem and stood him on top of the battlements of the temple roof 
and said to him, “If you enjoy the status of Son of God, jump down from here; 

10|you see, it’s been written in Scripture,”

“Concerning you, His angels are commanded
To keep a close eye on you and protect you


11|”…and, you see,”

“They’ll snatch you out of the way with their bare hands[b]
To prevent your foot from impacting a stone”


12|And Jesus’s reply to him was, “It has been stated, ‘You will not put the Lord 
your God through His paces[c], to determine whether he passes or fails.’” 
13|And 
the devil, having run through his list of temptations[d], departed from him for the time 
being.
          
14|Jesus returned to Galilee in the miracle-working power of the Spirit. His 
renown spread throughout the surrounding area. 
15|He began to go about 
teaching in their synagogues, while being hailed and applauded[e] by many.
          
16|He went to Nazareth, where he was raised, and introduced himself to 
those in the synagogue and attended their meeting as he was in the habit of doing on 
days which were Sabbaths. He stood up and came forward to do a reading.[B] 
17|A 
scroll was handed to him, the Book of Isaiah (the prophet), and he opened the book and 
found the place where it’s written,


18|The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
And He’s upon me because
He’s bestowed upon me a special dispensation
Of favor and power[C]
To spread the good news to the destitute.
He has sent me to announce, proclaim, and preach
To those in captivity their release
And to the blind the restoration of their sight;
To dispatch the downtrodden and devastated,
Discharging them by means of releasing them from their troubles
And by forgiving their sins;

19|To announce, proclaim, and preach
A season of freedom-celebrations sponsored by the Lord[D].


20|Once he rolled the scroll back up, packed it way, and gave it to the attendant, he 
seated himself before them in order to deliver a message; everyone in the synagogue had 
their eyes fixed on him. 
21|He proceeded to speak, telling them that, this day, their 
own ears have witnessed the fulfillment of this very Scripture. 
22|Everyone was 
caught up in taking note of him and in being amazed at the eloquence of what flowed 
out of his mouth, and were saying, “Isn’t this guy Joseph’s son?”—or something to that 
effect. 
23|He said to them, “I’m sure you’re going to use the line, ‘Put up or shut 
up[E]—the things which we heard that happened in Capernaum, do here too among 
your kinfolk.’” 
24|Then he said, “You can bank on this: no prophet is welcomed 
and taken to heart by his kinfolk. 
25|I’m telling you the spot-on truth—back in the 
days of Elijah there were many widows in Israel, when the sky was closed off preventing 
rain for exactly three and a half years, while a huge famine appeared all over the place. 

26|Elijah wasn’t sent to a single one of them except to a woman in Zarephath in 
Sidon, to a widow there. 
27|And there were many lepers in Israel at the time of the 
prophet Elisha, and none of them had his leprosy purged except for the Syrian 
Naaman.”
          
28|Hearing this, everyone in the synagogue was filled with rage, 

29|and they rose to their feet, kicked him out of the city, and forced him along until 
they got to the crest of the large hill[f] upon which their city had been built, in order to 
toss him down over the edge. 
30|He, though, having wriggled his way out of their 
clutches[F], went his way.
          
31|He went over to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and was teaching them on 
the Sabbaths. 
32|They were time and again amazed at his instruction, since his 
message was captivating and commanding. 
33|Now, there was a man in the 
synagogue who had a vile-and-disgusting, assigned-to-harass[G] spirit, and he yelled out 
in a loud voice, 
34|“Hey! We have no beef with you[g], Jesus of Nazareth! Have you 
come to annihilate us? I know who you are—you’re God’s Holy One!” 
35|Jesus 
shut him down saying, “Shut up and come out of him!” In front of everyone, the demon 
slammed him to the ground and came out of him, never to harm him again. 
36|An 
uproar came upon everyone, and they started saying to each other, “What system of 
belief[h] this is, that he commands the vile-and-disgusting spirits in an authoritative and 
powerful manner, and they depart.” 
37|News concerning him propagated 
throughout the entire surrounding area.
          
38|He got up from the synagogue and went to Simon’s (Peter’s[H]) house. 
Simon’s mother-in-law was running a high fever, and they asked if he could do anything 
for her. 
39|He stood over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she 
got up and started waiting on them. 
40|While the sun was waning, they brought 
him everyone and anyone at all who was unwell[i] with various diseases. He kept 
healing each one of them when he laid his hands on them. 
41|Demons also were 
coming out of many, and on their way out were crying out, “You are the Son of God!” 
He was sternly taking charge over them, forbidding them to speak, since they knew that 
he was the Christ, the Messiah.
          
42|Now when the day had wound down, he left and went to a place which 
was uninhabited. The crowd proceeded to look for him and came over to where he was 
at and kept trying to detain him so that he wouldn’t leave them. 
43|He told them 
that he had to deliver the good news of God’s involvement with mankind (God’s 
kingdom) to the other cities too, since this was the reason he had been sent. 
*[a]all the wonderful things in them…Lit: their glory
*[b]with their bare hands…Lit: upon their hands
*[c]put the Lord your God through His paces…Lit: test out the Lord your God
*[d]run through his list of temptations…Lit: concluded all temptation. A figure of speech.
*[e]hailed and applauded…Lit: glorified
*[f]forced him along until they got to the crest of the large hill…Lit: they led him until the brow of the hill. 
Also, kicked him out of the city (v. 29 also)…same wording as Luke 13:28; ref. note there.
*[g]What beef do you have with me?…Lit: what to us and to you? Ref. note of Matt. 8:29.
*[h]system of belief…Also: message; doctrine; thesis; cohesive body of logic or reasoning…Lit: word
*[i]unwell…Lit: weak, sickly.

*[A]wilderness…Also: countryside. The same word is translated countryside in prior verses. The Judean 
wilderness is harsh, uninhabitable, and rocky.
*[B]He stood up and came forward to do a reading…Lit: he stood to read. Unlike churches today, 
synagogues back then allowed ordinary Israelites to read from the OT and deliver a homily on what they 
read. Also, ref. note of Acts 19:8.
*[C]he’s bestowed upon me a special dispensation of favor and power…Lit: he anointed me. At various 
times in the OT, God conferred special favor and granted special abilities to select individuals for specific 
purposes, usually to the benefit of Israel. This favor and these abilities were conferred in a ceremony 
where a priest or the like would cover (anoint) in oil the one upon whom the favor and abilities were 
conferred, while making a pronouncement to that effect. An example of this can be found in 1 Sam. 
16:12–13.
*[D]A season of freedom-celebrations sponsored by the Lord…Lit: an acceptable year of the Lord. A “year of 
the Lord” refers to the OT Year of Jubilee, which the Law of Moses commands that Israel hold once 
every fifty years. There were laws specific to a Jubilee year, and these laws involved things like the 
freeing of slaves and the cancellation of debts. In the same way, this season of celebration is a Jubilee-
like occasion, as described in the previous verses, where the captives are set free, the blind regain their 
sight, the downtrodden are released.
*[E]put up or shut up…Lit: doctor, treat yourself…Some liberties taken. An idiom assumed to be a common 
expression of the time.
*[F]He,though, having wriggled his way out of their clutches…Lit: But he himself, having gone through their 
midst. Some indications in the GT here hint that Jesus didn’t conjure up a miracle that would placate the 
angry mob, thus allowing him to walk away, but that’s not what happened. He had to exercise a 
measure of force and recalcitrance on his part to escape their clutches. The evidence in the GT is that, 
first, Luke uses an explicit personal pronoun for he, which has connotations apart from the face-value 
meaning of the word he. Luke is telling us something by choosing this pronoun; he’s telling us that Jesus 
himself was taking some action when leaving the mob. Second, Luke chooses the verb to go through 
rather than to go out of, the latter form being expected had no force been involved. Going through 
emphasizes the opposition he faced, while going out of would have deemphasized that opposition.
Not only this, but the phrase used in v. 30 dia mesou [through midst, διὰ μέσου, (διὰ /Strong’s 1223),( 
μέσου/Strong’s 3319)] is almost identical in wording to the Gk. idiom ek mesou [out of midst, ἐκ μέσου) 
(ἐκ /Strong’s 1537), (μέσου/Strong’s 3319)], and should be considered to be another idiom of similar or 
same meaning. Ek mesou (ref. 2 Thess. 2:7, Matt. 13:49; Acts 17:33; Acts 23:10; 1 Cor. 5:2; 2 Cor. 6:17; 
Col 2:14) “is a Greek idiom for being out of the way, and always implies decisive action, either of the 
person’s own will or of force on the part of others,” Figures of Speech Used in the Bible, E.W. Bullinger, 
p. 838.
*[G]vile-and-disgusting, assigned-to-harass spirit…Lit: spirit demonic unclean. In the GT, the noun spirit is 
listed first followed by the adjectives demonic unclean. The adjective demonic comes from the root verb 
daimonao (δαιμονάω/no Strong’s number), which has the primary meaning to be subject to an avenging 
deity. Daimonao is rooted in Greek mythology, where a person lost favor with one of the gods, and that 
god sent a lesser god or some other supernatural creature to torment said person. Also related to 
daimonao is the Gk. verb daimonizomai (δαιμονίζομαι/Strong’s 1139), which has a primary definition to 
have an allotted fate. In the case of daimonizomai, it’s as though a god of mythology choose to use his 
or her supernatural power against a mortal being, and the person, being mortal, is trapped in the bonds 
of a superior, supernatural being, and therefore locked into the fate dictated by the god. Related to the 
use of these two words, Paul’s thorn in the flesh (2 Cor. 12:6–7) is actually that: a daimonion 
(δαιμόνιον/Strong’s 1140): a spirit assigned to him. Therefore, in a biblical context, the word demonic 
means a being sent to torment or harass someone. The other adjective, the word unclean, is used 
throughout the OT for things forbidden by the Law of Moses to be touched, handled, things which are 
impure, unholy, and must be altogether shunned. These three words, spirit demonic unclean, construct 
a different meaning to what was tormenting this man in the synagogue. First, spirit means that it wasn’t 
a natural creature but a supernatural one. Second, demonic means that the evil spirit is given a specific 
assignment to torment a person. Third, unclean means that the spirit is all-around disgusting in its evil, 
irredeemably so.
[H]Simon’s (Peter’s)…The GT does not say Peter’s. In the NT, Peter has multiple names, the name Peter 
added to clarify what might otherwise be confusing.

&LUKE 5
1|Now on one particular day there happened to be a crowd situated in close 
proximity to him, listening to the word of God; he, though, had taken a place standing 
on the shoreline of the lake, Lake Gennesaret. 
2|He saw two boats docked on the 
lake’s shore. Now the fishermen who manned these boats had disembarked and were 
scrubbing their fishing nets. 
3|But one of them—and this was Simon—was still 
onboard one of the boats. He asked him to cast the boat out a bit from the shore, and he, 
having taken a seat in the boat, began to teach the crowd from the boat. 
4|Now as he 
wrapped up his talk, he said to Simon,
       “Take the boat out into deep waters and cast the nets out for a haul.”
          
5|Simon answered back, “We’ve been at it all night working and haven’t 
gotten a thing; but since you said so, I’ll cast the nets.”
          
6|And when they’d done this, they entrapped a huge swarm of fish, to the 
point where it was beginning to break their nets. 
7|They motioned to their partners in 
the other boat to come help haul the fish in, and they came and filled both boats to their 
sinking thresholds. 
8|Simon Peter, having witnessed this, fell to his knees before Jesus 
saying, “Leave me, sir, since I’m a sinful man.” 
9|You see, those surrounding him and 
all those who were a part of his company were amazed at the take of fish being hauled 
in. 
10|In the same way, so were the sons of Zebedee, James and John, Simon’s 
coworkers. Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid: from now on, you’ll be catching men, 
taking them alive[A].” 
11|And after the boats returned to shore, they all left and 
became his followers.
          
12|While he happened to still be in one of the boats, a man with a full-blown 
case of leprosy appeared out of nowhere. Seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged 
him, “Sir, should you desire to do so, you can purge the leprosy from me.” 
13|He 
stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I do so desire: be purged.” 
Immediately, the leprosy departed from him. 
14|He, though, told him sternly and 
in no uncertain terms to not tell anyone, but instead to go and show himself to the priest 
and to bring him that which the Old Testament[a] commanded, in order that the 
evidence be submitted for an official confirmation of the purging of the disease[b].
          
15|But to an even greater extent, information concerning him spread 
through and throughout, and huge crowds kept gathering together to listen and to be 
treated and healed of everything that was dragging them down, physically[c]. 
16|As 
far as his own self was concerned, he kept stealing away to various places out in the 
countryside, alone, praying continually.
          
17|He happened to be teaching one day, and in attendance, paying 
attention, were Pharisees and instructors[d] in the Law of Moses, who had come from all 
of the towns of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. There was a supernatural power of the 
Lord present for him to perform healing. 
18|Just like that, a group of men showed up 
carrying a person who was paralyzed on a cot, and they were trying to bring him in and 
place him in front him, for him to attend to him. 
19|Since they weren’t able to find 
any way to bring him in on account of the crowd, they climbed up and got on the 
rooftop patio, and they lowered him down through the roof itself and put him together 
with his cot right smack in front of Jesus. 
20|Seeing their faith, he said, “Fellow, 
your sins are forgiven.” 
21|The designated teachers and the Pharisees proceeded to 
mull this over,
      “Just who is this guy, who speaks blasphemies? Who, except for God alone, has 
the ability to forgive sins?”
          
22|Now Jesus, aware of what they’d been mulling over, responded to them 
by saying, “What are you mulling over in your hearts? 
23|What’s easier, to say, 
‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk around’? 
24|But in order that 
you might know that the Man[e] has authority on Planet Earth to forgive sins…“ He 
addressed the paralytic, “…I’m speaking to you: get up, take your cot and go home.” 

25|Immediately and in front of everyone, he got up from that which he’d been 
seemingly forever lying upon and left for home, glorifying God. 
26|Everyone became 
ecstatic[f] and began to glorify God, and they were filled with deep reverence, saying, 
“We witnessed an incredible miracle.”
          
27|After this he departed. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the 
tax booth, and he said to him, “Be one of my followers.” 
28|He left everything 
behind, got up, and became one of his followers. 
29|Levi threw a huge party[g] for 
him at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors was there and others were there with 
them seated around the table[h]. 
30|The Pharisees and their designated teachers[i][B] 
started to grumble to his disciples, “Why do you live it up[j] with the tax collectors and 
sinners?” 
31|Jesus replied to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a doctor, 
but instead those who have something wrong with them do. 
32|I haven’t come to 
summon those who do right to turn their life around, but rather to summon sinners to 
turn their life around.[k]”
          
33|His disciples said to him, “John fasts day and night, and so do the 
Pharisees, but your clique[l] parties[j].” 
34|Jesus said, “The groom’s cronies[m] can’t 
engage in a fast while the groom is with them. 
35|There too will come a day when 
the groom will be taken away from them, and when those days come, they’ll fast.” 

36|He then proceeded to tell them an analogy. “No one cuts a patch out of a new 
coat and puts it on a new jacket. Sure enough, both the patch will tear and it won’t mesh 
with the old material. 
37|And nobody puts freshly-squeezed grape juice into old 
wineskins. Sure enough, the unfermented wine will cause the wineskins to burst and 
spill all over the place, and the wineskins will be ruined. 
38|No—instead, you’ve 
got to put grape juice into new wineskins. 
*[a]the Old Testament…Lit: Moses
*[b]the evidence be submitted for an official confirmation of the purging of the disease…Ref. note of Matt. 
8:4
*[c]everything that was dragging them down, physically…Lit: weaknesses
*[d]instructors…The instructors in the Law of Moses (v.17)are the same as the designated teachers (v. 21): 
the Scribes
*[e]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[f]everyone became ecstatic…Lit: an ecstasy took [ahold of] everyone
*[g]threw a huge party…Also: held a large reception
*[h]seated around the table…Lit: lying down. Ref. note of Matt. 14:19.
*[i]designed teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[j]live it up…Lit: eat and drink. An idiom.
*[k]I haven’t come to summon those who do right to turn their life around, but rather to summon sinners 
to turn their life around…Lit: I haven’t come to call righteous but rather sinners to repentance. Mixing up 
the word order, namely stating, call righteous but rather sinners to repentance, instead of, call righteous 
to repentance but rather sinners to repentance, is a figure of speech.
*[l]your clique…Lit: those with you
*[m]groom’s cronies…Lit: sons of the groom

*[A]catching men, taking them alive…Lit: the single Gk. word zōgreō (ζωγρέω/Strong’s 2221). This refers to 
capturing prisoners of war in combat. In this passage, the fish were hauled in alive and not dead, and 
Jesus is making an analogy to this. In the same way, people who receive word of God are “captured 
alive” in a sense; once captured they continue to live. They are like prisoners of war in that their life 
changes: they are interned, they work in captivity, but are also cared for in captivity. Those who do the 
capturing must make provide for those captured; this is what Jesus is also hinting at—not only will Peter 
capture men, but he’ll have to have some sort of plan for them after they’re captured: a plan of 
discipleship.
*[B]their designated teachers…Lit: (the same). It’s unclear what exactly their means in this verse, but it 
seems to indicate that the Pharisees were subordinate to the Scribes, or at least held them in high 
esteem.
[C]Plus, nobody while drinking the old wants the new; you see, he says, ‘The old stuff’s better.’”…A few of 
the principal manuscripts have omitted v. 39, and one might speculate that this was done because the 
verse is awkward and enigmatic. Verse 39 describes a person who, while in the act of drinking the older 
wine, claims that he prefers the older to the newer, without giving due consideration to the new. While 
drinking the old, his heightened awareness of its subtle, unique flavor causes him to lose any objectivity 
to the different qualities that the new will possess. His fondness for the wine at the moment produces a 
reaction which rejects any substitute—even to his detriment, as he may thoroughly enjoy the new wine 
also, were he to just give it a chance.
And it reminds me of an old company in the landscape of corporate America which has an excellent 
product—be it an aircraft, a soft drink, what have you—and management in their hubris (or under 
pressure from the stockholders) thinks they can tinker with it and either to improve it or to shave a few 
pennies off its cost. But the old product is better. Or, don’t you miss the way they built such-and-such a 
few decades ago?—You have to pay top dollar on the used market to get one, because they’re not made 
anymore.
These analogies are relevant to this passage. There were movements of God going on at the time, one of 
austerity (John the Baptist) and one of celebration (Jesus). Both are very different from one another. 
When one is caught up in the one, he becomes so enthralled with it that he will not see the value in the 
other. Jesus says that both are necessary and that there’s a time and place for both. Another application 
is that the old-timers had a more powerful presence of the Holy Spirit in their services than we do today.

4|when he entered the house of God, took the holy bread[a]—which nobody’s allowed 
to eat except for the priests—ate it, and gave it to those with him as well?” 
5|He 
proceeded to tell them, “The Man[b] is master of the Sabbath.”
          
6|On another Sabbath, he introduced himself to those in the synagogue and 
was teaching there. There was a man there whose right hand was all shriveled up.[c] 

7|The designated teachers[d] and the Pharisees were keeping a close eye on him, to see 
if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they’d be able to find some violation of the Law of 
Moses to accuse him of before a judge. 
8|He, though, knew what they were mulling 
over on the inside and what their intentions were, so he said to the man with the 
shriveled-up hand, “Get up and stand front and center[e].” He got up and stood where he 
was told to. 
9|Jesus said to them, “Question for you all: on the Sabbath, is it legal 
according to the Law of Moses to do something good or something bad, to save someone’s 
life or to annihilate him?” 
10|He looked around at everyone and said to him, 
“Stretch your hand out.” He did, and his hand was restored to its original form. 

11|They, though, had lost their wits filled with rage and began to talk things over 
with one another, about what they would do to Jesus if they had the chance.
          
12|One day back then, he withdrew to a mountain to pray and was praying 
continuously to God all night long. 
13|When daylight came, he called his disciples 
to gather around, and chose twelve from among them, which twelve are also called 
“missionaries[f]”: 
14|Simon, who was renamed Peter, his brother Andrew, James, 
John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
15|Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alpheus, Simon the 
insurrectionist, 
16|Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, the one who became a 
traitor.[A]
          
17|He descended with them and stopped when the ground leveled off, and 
there was gathered a large crowd of his disciples, and a great many of the people were 
from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and Tyre and Sidon, which are on the coast. 

18|They came to listen to what he had to say and to be healed from their diseases. 
Those tormented by vile, disgusting[g] spirits were being treated, one after another, 

19|and all the while the entire crowd sought to be touched by him, since the 
supernatural power that accompanied him kept on issuing out of him and healing 
everyone.
          
20|He, for his part, directed his attention to[h] his disciples and proceeded to 
say,

“Blessed be the poor,
Since God will interact with you (the kingdom of God is yours).

21|Blessed be they who are hungering at this moment,
      Since they’ll be satiated.
Blessed be they who are weeping at this moment,
Since they’ll laugh.

          
22|”Blessed are you when people hate you, ostracize you, chastise you in a 
shameful, disgracing manner[i], and kick your reputation—and, for that matter, 
everything you stand for—to the curb as though you’re a bad person[j], on account of 
the Man. 
23|When that day rolls around, rejoice, be glad, and jump for joy, since—
get this—your heavenly paycheck will be huge. The fact is, their ancestors were in the 
habit of doing the same things to the Old Testament prophets.


24|”But now, you—you who are rich—you’re in for it[k],
Because you’ve received all
The advocacy, consolation, and comfort
You’re ever going to get.

25|You’re in for it, you who at this moment have reached
The point where your belly is stuffed,
Because you will go hungry.
You’re in for it, you who laugh at this moment,
Because you will mourn and weep.

26|You’re in for it when all the people speak well of you.
The fact is, their ancestors treated
The evil impersonators of prophets[l] the same way.

          
27|”Anyways, I’m telling those of you who’re listening: love your enemies 
with a love that esteems their inner being; treat those who hate you well; 
28|speak 
well of those who swear at you; 
29|to those who slap your face—present the other 
cheek too[B] (i.e., don’t change the way you treat the person who mistreated you and seek 
retaliation); don’t withhold your shirt from those who take your jacket from you. 

30|Give to everyone who asks you to, and don’t demand your stuff back. 

31|The way you want people to treat you is the same way you should treat them. 

32|And if you love those who love you, what sort of gracious demeanor is with 
you? The fact is, even the wrong-doers love those who love them. 
33|And if you do 
good to those who do good to you, what sort of gracious demeanor is with you? Even 
the wrong-doers do the same. 
34|And if you lend to those who you’re confident 
will pay you back, what sort of graciousness is that? Even the wrong-doers lend to 
fellow wrong-doers expecting to get the same amount back. 
35|So now, love your 
enemies, do good things, and lend without any hope of getting anything back, and your 
paycheck will be huge, and you will follow in the footsteps of the Highest[m], since He 
for His part is good and kind when it comes to the ungracious—the mean and the 
exacting—and the evil—the lying, cheating, stealing, selfish, etc. 
36|Become 
merciful and compassionate just like your Father is merciful and compassionate.
          
37|”Don’t draw conclusions about people[C], and you won’t have 
conclusions drawn about you. Don’t write people off[C], and you won’t be written off. 
Let things slide, and the same will be done for you. 
38|Give, and this is what you’ll 
get back: they’ll put a compacted, shaken until the gaps are eliminated, running over the 
top, good amount into your pocket[n]. You see, the portion that you allot is what will be 
allotted back to you.”
          
39|He gave them this analogy: “A blind man can’t lead another blind man 
down the road, can he? Both will fall into a deep pothole. 
40|A disciple is not 
superior to the instructor, is he? Once they’ve completed their training, everyone will be 
like his instructor.“
          
41|”Now why do you see the splinter that’s in your buddy’s[o] eye, but you 
don’t notice the plank that’s in your own eye? 
42|How can you say to your buddy, 
‘Hey, guy, let me pry that splinter out of your eye,’ but you’re not seeing the same 
thing—in your case a beam—in your own eye? Hypocrite—first pry the beam out of 
your eye, and then you’ll be able to see clearly in order to pry the splinter out of your 
buddy’s eye.
          
43|”You see, there isn’t such a thing as a good tree producing rotten fruit; 
and not just that, but a rotten tree producing good fruit. 
44|The fact is, you’ll come 
to know each tree from what it yields. You see, they don’t gather figs from thorn shrubs, 
nor do they gather clusters of grapes from thorns which grow on vines. 
45|From 
out of the storage[p] of goodness of the heart, the good man brings forth good, and from 
out of the evil store, the evil man brings forth evil. You see, from out of the heart’s 
abundance, one’s[q] mouth speaks.
          
46|”Now, why do you call me ‘Boss, Boss![r]’ and don’t do what I say? 

47|Everyone who comes to me, hears my words, and does them, I’ll show you 
what he’s comparable to: 
48|He’s comparable to a man building a house who dug 
down deep, bottomed out, and placed the foundation upon the bedrock. A flash-flood 
storm appeared, the winds thrashed that house, and the storm wasn’t powerful enough 
to rattle it on account of it being well-built.

was shriveled up. The literal wording of the GT is a figure of speech. The figure of speech is breaking the 
two connected thoughts into two loosely connected clauses separated by the conjunction and.
*[d]designed teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[e]stand front and center…Lit: stand in our midst
*[f]”missionaries”…Lit: apostles. Translated means sent ones. J.B. Phillip’s translation translates apostle as 
special messenger.
*[g]vile, disgusting…Lit: unclean
*[h]directed his attention to…Lit: lifted up his eyes to. Lift up the eyes or is an expression used throughout 
the Bible. It means to stop focusing narrowly on one thing or one task and look at things more broadly, 
whether to look at matters in a broader perspective, or (in this case) consider all the people and not just 
a few.

*[n]put…into your pocket…Lit: give…to your bosom. Bosom in this context refers to the fold of clothing 
near your body where cash and other items are carried. “Giving to your bosom” is a figure of speech 
called a metonymy; the items will actually be given to you, not given to your bosom.

because Jesus is talking about a servant or slave replying to his employer or master.

*[A]the one who became a traitor…The twelve apostles are listed here in order of their importance, from 
greatest to least, with a couple of exceptions. Andrew is listed after Peter because he’s his brother; 
James is listed before John because he’s his older brother, but John was actually the more important of 
the two. Judas Iscariot takes last place in the list. Bartholomew is the same as Nathanael . Simon the 
insurrectionist in the GT reads Simon the Zealot, as the Zealots were insurrectionists.
*[B]to those who slap your face—present the other cheek too…Ref. note of Matt. 5:39
[C]draw conclusions…write people off…Lit: judge…condemn. To begin to understand what Jesus means by 
judging and condemning, one should first learn from other Scriptures what it is not. It is not taking no 
account of what others do (one example: “Know them which labor among you,” 1 Thess. 5:12). In the 
NT, if someone who claimed to be a Christian conducted himself in an immoral manner, this person was 
to be treated like an infidel. But ascertaining such behavior is not judging. Judging is drawing 
conclusions, based on a person’s history, concluding what their fate or destiny must be. Condemning a 
person is determining that a person who has guilt due to sin will never be able to escape it, that part or 
all of their life is irredeemable—Even though it may in fact be irredeemable. To judge someone is to 
weigh them by their motives and not by their actions. To condemn someone is to assign them 
consequences. Concerning judging, ref. note of Matt. 7:1 also.

49|But he who hears and doesn’t do,

foundation, and the stream thrashed the house and immediately it collapsed. When it 
was all over, the extent of that house’s collapse was enormous.”


&LUKE 7
1|Since he finished going through all of his material with those listening—a 
bunch of ordinary folk[a]—he entered Capernaum. 
2|Now there was this centurion’s 
servant, whom the centurion[A] held in high esteem, who was sick and about to pass 
away. 
3|Having heard about Jesus, he sent distinguished, respected Jewish citizens to 
him, asking him if he would come and resuscitate his servant. 
4|Approaching Jesus, 
they asked him—begged him—to hurry up, saying that this particular individual is 
worth him going out of his way to help, 
5|since he loves and values our people, and 
that he single-handedly built us a synagogue. 
6|So Jesus proceeded to go with them.
      They had already made it to where they were not too far from his house, when 
the centurion sent some of his close friends telling him, “Sir, don’t put yourself out; you 
see, it’s not appropriate for you to set foot in my house for a visit[b], 
7|seeing that I’m 
not considered worthy of you associating with me[c]. Instead, just say the word and have 
my servant receive healing[B]. 
8|You see, I too am a man who’s under chain-of-
command-structured authority[d], having soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Have him 
go forth,’ and he goes, and tell someone else, ‘Come here’ and he comes, and tell my 
servant, ‘Do this thing,’ and he does it.” 
9|Jesus heard these things and was amazed at 
him and turned to the crowd following him and said, “I’m telling you what, I haven’t 
run across such faith anywhere else in Israel.” 
10|When they got back home, those 
who were dispatched found the servant in good health.
          
11|The next thing that happened was that he went to a city called Nain, 
accompanied by his disciples and by a large crowd. 
12|As he neared the city gate, 
he ran across a dead man being carried out, his mother’s only son (and she herself was a 
widow[C]); a sizable crowd from the city was accompanying her. 
13|Upon seeing 
her, the Lord felt compassion deep in his heart for her and said, “Don’t cry.” 
14|He 
went over and touched the open coffin[e]; the pallbearers came to a halt and stood still. 
He said, “Young man, I’m speaking to you—get up!” 
15|The dead person sat up 
and began talking, and they handed him over to his mother. 
16|A deep reverence 
came upon everyone[f], and they glorified God saying that a great prophet had been 
brought to prominence[g] among them, and that God has paid a visit to His people. 

17|The news of this affair propagated throughout the entire region of Judea and all 
the surrounding area.
          
18|His disciples told John about all of these things, and John summoned two 
of his disciples 
19|and sent them to the Lord saying, “Are you the One-Who-Is-To-
Come[h], or should we wait for someone else?” 
20|These men met with him and 
said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to say, ‘Are you the One-Who-Is-To-Come, or 
should we wait for someone else?’” 
21|During the last couple of hours just then, he 
had treated many people of diseases, of whatever bad thing happened to be beating the 
tar out of them[i], and of evil spirits, and he graciously granted many who were blind 
the gift of sight. 
22|He replied to them, “Go tell John what you saw and heard: the 
blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are purged of their leprosy, the deaf hear, 
the dead are resurrected, the destitute are told good news— 
23|and blessed is he 
who isn’t offended with me[j].”
          
24|So John’s messengers left, and he proceeded to speak to the crowd about 
John, “What did you go out to the countryside[D] to take a look at? A twig fluttering in 
the breeze? 
25|Instead, what did you witness? A man dressed up in delicate 
apparel[k]? You see, those wearing splendid attire and living the life of luxury live in 
palaces. 
26|Rather, what did you go out to see? A prophet?—Yes, I’m telling you, 
and more than just your run-of-the-mill prophet. 
27|This fellow’s been written about 
in Scripture,

“See here, I will send my messenger
To where your attention is fixated,
Who’ll prepare your road ahead of you


28|”I’m telling you, nobody’s ever been born on this planet who’s greater than 
John[l], but the least significant that God’s involved with (in God’s kingdom) is greater 
than he.” 
29|Everyone in the crowd who was listening—ordinary folk including tax 
collectors—had affirmed God, making Him the right choice, having been baptized in 
John’s baptism. 
30|But the Pharisees and the Old Testament[m] experts disavowed 
God’s will, plan, and purpose for their own selves, not being baptized by him.
          
31|“For that matter, in what analogy can I draw a comparison of the men to, 
the men adhering to the present-day Zeitgeist[n]? 
32|They’re comparable to 
children sitting around in the marketplace and calling over to some other children,

      “We played the flute for you, and you wouldn’t dance;
      We sang a dirge, and you wouldn’t weep and wail[E]


33|”The fact is, John the Baptist came on the scene not eating bread or drinking 
wine—living a life of austerity—and you say, ‘He’s compelled to do this by a demon.’” 

34|The Man[o] came on the scene eating and drinking—living the good life—and you 
say, ‘Get ahold of this guy—he parties[p] and hangs around tax collectors and other kinds 
of sinners.’ 
35|Wisdom is declared to be correct by the end-result[q].”
          
36|One of the Pharisees asked if he would dine with him, and he entered the 
Pharisee’s house and was seated[r]. 
37|By chance, there was a woman there in that 
city—a sinner[F]—and she found out that he was dining at the Pharisee’s house, and she 
took a jar of myrrh 
38|and stood next to him, across from his feet, sobbing with 
tears all over. She proceeded to rain tears down on his feet, wipe them down with her 
hair and fervently kiss them, and to pour myrrh all over them. 
39|Seeing this, the 
Pharisee who invited him over said to himself,
      “If this guy were a prophet, he’d be mindful of[F] who the woman is who’s 
touching him and of what sort of woman she is, since she’s a sinner.”
          
40|Jesus’s response to this was, “Simon, I’d like to tell you something.”
      “Speak up, teacher”.
          
41|”There were two debtors. The first one owed $50,000[s], and the second 
one owed $5,000, both to the same lender. 
42|Not having the funds with which to 
repay him, both asked to be let off the hook. So now, which of them do you think will 
be more endeared to him?”
          
43|Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the greater amount 
cancelled will be.”
      He said, “You’ve guessed right.”
          
44|He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “See this woman here? I 
entered your house, and you didn’t pour water on my feet in order to wash them; but she, 
now, showered my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 
45|You didn’t 
greet me at the door with a kiss[G]; but she, now, hasn’t stopped kissing my feet since the 
moment she entered the house. 
46|You didn’t caress my head with lotion[H]; but she, 
now, covered my feet with special oil—
47|I’m being blunt with you—her sins—
and there’s a lot of them—have been forgiven because of the volume of love, value, and 
appreciation that came out of her[t]. He who’s been forgiven of little loves, values, and 
appreciates little.” 
48|He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 
49|The dinner 
guests started to talk among themselves, “Who is this guy?—He even forgives sins.” 

*[a]Since he finished going through all of his material with those listening—a bunch of ordinary folk…Lit: 
Since he filled all the messages of his unto the listeners of the people. An example of the colorful prose of 
Luke.

*[t]because of the volume of love, value, and appreciation that came out of her…Lit: because she loved 
[agapaō (ἀγαπάω/Strong’s 25)] much
*[u]has rescued you…Lit: has saved you

*[A]centurion…The Roman equivalent to an army captain. The issue here was that the centurion was a 
Gentile and that the Jews were not supposed to have any contact with the Gentiles—certainly not any 
close contact. This is why the centurion said in v. 6 that it’s not appropriate for Jesus to come pay him a 
visit of a personal nature.
*[B]and have my servant receive healing…Lit: have my servant be healed. The principle manuscripts 
diverge on this. The other principles instead say, and my servant will be healed. The former, and grant 
that my servant be healed, is the reading chosen by the UBS NT, the correct choice. The UBS choice is 
consistent with and confirmed by the centurion’s statement in verse 8 which says, I say to this one, have 
him come, and he comes. The verb tense used in both grant that my servant be healed (for grant…be 
healed) and I say to this one, have him go forth, and he goes (for have him go) are both 3rd person 
imperatives. The meaning in the 3rd person imperative of have him come is more clear: the centurion is 
giving an order to a third party, the order being for the third party to relay another order to the person, 
the one who’s being summoned. What the centurion wants is for Jesus to relay a command through a 
third party (his friends), instead of Jesus giving a person-to-person order without the third party relay. 
This is the way that chain-of-command-structured authority hierarchies work; you can give a command 
to a subordinate who will in turn pass the command down the chain of subordinates. The centurion’s 
faith caused him to recognize that the kingdom of God must also be a chain-of-command-structured 
authority hierarchy, or else if wouldn’t function.
*[C]his mother’s only son (and she herself was a widow)…With the death of her husband and only son, she 
had nobody to support her; this magnified the pity which Jesus had for her. 
*[D]the countryside…Lit: the wilderness. John spent all of this time out in the wilderness, avoiding cities, 
due to his austere lifestyle; Jesus visited both wilderness and city.
*[E]We sang a dirge, and you wouldn’t weep and wail …Ref. note of Matt. 11:17
*[F]a sinner…be mindful of…Also: (for be mindful of) continuously aware of; ever cognizant of. The way 
that she’s singled out as being “a sinner” (v.37) and the verb tense in be mindful of (v. 39) insinuate that 
she’s an adulterous or is sexually immoral in some other way. This verse literally reads, he would’ve 
known she was a sinner, leaving the implication that he would’ve done something about it.
*[G]you didn’t greet me at the door with a kiss…Lit: you didn’t give me a kiss. As seen in various places in 
the NT, it was customary back then to greet someone of the same sex with a kiss. The kiss was a cordial 
greeting, a sign of friendship and comradery. In fact, the Gk. word philos (φίλος /Strong’s 5384), usually 
translated love, sometimes means kiss or friend.
[H]caress my head with lotion…cover my feet with special oil…Lit: anoint my head with oil…anoint my feet 
with myrrh. Myrrh is much more expensive than oil. Ref. note of Matt. 6:17 for anointing with oil.

Luke

1|The next thing that happened was that he was travelling non-stop from city 
to city and town to town preaching the good news of God’s involvement with mankind 
(God’s kingdom), accompanied by the Twelve 
2|and by certain women who had been 
treated from being afflicted by filthy, disgusting spirits and from ailments, Mary (called 
Magdalene), from whom seven demons had come out, 
3|and Joanna the wife of 
Herod’s butler Chuza, Susanna, and many others, the very women who were there for 
them time and time again attending to their needs, doing so from out of their personal 
wealth and belongings.
          
4|As a large crowd was gathering—including those travelling from each city to 
see him—he spoke by means of analogy, 
5|”The sower went out to sow his seed. In 
the course of sowing, some happened to fall next to the path and was stepped on, and 
the birds ate it all up. 
6|Other seed landed on the rocky ground, shot up, and dried out 
because it didn’t have the moisture it needed. 
7|Other seed fell in the thorn patches, and 
the thorn bushes grew alongside it and choked it out. 
8|Other seed fell on what’s 
designated as ‘the good ground,’ grew up, and produced a 100-to-1 yield.” In the course 
of delivering this message, he kept on saying, “A word to the wise is sufficient.[a]”
          
9|Now his disciples asked him what the analogy was supposed to mean. 

10|He said, “It’s been granted to you to acquire an understanding of the 
mysterious and profound things of God’s involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom), 
but everyone else is left with just a bunch of stories[b], in order that,

“When they’re looking, they won’t see
When they’re listening, they won’t understand

          
11|”So this is what the analogy means: the seed is the word of God. 

12|The seeds next to the path are those who heard, and then the devil comes and 
removes the word from their hearts, in order that they won’t believe and escape their 
predicament. 
13|The seeds on the rocky ground—when these people hear, they 
receive the word with joy, but these people have no root-system: they believe for an 
interval of time, and during a period when it’s put to the test, they fall away[c] from it. 

14|Now that which has fallen in the thorn patches—these are the ones who have 
heard and by the coming of anxieties, abundance and wealth, and the pleasures of life, 
they’re choked, and their fruit isn’t brought forth to maturity. 
15|Now that which 
has fallen in the good soil—these ones are whoever heard with a heart which is all-
around good[A], holds onto it, and by perseverance bears mature fruit.
          
16|”No one who’s lit a lamp obscures it by putting it in a box or under a 
dining couch, but instead puts it on a lampstand, so that it provides light for those 
entering. 
17|The fact is, there’s nothing that’s hidden that won’t become visibly 
manifest, nor that’s secret that there’s no way it won’t come to be known and come to 
be visibly manifest. 
18|So now, pay attention to how you listen. You see, he who 
seeks to have[d], it will be given to him, and he who won’t seek to have[d], even what he 
thinks he has will be taken away from him.”
          
19|Now his mother and brothers stopped by but weren’t able to pay him a 
visit on account of the crowd. 
20|They sent him a message, “Your mother and your 
brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.” 
21|But he replied to them, “My 
mother and my brother are those who hear the word of God and do it.”
          
22|Something happened one day. He and his disciples boarded a boat and 
he told them, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the lake,” and they set sail. 

23|While sailing, he fell asleep. A wind storm touched down on the lake, and the 
boat began to take on water and was in danger. 
24|They went over to him and 
woke him up, “Boss, boss, we’re going under[e]!” He got up, spoke sternly to the wind 
and the high waves, and they stopped and it became calm. 
25|He said to them, 
“Where’s your faith?” They became awestruck, saying to each other, “Just who is this 
guy, that he commands the winds and the water, and they obey him?”
          
26|They landed in the district of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from 
Galilee. 
27|After disembarking onto dry land, a man accosted him, someone from 
the city who had a demon which was harassing him. For a good amount of time, he 
hadn’t been wearing clothes, and he wasn’t living in a house but instead was living in 
the tombs. 
28|Seeing Jesus, he screamed, prostrated himself in front of him, and 
said in a loud voice, “I have no beef with you[f], Jesus son of the Most High God. I’m 
begging you—don’t torment me.”
          
29|You see, he had commanded the dirty, disgusting spirit to come out of 
the man. As things were, for a long time it had held a tight grip on him, and he was 
kept tied up in chains, hands and feet both, continuously being restrained. Constantly 
breaking the chains, he kept on being driven by the demon out to the middle of 
nowhere. 
30|Jesus asked him, “What’s your name?” He said, “’Regiment[g]’,” since 
many demons had entered him. 
31|They begged that he wouldn’t order them to be 
sent away into the Bottomless Pit[B].
          
32|Now there was a sizable herd of pigs there feeding on the hill, and they 
begged him to permit them to enter into those animals. He permitted them. 
33|The 
demons left the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the 
lake and drowned.
          
34|Seeing what had happened, the pig herders began to flee, and they 
spread the report in the city and in the grain fields. 
35|People came out to look at 
and see for themselves what had taken place and went to Jesus and found the man from 
whom the demons left sitting, clothed, in a sound state of mind, and submitting himself 
to Jesus, sitting at his feet, and they became terrified. 
36|Those watching how the 
demon-possessed man was set straight and restored[h] to sanity filled them in on what 
happened. 
37|The entire multitude from the area surrounding the Gerasenes asked 
him to go away, because a tremendous fear had come over them. In response, he got in 
the boat and returned across the lake. 
38|The man from whom the demons had left 
kept on begging him if he could be with him from then on. But he sent him away saying, 

39|“Go back home and tell all about what God did for you.” He went throughout 
the entire city proclaiming and preaching what Jesus did for him.
          
40|While Jesus was returning, the crowd kept on welcoming him 
enthusiastically, beckoning him. The fact is, all of them were waiting for him to return. 

41|Out of nowhere, a man named Jairus, and this man was one of the leading me 
of the synagogue, fell at Jesus’s feet asking him—begging him—to come to his house, 

42|since his only daughter, who was around twelve years old, was near death.
      While he was heading there, the crowd kept on throttling him. 
43|A woman 
with a hemorrhage[B], who had it for the last twelve years, and who spent her entire life-
savings on doctors, no one being able to cure her, 
44|got right up behind him and 
touched the tassel on his outer cloak, and immediately her hemorrhage ceased. 

45|Jesus said, “Who touched me?” While everyone was denying having done it, 
Peter said, “Boss, the crowd is crowding in on you non-stop and squeezing you.” 

46|Jesus said, “Someone touched me; you see, I’m aware of the fact that miraculous 
power has gone out of me.” 
47|Seeing that she hadn’t escaped notice, the woman, 
trembling, came and prostrated herself before him and announced for all to hear the 
reason she touched him and how she was healed instantly. 
48|He told her, 
“Ma’am, your faith has come to the rescue[h] for you. Go in peace (i.e., go your way free of 
conflict, duress, or affliction).”
          
49|While he was still speaking, a particular person from the synagogue 
leadership came saying to Jairus, “Your daughter has died; you don’t need to bother the 
teacher anymore.” 
50|Jesus heard this and responded to him, “Don’t be afraid; just 
believe and she’ll be rescued from this calamity[h].” 
51|He entered the house and 
didn’t allow anyone to enter with him, except for Peter, John, and James, and the child’s 
father and mother. 
52|Everyone kept on crying and kept on pounding their chests 
in a gesture of grief. He said, “Don’t cry; the fact is, she’s not dead—she’s just asleep.” 

53|They started ridiculing him, having known for certain that she had died. 

54|He, though, took her hand and called to her loudly, “Young lady, get up!” 

55|Her spirit returned to her, and she was resurrected immediately. He left 
instructions that she be given something to eat.

&LUKE 9
1|Having summoned the Twelve, he gave them supernatural power and 
authority to cure a person of any kind of demon which is harassing him and to cure 
diseases. 
2|He sent them out[a] as missionaries to go about preaching and proclaiming 
God’s plan of being involved with mankind (God’s kingdom) and to heal the sick. 

3|He said to them, “Don’t pack anything for the road: don’t take a staff nor a travel 
pack nor food nor cash nor a change of clothes[b]. 
4|If you’re invited to stay at a house, 
stay there for a while, and then leave that place[A]. 
5|Whoever has knowingly chosen 
not to receive you—whole-heartedly take you in and embrace your message—while 
departing from that city, shake the dust off your feet in the same way that a key witness 
would testify in court against them.” 
6|Entering and leaving, entering and leaving, they 
proceeded to go through each and every town telling the good news and curing people 
everywhere they encounter those asking for it.
          
7|The ruler Herod[c] heard everything which had happened and was quite 
perplexed on account of what was being said by some, that John was raised from the 
dead, 
8|but by some that Elijah has appeared, but by others that the prophet so-and-
so from way-back-when came back to life. 
9|Herod said, “I beheaded John myself, so 
who is this guy that I’m hearing such things about?” He was ever trying to see him.
          
10|When they returned, the missionaries told him all about the things that 
they did. Taking them with him, they withdrew, he and them only, to a city called 
Bethsaida. 
11|Knowing this, the crowd followed him. Welcoming them, he 
proceeded to speak to them about God’s involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) 
and proceeded to heal those needing a cure. 
12|The day was winding down, so the 
Twelve approached him and said,
      “Dismiss the crowd, so that they can go into the surrounding towns and farms, 
retire for the night, and find provision, since we’re out here in the middle of nowhere.”
          
13|He said to them, “You all give them something to eat.”
      They said, “We don’t have any more than five loaves of bread and two fishes, 
unless of course we go and buy food for these people.” 
14|You see, there were 
around five thousand men there (not counting women and children). He said to his 
disciples,
      “Have them find a nice place to relax and gather into dinner parties of about fifty 
apiece.”
          
15|They did this, and everyone found a place to relax[d]. 
16|He took the 
five loaves and two fishes, looked up into the sky, gave thanks for them, broke the 
bread[e], and proceeded to give the loaves and fishes to his disciples to distribute to the 
crowd. 
17|Everyone ate until they were full, as much as he or she wanted, and 
twelve baskets of leftover scraps were picked up by them.
          
18|Now on one occasion, he happened to be praying alone and his disciples 
came over and joined him. He posed a question to them,
      “Who do the crowds say that I am?”
          
19|They answered, “John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Yet others say that 
you’re some prophet from way-back-when who’s come back to life.”
          
20|He said to them, “Who do you all say that I am?”
      Peter replied, “God’s Messiah, the Christ.”
          
21|He got them to promise[f] not to spread this fact around to anyone: 

22|he said that the Man[g] must undergo a lot of suffering and be rejected after 
examination by the councilmen[h], the chief priests, and the designated teachers[i], be 
killed, and be resurrected on the third day after. 
23|He went on to tell everyone, “If 
anyone wants to follow in my footsteps[B], let him deny himself by picking up[j] his cross 
every day, and let him follow me. 
24|You see, he who knowingly and willfully 
wants to keep intact his self, his life-being, destroys it. He who mindfully and willingly 
destroys his self, his life-being, on behalf of me, this fellow keeps it intact. 
25|So 
now, how does it benefit a person who, after gaining the whole world (i.e., after great 
accomplishments), destroys or suffers the loss of his own self? 
26|You see, he who 
knowingly and willfully is ashamed of me and my words, the Man will be ashamed of 
this person, when he comes in his, his Father’s, and the angels’ glory. 
27|Mark my 
words—there are some who managed to get to stand right here, who will not taste 
death until they get to see God’s master plan (God’s kingdom)—absolutely won’t.”
          
28|About eight days after he spoke these words, he took Peter, John, and 
James[C] with him and ascended a mountain for a session of prayer. 
29|While he 
was praying, his facial appearance happened to change, and his clothes also changed to a 
lightning-like white. 
30|Just like that, two men began to converse with him, none 
other than Moses and Elijah, 
31|who were visible in their glorious magnificence, 
beginning to speak to him about his departure from the Earth, which was going to be 
fulfilled in Jerusalem. 
32|Peter and those with him were dead asleep[k], but snapped 
out of it and became wide awake and saw him in his magnificent splendor and the two 
men standing together with him.
          
33|While they were parting with him, Peter said to Jesus, “Boss, good thing 
we’re here. Let’s make three little holy edifices[l], one for you, one for Moses, and one for 
Elijah”—not having any idea what he was saying. 
34|While he was still saying this, 
a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. Fear came upon them as they entered into 
the cloud. 
35|A voice appeared out of the cloud saying, “This is my Son, the 
Chosen-From-Among-Many One[m], evermore listen to him.” 
36|With the voice’s 
appearance, they noticed that Jesus was now alone. For days to come they kept their 
mouths shut and wouldn’t tell anyone what they had witnessed.
          
37|A large crowd met him the sixth day after they descended the mountain. 

38|Out of nowhere, a man yelled out from the crowd, “Teacher, I’m begging you to 
take a look at my son, since he’s the only son I have…”— 
39|Just like that, a demon 
spirit takes hold of him, screams all of a sudden, and throws him into a convulsion, 
foaming at the mouth, hardly leaving him even for a moment, battering him all the 
while. 
40|—“…Your disciples were asked to cast it out, and they weren’t able to.” 

41|Jesus’s response this was, “Oh, this disbelieving, corrupt Zeitgeist[n]! Just how 
long do I have to hold your hand[o] and put up with you? Bring your son over here to 
me.” 
42|They then brought him over to him; the demon threw him to the ground, 
and convulsed him. Jesus dropped the hammer on the filthy, disgusting spirit , the child 
was cured[p], and they gave him back to his father. 
43|Everyone was amazed at the 
magnificence of God.
      While everyone was still marveling at everything he was doing, he said to his 
disciples, 
44|“As far as you all are concerned, however, get this into your head[q]: 
the way things are headed, the Man is going to be betrayed and is going to be taken into 
custody by sinners.” 
45|But this remark wasn’t getting through to them. It had 
been hidden from them, kept locked up as a secret from them, so they weren’t seeing it 
for what it was, and from time to time when they thought about this remark were afraid 
to ask him about it.
          
46|Now an argument arose between them, namely which one of them is the 
greatest. 
47|Jesus, understanding what was at the heart of the issue, got ahold of a 
child, had him stand next to him, 
48|and said to them, “Whoever willingly receives 
this child—that is, wholeheartedly welcomes him and considers him to be one of his 
own—as part of his Christian duty[r] receives me, and whoever willingly receives me 
receives the One who sent me. The fact is, the one among you at the lowest station in 
life—this person is great.”
          
49|Upon reflection, John said, “Boss, we saw some people casting out 
demons as though they were authorized and commissioned to do so by you[s], and time 
and time again we prevented them or otherwise hindered them from doing so, because 
their initiative didn’t originate from us[t].” 
50|He said to John, “Don’t hinder them. 
The fact is, he who isn’t opposed to us is on our side.”
          
51|As those days were coming to a close, the days before his ascension, in 
his inner self he mustered an unwavering determination for going to Jerusalem and 
enduring the hardships there[D]. 
52|He sent out some agents to the places he was 
intent on going and was expecting confrontation[E]. In their comings and goings, they 
went into the towns of Samaria as part of their making preparations for him, 

53|but they didn’t whole-heartedly welcome him and embrace his ministry[u] there, 
because he was bent on going to Jerusalem[v]. 
54|When his disciples witnessed this, 
James and John said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from the sky and 
incinerate them?” 
55|He turned and scolded them, 
56|and they went to 
another town instead.
          
57|While they were on the road, someone said to him, “I’ll follow you 
wherever you decide to go.” 
58|Jesus said to him, “The foxes have dens and birds 
have nests, but the Man doesn’t have any such place to get away from it all[w].” 

59|He said to someone else, “Be my follower[x],” but he said, “Lord, let me first go 
out and bury my father[F].” 
60|He said, “Let the dead bury their own dead; you, 
though, go out and proclaim God’s involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) all 
over the place.” 
61|He said to someone else, “I’ll be your follower, Lord, but first 
let me say farewell to close friends and family.”

1|After these things happened, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent 
them out in sets of twos as probes[a] into every city and place which he personally 
intended to visit. 
2|He started his talk by saying to them, “The harvest is large indeed, 
but the workers are few. Therefore, ask the Harvest Chief if he would catapult workers 
out[b] into his harvest— 
3|Get going!
      “Take note: I’m sending you out like lambs in the midst of wolves. 
4|Don’t 
carry a wallet, a travel pack, or sandals, and don’t take too kindly to anyone while on 
the road. 
5|Now, whatever house you happen to enter, first say, ‘I offer peace to this 
house’ (i.e., I extend my offer of friendship to all in this house and my willingness to get along 
with you). 
6|If there happens to be a son of peace there (i.e., if the leader of the house 
willingly and joyfully engages in friendships and will gets along well with people), your offer 
of piece will stick. Otherwise, it’ll bounce back to you[A]. 
7|Stay in that very house, 
eating and drinking that which they have on hand; you see, the worker is entitled to his 
wage[c]. Don’t hop from house to house. 
8|If you happen to go into a city and they 
receive you—whole-heartedly welcome you and embrace your ministry—eat those 
things which are put in front of you.
          
9|”Heal those in the city who are rundown with an illness of some sort and say 
to them, ‘God’s involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) is here and now and 
within reach[d].’ 
10|But should you go into a city and they won’t receive you, on 
your way out, make a statement in its town squares and on its boulevards, 
11|and 
wipe off the dust from the city that’s clinging to your feet symbolic of you being through 
with them. In any event, understand this, that God’s kingdom is here and now and 
within reach. 
12|Mark my words: on That Day, it will be more tolerable for Sodom 
than for that city.
          
13|”You’re in deep trouble, Chorazin! You’re in deep trouble Bethsaida! 
Because if the miracles which occurred among you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, 
those cities would’ve done the burlap-and-ashes thing[B] and had a change of heart and 
of conduct[e]. 
14|In any event, on That Day, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and 
Sidon than for you. 
15|As for you, Capernaum,

“You won’t be elevated all the way to heaven
You will descend all the way to hell


16|”He who listens to you listens to me, and he who disregards you disregards me, 
and he who disregards me disregards the One who sent me.”
          
17|The seventy-two returned full of joy saying, “Lord, even the demons 
obey us when we act using your delegated authority[f].” 
18|He said to them, “Time 
and time again I saw, like a lightning strike, a demon get ejected from his spiritual 
dominion.[C] 
19|Realize this: I have given you the authority to walk over serpents 
and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will harm you, not 
even a bit. 
20|However, don’t get too excited about the fact that they obey you, but 
rejoice that you have clout in the spiritual world[g].”
          
21|At that moment he was filled with rapture in the Holy Spirit[h] and said, 
“I pour my heart out in confession to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you 
hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to children. Yes 
indeed, Father, I am enraptured because the way things turned out is to please Your 
intense and profound scrutiny[i]. 
22|All things have been given to me by my Father, 
and no one knows who or what the son is except the Father, and who or what the 
Father is except for the son and except for whomever the son might choose to reveal it 
to.” 
23|He turned and faced the disciples and said to them alone, “Blessed be the 
eyes that see what you see. 
24|I’ll tell you this much: many prophets and kings 
desired to see those things which you see and didn’t get to see them, and to hear those 
things which you heard and didn’t get to hear them.”
          
25|As chance would have it, some expert in the Law of Moses stood up and 
put him on the spot saying,
      “Teacher, what must one do to legitimately claim and lay hold of[D] that special 
fullness of life (eternal life[E])?”
          
26|He said to him, “What’s been established in writing and thereby decreed 
by the Law of Moses?”
          
27|His response to him was, “’You shall love the Lord your God from out of 
your entire heart, with your entire mind, will, and emotions[j], with your entire ability 
and might, and with your entire intellect.’ Also, ‘You shall love your neighbor as 
yourself.’”
          
28|He said, “You answered correctly. Do this and you shall have eternal 
life[k].”
          
29|But wanting to vindicate (or exculpate) himself, he said to Jesus, “So who 
is my neighbor?”
          
30|Jesus formulated[l] a reply for him: “There was a certain man who was 
heading to Jericho from Jerusalem, and robbers jumped him, stripped him of everything 
of value, beat him up, and left him there half-dead. 
31|By chance, some priest was 
on that very road heading in the same direction[m], and when he saw him passed by him 
on the opposite side of the road. 
32|A local clergyman[n] came too, and when he 
saw him, likewise passed by him on the opposite side of the road. 
33|But someone 
who was travelling—a Samaritan—ran across him, and when he saw him felt deeply 
sorry for him. 
34|He came and dressed his wounds, applying lotion and 
disinfectant[o], put him on his own donkey, led him to an inn, and took care of him. 

35|The next day he handed the innkeeper cash for a couple weeks’ stay[p] and said, 
‘Look after him. If his bill happens to run over, I personally will pay you back on the 
return trip.’ 
36|Which one of these three do you suppose had succeeded in 
becoming a neighbor to the one who got jumped by the robbers?” 
37|He said, “The 
one who had pity on him.” Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”
          
38|While they were travelling about, he himself and not just his disciples 
entered a certain town. A woman named Martha was entertaining him, 
39|and this 
woman had a sister named Mary, who moreover was sitting near the Lord attentively[q], 
listening on and on to his message. 
40|But Martha was constantly being distracted 
by what was involved in the preparations and waiting on everyone. She went straight 
up to him[r] and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me with all the 
work[s]? So now, say something to her to get her to help out.” 
41|His response to 
her was, “Martha, Martha, you worry about so many things and get upset about them. 

*[a]as probes…Lit: before his face. A common idiom; ref. note of Luke 9:52.
*[b]catapult workers out…Lit: cast workers out
*[c]the worker is entitled to his wage…Or: the worker is worthy of his keep. A phrase used repeatedly 
throughout the NT, originating in the Law of Moses, a principle well-known to all Jews.
*[d]God’s kingdom is here and now and within reach…Lit: God’s kingdom has come near you
*[e]had a change of heart and of conduct…Lit: repented
*[f]when we act using your delegated authority…Lit: in your name. Also used in Mark 16:17.
*[g]that you have clout in the spiritual world…Lit: that your names are written in heaven
*[h]he was filled with rapture in the Holy Spirit…Lit: he was exalted in [or by] the Holy Spirit
*[i]your intense and profound scrutiny…Lit: before you. Short for before your face or similar to in your 
sight: phrases used throughout the Bible.
*[j]mind, will, and emotions…Lit: soul
*[k]and you shall have eternal life…Lit: and you shall live. Based on the context, the latter phrase is 
understood to mean the former.
*[l]formulated…Lit: undertook.
*[m]heading in the same direction…The GT specifies that the man who was assaulted was going “down” to 
Jericho from Jerusalem, and that the priest was also going “down” as well. As a NT rule, one goes “up” 
to Jerusalem and goes “down” from Jerusalem. Based on this, the priest was travelling in direction of 
Jerusalem.
*[n]clergyman…Lit: Levite. Some liberties taken.
*[o]applying lotion and disinfectant…Lit: pouring oil and wine. Some liberties taken.
*[p]he handed the innkeeper cash for a couple weeks’ stay …Lit: he gave two denarii to the innkeeper. 
Some liberties taken. Two denarii is $200 according to the conversion in Matt. 18:28. A “couple weeks” 
is a crude estimate; relative to modern times, inns wouldn’t have been cheaper back then than they are 
today.
*[q]sitting near the Lord attentively…Lit: sitting at his feet
*[r]went straight up to him…Also: abruptly went over
*[s]work…Lit: serving
 
*[A]And if there happens to be a peaceful soul there, your offer of piece will stick. Otherwise, it’ll bounce 
back to you…Lit: And if a son of peace happens to be there, your peace will rest upon it. Otherwise, it will 
return to you. Notice the figurative language here in this passage, and, in fact, starting at the end of the 
previous chapter. Sprinkled throughout this discourse are Semitic idioms, expressions, etc. (son of peace 
is a good example). These appear to be literal word-for-word translations from Aramaic to Gk. of Jesus’s 
actual Aramaic words. In general, Luke uses less Semitic wording than Matthew, but there’s a noticeable 
difference here in this passage and in the previous chapters of Luke.
*[B]done the burlap-and-ashes thing…Lit: sitting in sackcloth and ashes. Ref. note of Matt. 11:21.
*[C]Time and time again I saw, like a lightning strike, a demon get ejected from his spiritual dominion…Lit: I 
was watching (imperfect tense) Satan fall from heaven like lightning. Luke 10:18 is one of the most 
misinterpreted verses in the NT. It is commonly understood to be Satan being cast out of heaven prior to 
the creation of man (ref. Is. 14:12; Ez. 28:16; Rev. 12:7–9). This is not the case. Instead, Jesus is seeing in 
the spiritual world (ref. “discerning of spirits”, 1 Cor. 12:10) what the seventy-two who had been sent 
out were doing in the natural world. Jesus was watching in real time; each time they cast out a demon, 
he saw a lightning strike.
The elements to the correct interpretation of this passage, first, is that the word translated was 
watching is in the Gk. imperfect tense. In this case, it insinuates multiple, repeated action, not a single 
action; plus it insinuates Jesus watching something unfold in real-time (in other words, watching 
concurrently as the disciples were doing it). Second, the Gk. word for heaven 
(ouranos/οὐρανός/Strong’s 3772) can mean either the sky (Acts 1:1), heaven itself (Luke 10:14), the 
spiritual world around us (1 Cor. 12:2; Eph. 6:12), or a place of spiritual dominion. In the case of Luke 
10:18, ouranos means the third: a place of spiritual dominion. Third, the word Satan is used as a 
synecdoche/metonymy for the word demon (also in Matt. 12:26; Luke 13:16). Fourth, the word fall 
refers to somebody or something losing its authority or dominion, usually by force (Rev. 18:2; Rev. 12:7–
9).
The correct interpretation of Jesus seeing multiple demons get cast down in real-time is relevant to the 
enclosing context. In other words, Jesus sent the disciples out, and in v. 17 they come back rejoicing, 
telling what had happened. Jesus regurgitating something which happened thousands of years before 
would be irrelevant and incongruous to the remark his disciples just made.
*[D]legitimately claim and lay hold of…Lit: inherit. To inherit or the inheritance or simply possess refer to 
the same biblical concept. The concept of the inheritance is that God has a specific place He has 
reserved for you, that you have claim to, and He promises to bring you to it (inheriting) and to keep you 
in it (salvation), and to restore you to it should you lose it (redemption). The concept of the inheritance 
starts in the OT with God promising Abraham a land, not only to him but to his descendants, and this 
land is eventually subdivided into continuously smaller pieces, down to individual, single-family lots. 
Such subdividing of the land is enumerated in Joshua chapters 13–22. Though the concept of the 
inheritance begins with God communicating to His man, His tribe, His people that He has promised them 
a portion of land, it then extends into the journey to get to that land and to the obedience required to 
take possession of that land. Some examples: Ps. 37:9,29; Prov. 10:30; Is. 14:21; Is. 57:13; 60:21). The 
concept is applicable beyond land to anything God promises a believer to have, which in the case of v. 
25 refers to eternal life.
*[E]eternal life…This phrase is used throughout the NT, particularly in the Gospel of John. From the face-
value meaning of the words, eternal life would appear to mean life after death, but there are a couple of 
problems with that interpretation. First, the OT, and by extension Judaism, emphasizes the here-and-
now and de-emphasizes life after death, to the point where some Jews (the Sadducees) didn’t even 
believe in life after death. Second, Jesus said in v. 28, “Do this and you shall live.” He’s talking about the 
here-and-now, not the life to come. This leaves the unanswered question: what exactly does the NT 
mean by the phrase eternal life? The answer comes from reading all the passages that talk about eternal 
life, reading them with an understanding that it’s talking about the here-and-now, not life after death, 
and meditating on the evidence. The answer will then present itself.
[F]To choose the one good thing is what’s needed. You see, Mary considered her options and made the 
best choice; the very thing she chose will not be taken away from her…Lit: Of one thing is there need. For 
Mary chose the good part, whatsoever will not be taken away from her. The rendering is not entirely 
certain. Max & Mary claim that of one thing is there need is short for the Semitic idiom of few things is 
there need or of one. It’s universally agreed that the word good is to be translated best. An inference is 
made with the word part, that it is one of many. Put together, it’s assumed that this paints a picture of 
Mary choosing between good and bad options.

&LUKE 11
1|He happened to be praying somewhere, and just as he finished one of his 
disciples said to him, “Lord, teach[a] us how to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” 

2|He said to them, “When you pray, say,

“Father, may You be revered for who You are
And for Your reputation[b].
Have Your involvement with us (Your kingdom) come.

3|Give us a meal ticket each day.

4|Forgive our sins.
You see, we, for our part, also forgive everyone
Who has a negative score on our scorecard[c].
May you not transport us to temptation—
Temptations and trials that would break us.”

          
5|He said to them, “All of you probably have a friend like this, someone you 
were to go to in the middle of the night and say, ‘Hey good buddy, I need to borrow 
three loaves of bread, 
6|since my friend was on the road and stopped by unexpectedly, 
and I don’t have anything to put on the table,’ 
7|and good-old-so-and-so there on the 
inside replies, ‘Don’t bother me. I’m locked up for the night, and my children are all 
tucked in[A]; I can’t get up to get you something.’ 
8|I’m telling you, even if he won’t get 
up because he’s your friend, he sure will get up because of your relentlessness and give 
you anything you need. 
9|This is me talking now—ask, and it will be given to you; 
seek and you will find; knock, and it will be opened for you. 
10|You see, everyone 
who asks receives, who seeks finds, who knocks gets doors opened. 
11|Can you 
think of any father you know of whose son asks him for a fish and gives him a snake 
instead of a fish? 
12|Or for an egg and gives him a scorpion? 
13|So now, if the 
lying, cheating, stealing, selfish, etc. people[d] out there have the sense to give good gifts 
to their children, how much more will the Father give from heaven above a spirit which 
is indeed the Holy Spirit to those asking Him[B]?”
          
14|He was in the middle of casting out a deaf demon (i.e. a demon of deafness)[C], 
and it so happened that when the demon left, the deaf man spoke. The crowd was 
amazed. 
15|But some of them said, “He casts out demons by the head demon 
himself, Beelzebub.” 
16|But others, testing him in order to expose a fault, time and 
time again were trying to get him to perform a spectacular miracle[e]. 
17|He, 
though, cognizant of the inclination behind their thoughts, said to them, “Every 
kingdom split into factions which are pitted against each another[f] will fall into 
oblivion, and an organization pitted against the organization itself will fall. 
18|Now 
if Satan’s dominion[g] is also divided into factions pitted against each other, how will his 
kingdom maintain working order[h], seeing that you claim that I’m casting out demons 
with the assistance of Beelzebub? 
19|So if what I’m doing on my end is casting out 
demons by using Beelzebub’s assistance, with whose assistance do your protégés[i] cast 
out demons[D]? By means of this dilemma, what they do on their end will determine 
whether you’re right or wrong about your claim[j]. 
20|Now if I’m casting out the 
demons by The Touch of God[k], then God’s involvement with mankind (God’s 
kingdom) is here-and-now and in your face[l].
          
21|”When a man who’s armed to the hilt[E] guards his own fenced-in 
property, keeping an eye on it at all times, his possessions remain undisturbed. 

22|As soon as a man more powerful than him assaults him and subdues him, he 
confiscates the weapons and armor[E] upon which he had relied and distributes his 
possessions to his partners in crime. 
23|Whoever or whatever is not with me is 
against me, and whoever or whatever’s not contributing to my cause detracts from it[m].
          
24|”When the archetypical filthy, disgusting spirit leaves a person, it goes 
throughout places which are uninhabitable or inhospitable[n], seeking a place to take a 
break or to settle in, at least for a little while,[o] and doesn’t find any.[F] Then it says, ‘I’ll 
go back and reenter my home, the domicile from where I left.’ 
25|It comes and finds 
that it’s been all tidied up and that everything’s been put back in order. 
26|Then it 
goes and takes with it a complete set of other spirits[p], ones more evil than itself, and 
they enter and take up residency there, and that poor guy ends up being in worse shape 
than when he started.”
          
27|It so happened that, when he was in the middle of saying these things, a 
woman lifted her voice over the crowd, “Blessed be the womb that carried you through 
pregnancy and the breast that breast-fed you.” 
28|He, though, said, “On the 
contrary—blessed be those who hear God’s word and guard and watch over it in order 
to keep it.”
          
29|As the crowd built up more and more, he proceeded to say, “This 
prevailing Zeitgeist[q] in particular is one of evil. It seeks a spectacular miracle, but none 
such will be given to it except for Jonah’s miracle. 
30|You see, just as Jonah became 
a sign from God to the Ninevites, in the same way the Man[r] too will be a similar type of 
sign from God to those adhering to this Zeitgeist. 
31|The Queen of Sheba will be 
called to testify on Judgment Day taking a stand and confronting the men who adhere 
to this Zeitgeist[s] and will condemn them with her testimony, because she came from the 
other side of the planet to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and, take note of this: something 
greater than Solomon is in this very place. 
32|The men of Nineveh will be called to 
testify on Judgment Day and will take a stand and confront this Zeitgeist and those who 
adhere to it and will condemn it with their testimony, because they had a change of heart 
and mended their ways because of Jonah’s preaching, and take note of this: something 
greater than Jonah is in this very place.
          
33|”No one who has lit a lamp places it in the cellar or under a basket but 
instead places it upon the lampstand so that it provides light for those entering. 

34|Your eye (i.e., what’s got your attention and you’re fascinated with) is your body’s 
source of light, its lamp. When your eye can see clearly, your entire body becomes 
illuminated also. When it sees poorly (i.e., when you’re fixated on bad things), your body 
becomes dark also. 
35|So now, see to it that the light in you not in fact be darkness. 

36|So now, if your entire body is filled with light, not having any part of it which is 
dark, it will be illuminated entirely like when the typical lamp by its sheer brightness 
illuminates everything around you.”
          
37|During the talk, the Pharisees asked him if he would dine with them, so 
he entered the house where the dinner was being held and had a seat at the table[t]. 

38|Seeing this, the Pharisees were stunned because he hadn’t first been immersed 
in water before the meal. 
39|The Lord said to them, “Right around now[G], you 
Pharisees—you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but your insides are filled to 
the brim with avarice[H] and iniquity. 
40|Stupid people. Didn’t He who made the 
outside of the cup also make the inside? 
41|Just give away what’s on the inside like 
you’re giving a gift to charity, and—presto—you can handle anything that’s off-limits 
from a ritualistic perspective.[I]”
          
42|”Enough of that—you’re in for it Pharisees, because you donate a small 
percentage of your[u] mint and rue and of every herb imaginable, and overlook or flat-
out ignore the judgment and the love of God; you know you’re supposed to do these 
things, but those things don’t seem to materialize. 
43|You’re in for it Pharisees, 
because you love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the greetings in the 
marketplace and town-square. 
44|You’re in for it, because you are like the Out-of-
Sight-Tombs: the people who walk over top of them are unaware of them.”
          
45|One of the experts in the Law of Moses[v] then retorts, “Teacher, these 
words insult us as well.” 
46|Jesus said, “You’re in for it too, you Law experts, 
because you saddle people with burdens that are too great to bear; you, meanwhile, 
won’t even lift a finger to attempt to bear the same burden. 
47|You’re in for it, 
because you erect the prophets’ tombs, but it was your predecessors[w] who were the ones 
who killed them. 
48|Consequently, you affirm[x] and approve of your predecessors’ 
actions, because they on the one hand killed them, but you on the other hand erect 
tombs in the prophets’ memory. 
49|For this reason, God in His wisdom[y] said,

“I’ll send prophets and missionaries[z] to you,
And you will kill and persecute
Select ones from among them


50|”…Resulting in those adhering to this Zeitgeist being held accountable for[aa] the 
blood of all the prophets which has been poured out since the dawn of civilization, 

51|from the blood of Abel all the way to the blood of Zechariah, who perished 
between the altar and the temple itself. Yes indeed, I’m telling you what, those who 
adhere to this prevailing Zeitgeist will be held accountable for it. 
52|You’re in for 
it, experts, because you took away the key of knowledge; you, as far as your own selves 
are concerned, won’t join in[bb] with knowledge, and you forbid or otherwise hinder those 
in the process of joining.”
          
53|After he left the house, from there on out, the experts in the Law and the 
Pharisees held a terrible grudge against him, and over and over tried to get him to make 
off-the-cuff remarks, questioning him about many things, 
*[a]teach…Verb tense specifically means, run through an entire set of lessons
*[b]may You be revered for who You are and for Your reputation …Lit: let your name be hallowed
*[c]has a negative score on our scorecard…Lit: owing us
*[d]if the lying, cheating, stealing, selfish, etc. people out there…Lit: if you existing as evil know
*[e]spectacular miracle…Lit: sign from the sky
*[f]split into factions which are pitted against each other…Lit: divided upon itself
*[g]Satan’s dominion…Lit: Satan. A metonymy.
*[h]maintain working order…Lit: stand
*[i]protégés…Lit: sons
*[j]By means of this dilemma, what they do on their end will determine whether you’re right or wrong 
about your claim…Lit: on account of this, they themselves will be your judges. The protégés acting as 
judges is a figure of speech.
*[k]The Touch of God…Lit: God’s finger
*[l]is here-and-now and in your face…Lit: has arrived upon you
*[m]not contributing to my cause detracts from it…Lit: not gathering together with me scatters. The 
metaphor of gathering and scattering is workers going out into a harvest field and gathering grain.
*[n]places which are uninhabitable or inhospitable…Lit: dry places
*[o]seeking a place to take a break or to settle in, at least for a little while…Lit: seeking rest
*[p]a complete set of other spirits…Lit: seven other spirits. This is more figurative than literal, as the 
number seven in the Bible signifies completion.
*[q]prevailing Zeitgeist…those adhering to the prevailing Zeitgeist…Lit: this generation…generation
*[r]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[s]The Queen of Sheba will be called to testify on Judgment Day taking a stand and confronting the men 
who adhere to this Zeitgeist…Lit: the Queen from the south will be raised up in the judgment with the 
men of this generation
*[t]had a seat at the table…Lit: reclined
*[u]donate a small percentage…Lit: tithe
*[v]experts in the Law of Moses…Later in v. 53, these are identified as the Scribes.
*[w]predecessors…Also: ancestors. Lit: fathers.
*[x]you affirm…Lit: you are witnesses
*[y]God in his wisdom…Lit: the wisdom of God. A figure of speech.
*[z]missionaries…Lit: apostles
[aa]held accountable for…Lit: required of
[bb]join in…Lit: enter in. An idiom; ref. note of Act 19:8.

*[A]my children are all tucked in…Lit: my children are with me in the bed. The GT hints that the parents and 
children are sharing the same bed, and if the friend could not get out of bed without stirring the children 
also.
*[B]how much more will the Father give from heaven above a spirit which is indeed the Holy Spirit to those 
asking Him…Two points to make concerning the rendering here. First, The principle manuscripts differ in 
the addition or omission of a single letter which changes the rendering somewhat. The rendering of the 
accepted GT reads, the from-heaven-Father will give; the alternate GT reads, the Father will give from 
heaven. Second, the omission of the definite article in Holy Spirit. Although the words for Holy Spirit 
occur in forms throughout the NT in both using and not using the definite article, in this context the 
omission of the definite article indicates the nature of the gift which the Father is giving, that the nature 
of the gift is good and never bad, and that if He’s giving the gift of a spirit, you can rest assured that it is 
none other than the Holy Spirit.
*[C]casting out a deaf demon (i.e., a demon of deafness)…Other manuscripts read, was casting out a 
demon, and it itself was deaf. The majority of the principle manuscripts read the former and not the 
latter. The demon was a type of harassing spirit that causes deafness.
*[D]with whose assistance do your protégés cast out demons?…The only answer the skeptics could give to 
this question is that their protégés don’t rely on anyone’s help to cast out demons, because they do not 
nor ever will cast out demons. They’re questioning where Jesus is getting the ability to cast out demons; 
Jesus is asking why they don’t have any ability to cast out demons. Jesus goes on to say that whatever 
the answer to this question happens to be will decide whether he (Jesus) is getting help from God or 
from Beelzebub.
*[E]a man who’s armed to the hilt…Lit: the fully-armed strong man. The GT says the strong man instead of 
a strong man in the same way that John 10:10 reads, the thief (both are a figure of speech). Also, the GT 
emphasizes the fact that the man is wearing armor, as v. 22 literally reads, he takes away the armor 
upon which he had relied, instead of, he takes away the weapons and armor upon which he had relied. It 
is the armor which turns the man a strong man, more so than the weapon he wields. His armor (and 
presumably a weapon to go along with it) makes him nearly invincible against someone who’s simply 
armed but is wearing no armor.
*[F]seeking a place to take a break or to settle in, at least for a little while, and doesn’t find any…Ref. note 
of Matt. 12:44
*[G]Right around now…The GT suggests that the Pharisees used to clean their cups and plates before each 
meal, likely making a ceremony out of it, and Jesus was noticing them doing it and for that reason drew 
up a metaphor of it as they were about to do it.
*[H]avarice…Lit: the Gk. word harpagay (ἁρπαγή/Strong’s 724). This word refers to a physical item: a hook 
used to draw a bucket out of a well or a garden rake of some sort, something used to gather brush. In 
both cases, the purpose of the physical object is that of gathering and pulling something in. In the 
context of this passage here in Luke, and perhaps for most usages, harpagay is the pulling in of non-
material things, immorally so. It applies not only to wealth but to fame and to other things. Therefore, 
harpagay can alternately be translated covetousness, greed, or rapacity. In addition to the word 
harpagay, the Gk. word in the NT more frequently rendered covetousness or greed is pleonexia 
(πλεονεξία/Strong’s 4124), which is from the root word pleon (πλείων/Strong’s 4119), which means “too 
much.” Pleonexia is defined as, “a disposition to take more than one’s share”; in addition to meaning 
covetousness and greed, pleonexia can also mean, “something one feels forced to do.” Pleonexia is the 
compulsion to gather an inordinate amount of material goods; harpagay is the gathering of such things, 
or the gathering of fame and the like. The word used in 1 Tim. 3:3 for “not covetous” is aphilarguros 
(ἀφιλάργυρος/Strong’s 866), which broken down from its concatenated roots is, not-a-comradely-love-
of-silver. Since silver means money, it is better rendered, not-a-comradely-love-of-money.
[I]Just purge yourself of those things on the inside, and—presto—you can handle anything that’s off-limits 
from a ritualistic perspective…Lit: But rather give those inner things, alms, and behold all things are clean 
to you. The phrase give those inner things, alms appears to be an expression or perhaps even an idiom, 
and its meaning is inferred from the context. It’s assumed that this phrase is a metaphor that compares 
the purging of what’s on the inside to someone giving alms.

*[I]Just purge yourself of those things on the inside, and—presto—you can handle anything that’s off-limits 
from a ritualistic perspective…Lit: But rather give those inner things, alms, and behold all things are clean 
to you. The phrase give those inner things, alms appears to be an expression or perhaps even an idiom, 
and its meaning is inferred from the context. It’s assumed that this phrase is a metaphor that compares 
the purging of what’s on the inside to someone giving alms.

Luke

catch him in something which he blurted out of his mouth which was wrong.


&LUKE 12
1|As the crowd was aggregating into the thousands, to the point where they 
were stepping on each other, first and foremost he started off by speaking to his 
disciples, “Beware of the yeast (i.e. the hypocrisy) of the Pharisees. 
2|Nothing’s been 
concealed that won’t be revealed, nor secret that won’t be made known. 
3|Instead of 
what you speak being only in the darkness, it will be heard in the light; and that 
whispered in the ear will be preached on the rooftops.
          
4|”I’m speaking to you my close friends: don’t be afraid of those who kill the 
body but can do nothing further. 
5|I’ll show you who to be afraid of: fear him who, 
after killing, has the authority to commit one to hell. Oh yes, I’m telling you—fear that 
person. 
6|Don’t five sparrows sell for $6[A]? And not one of them has been forgotten in 
the forefront of God’s mind[a]. 
7|Not only so, but all the hairs of your head have been 
counted. Don’t be afraid: you’re worth more than a bunch of sparrows.
          
8|”I’m telling you, everyone who’s willing to confesses their allegiance with me 
in front of people, the Man[b] will also confess his allegiance with him in front of God’s 
angels[B]. 
9|But he who denied me in front of men will be denied before God’s angels. 

10|And everyone who speaks a word against the Man will be forgiven of doing it. 
But he who speaks a word against the Holy Spirit, having blasphemed, will not be 
forgiven.[C] 
11|Now, when they haul you before the councils, rulers, and 
authorities, don’t worry about what how or in what way you’ll defend yourself or what 
you’ll say. 
12|You see, the Holy Spirit will instruct you in that moment as to what 
you must say.”
          
13|From out of the crowd someone said, “Teacher, tell my brother to split 
the family inheritance with me.” 
14|He said, “Mister, who appointed me judge or 
arbiter over you all?” 
15|He said to them, “Be on the lookout for and protect 
yourself from any sort of[c] greed (grabbing at what’s more than your portion in life), 
because in the pursuit of excess possessions, one’s life is not derived from what’s 
accumulated.”
          
16|He told them an analogy, “Some rich man owned land from which he 
reaped a windfall harvest. 
17|He thought things over to himself, ‘What am I going 
to do, since I have no place to store my bumper crop?’ 
18|So he thought, ‘I’ll do 
this: I’ll tear down my barns, build bigger ones, and store all the grain and goods there. 

19|And I will say to my soul, ‘Soul, you have set aside lots of goods for many years 
to come. Take it easy, party, and have a good time[d].’ 
20|But God said to him, 
‘Fool—the Grim Reaper is coming for you[D] this very night. Now everything you saved 
away: who’s it going to go to?’ 
21|This is the same way it’ll be for him who 
stockpiles stuff for himself and is not acquiring wealth in the things of God[e].”
          
22|He said to his disciples, “For that reason I’m telling you: don’t let your 
mind and emotions[f] be anxious about what you’re going to eat or if you’re going to 
have any clothes to wear. 
23|The fact is, your life draws sustenance from more than 
just food and your body draws sustenance from more than just clothing. 
24|Take 
note of the crows; the reason is because they don’t sow or reap grain, they have neither 
pantries nor barns, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds? 

25|Which one of you worriers can add a minute to your lifespan[g]? 
26|So now, 
if you can’t do the least thing about it, why worry about the things which come up from 
day to day[h]? 
27|Take note of how the lilies grow: they neither toil nor spin thread. 
I’m telling you, not even Solomon in all his majesty and splendor was decked out like 
one of them. 
28|Now if God clothes the grass in a field in such a way that it exists 
today and tomorrow gets tossed into a furnace, how much more will he clothe you, little-
faithers? 
29|And as far as you’re concerned, don’t go about seeking what to eat and 
drink, and don’t dwell in angst. 
30|You see, people all over the world seek after 
these things, and your Father knows that you need to partake of them. 
31|Only, 
seek a relationship with Him (His kingdom), and these things will be added to you. 

32|Don’t be afraid of that swarm of difficulties that engulfs you[E], since your 
Father is more than happy to interact with you (give you the kingdom). 
33|Sell[F] 
your belongings and make[F] a donation to charity[i][F]. Make[F] yourselves wallets that 
will never need to be replaced due to age, an inexhaustible storehouse in the spiritual 
world, where a thief can’t get anywhere close to nor can moths ruin. 
34|The fact is, 
where your storehouse is where your heart will be also.
          
35|”Be poised for action[j] and keep your eyes peeled[k]. 
36|In your case, 
you are just like fellows waiting for when their boss might return from a wedding 
extravaganza, so that when he knocks, they would be able to respond immediately to 
open the door for him. 
37|How much goodness and praise those servants will 
receive[l], those whom the boss finds alert and vigilantly keeping an eye on everything. 
I’m telling you the truth, that he’ll put on his work clothes[m], seat them for dinner, and 
make an appearance to wait on them. 
38|And if per chance he were to show up late 
in the evening[n] or if per chance in the middle of the night[o] and find them alert and 
ready in this manner, how much goodness and praise those servants will receive. 

39|But understand this: if the one responsible for running the house knew what 
time the prowler was to be expected, he wouldn’t have let his house get burglarized. 

40|As far as you’re concerned, get yourselves ready, because the Man is coming 
quite unexpectedly.”
          
41|Peter said, “Lord, are you directing this analogy at us only or at 
everyone?” 
42|The Lord said, “Just who now matches the profile of being that 
faithful—and wise—person who runs the household, the one whom the boss will put in 
charge of his staff in order for him to pass out their food rations at the proper intervals? 

43|Goodness and praise be to that servant whom the boss will come and find 
things getting done the way they’re supposed to. 
44|You can count on this: he’ll 
put him in charge of all his possessions. 
45|But if that servant were to, deep down, 
think to himself, ‘My boss has been detained,’ and proceeds to go about slapping the 
younger, lower-ranking servants around, partying[p], and getting drunk, 
46|that 
servant’s boss will come on an unexpected day and at an unfamiliar time of the day and 
will rip him to shreds[q], and he will be treated from there on out like all the other good-
for-nothings[r]. 
47|So if that servant, the one who’s familiar with what his boss 
wants, doesn’t get his act together or does whatever he feels like, he will receive a 
severe beating. 
48|But he who’s not familiar with what his boss wants, but, based on 
what he did, deserves to be beat, will receive a mild beating. Everyone to whom much 
has been given, much will be sought from, and to whom much has been entrusted, 
more and more will be asked of.
          
49|”I came to set the world ablaze[s], and I want nothing more than for the 
fire to have already been lit. 
50|I have to undergo an all-consuming, totally 
transformative event[G], and how will I contain myself[t] until such time when it does in 
fact finish? 
51|Do you suppose I came to this world to distribute peace throughout 
the planet?—No, I’m telling you, not that, but something divisive instead. 
52|You 
see, from now on, there will be an organization[u] of five pitted into factions: three 
against the other two and the two against the three. 
53|A father will be against his 
son…

“…And a son against a father,
Mother against daughter,
And daughter against mother,
Mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law,
Daughter-in-law against his mother-in-law”

          
54|He proceeded to address the crowd as well, “When you see a certain 
cloud appearing in the West, without hesitation you say that a thunderstorm’s coming, 
and it happens the way you said it would. 
55|And when a south wind blows, you 
say that there’ll be a heat wave, and it happens. 
56|Hypocrites—you know how to 
discern the patterns of land and sky[v], but you don’t know how to discern this present 
age[w]?
          
57|”And now why do you also not decide amongst yourselves what’s the 
right thing to do[x] about a dispute?[H] 
58|In connection with that, in the steps of 
going through a legal action, from the very beginning make every effort to settle out of 
court with the opposing litigant, lest it gets to the point where he takes you before the 
judge, the judge rules against you, and you get thrown into debtor’s prison[I]. 

*[a]in the forefront of God’s mind…Lit: before God. A common OT phrase.
*[b]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt 8:20.
*[c]any sort of…Lit: all. This is a figure of speech called a synecdoche and is similar to the words all evil in 1 
Tim. 6:10, the love of money is the root of all evil.
*[d]Take it easy, party, and have a good time…Lit: rest, eat, drink, and rejoice
*[e]in the things of God…Lit: unto God
*[f]mind and emotions…life…Lit: soul
*[g]add a minute to your lifespan…Lit: add a cubit to his lifespan. Applying cubits, a unit of length, to 
lifespans, measured in time, is idiomatic. This is similar to the use of the word inch, a unit of length, in 
the idiom within an inch of his life, like in: he had been beaten to within an inch of his life.
*[h]the things which come up from day to day…Lit: the things remaining. Assumed to be an expression.
*[i]make a donation to charity…Lit: give an alm
*[j]Be poised for action… Lit: let your loins be gird about. A biblical expression.
*[k]keep your eyes peeled…Lit: keep your lamps burning
*[l]How much goodness and praise those servants will receive…Lit: Blessed be those servants. Same 
wording as Matt. 5:3–10; Luke 6:20–22.
*[m]he’ll put on his work clothes…Lit: he will gird [his loins]. A biblical expression.
*[n]late in the evening…Lit: in the second watch. Approximately 10pm to 1am.
*[o]in the middle of the night…Lit: in the third watch. Approximately 1am to 4am.
*[p]partying…Lit: eating and drinking
*[q]rip him to shreds…Lit: cut him in two. Same expression used in Matt. 24:51. This is an hyperbole.
*[r]he will be treated from there on out like all the other good-for-nothings…Lit: his portion will be placed 
with the unfaithful.
*[s]I came to set the world ablaze…Lit: I came to cast fire upon the earth
*[t]contain myself…Also: constrain [myself]
*[u]organization…Lit: house
*[v]you know how to discern the patterns of land and sky…Lit: you know to discern the face [countenance] 
of the land and of the sky. Jesus speaks as though the land and sky are living beings which decide by 
themselves what the weather will be, and that their thoughts can be understood by their facial 
expressions.
*[w]this present age…Lit: this season
*[x]decide amongst yourselves what’s the right thing to do…Lit: judge upon yourselves the right thing, or, 
judge against yourselves the verdict. There’s an implication of forced arbitration in what’s decided as the 
word upon is the same word rendered against in vv. 52, 53.

*[A]Don’t five sparrows sell for $6…Lit: Don’t five sparrows sell for 2 coins [valued at 1/10 drachma apiece]. 
1/10 of a drachma is a small-currency coin and is equal to 1/16 of a denarius. See note of Matt. 18:28 for 
denarius conversion.
*[B]God’s angels…Certain angels surround the holy presence of God, who in addition to closing off 
visibility to Him, act as attendants, courtiers, servants, and the like. They form a king’s court of a sort, 
and just like in mediaeval or ancient times ambassadors or others, when they had an audience with the 
king, had an audience with his entire court and not just with the king alone. Often, matters submitted to 
the king were submitted to the entire court, with the king presiding over it, and the court would vet and 
argue the matter for the benefit of the king, with the King presiding over the interrogation and giving his 
final word at the end. Jesus saying that he’ll confess or deny a person in front of God’s angels means 
that he is doing so in God’s court, the formal venue to present matters which God presides over.
*[C]Holy Spirit, having blasphemed, will not be forgiven…Ref. note of Mark 3:29 concerning the 
unforgiveable sin, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
*[D]the Grim Reaper is coming for you…Lit: they demand your soul from you. The literal rendering uses 
(howbeit by implication) the word they, and in addition the word demand is in the active voice, not 
passive. This usage could have one of two meanings. First, it could be an obscure reference to angels 
whose job it is to appear at the time of death and escort a person from this life to the next life, whether 
to heaven or to hell. Or second, it could be a tongue-in-cheek reference to some sort of ancient 
superstition of mythological creatures who appear at the appointed time of death to escort a person 
somehow.
*[E]that swarm of difficulties that engulfs you…Lit: the little flock-ette (to mikron poimnion, 
τὸ μικρὸν ποίμνιον), (τὸ /Strong’s 3588),( μικρὸν /Strong’s 3398), (ποίμνιον/Strong’s 4168). Usage here 
is strange and is assumed to be an expression or an idiom. Therefore, the meaning is not presumed to 
be the word-for-word literal interpretation; the exact meaning of this expression is inferred from the 
context. Some notes on the grammatical construct of this expression in the GT:
1. The appearance of the definite article (to) precludes this phrase from being in the vocative case; it 
must therefore be accusative
2. The word poimnon (ποίμνιον/Strong’s 4168) is the diminutive form of poimnā (ποίμνη/Strong’s 4167). 
Diminutives are likely candidates for usage in expressions.
3. The use of the adjective micron is somewhat redundant considering that poimnon is already a 
diminutive, and by implication describes something small.
4. Preceded by the definite article, the adjective is attributive and not predicative, which makes it more 
likely to be an expression.
3. The use of the definite article means that Luke is referring to something specific.
*[F]Sell…make…make…The verb tense used here (the aorist) for these imperative verbs insinuate a few 
things. First, this tense is more emphatic than the default tense (the present). Second, it implies a one-
time action. The one-time action of selling and giving doesn’t mean that there won’t be subsequent 
times in which this must be done, but it means that one doesn’t have to sell one’s belongings every time 
one accumulates belongings. Jesus is being emphatic to get them to break a mindset of hoarding 
possessions, hoarding them for fear of not having enough in a time of need.
*[G]I have to undergo an all-consuming, totally transformative event…Lit: I have a baptism to be baptized 
[in]. This verse (Luke 12:50), along with 1 Cor. 10:2 and with the accounts of John the Baptist, shed light 
on what the word baptism means in the Bible, and consequently what it is for a Christian to be baptized. 
In Luke 12:50, the baptism Jesus is referring to is his death and resurrection. In 1 Cor. 10:2, the nation of 
Israel was baptized into Moses by the cloud and the sea. And John the Baptist’s baptism was one of 
repentance. These passages on baptism reveal the following: Baptism is a totally transformative event. A 
person’s post-baptism life is changed entirely with respect to his pre-baptism life. The person being 
baptized enters into a binding contract, a covenant, of some sort. In order to undergo the 
transformation associated with baptism, the person being baptized must surrender his life to the 
transformation. After the baptism, the covenant which the person entered into is subject to terms, 
terms not only for the one baptized but also for God. God commits Himself to terms which consists of 
promises, and though a person is bound by the terms of the covenant, on the other hand he benefits 
from the terms God commits to, acquiring the promises. This baptism-covenant pattern summarizes 
Christianity: a total commitment by the one being baptized to the terms of the covenant (God’s 
commandments); access through faith to the promises of God (found in the Bible) which protects one 
from the depravations of life.
*[H]And now why do you also not decide amongst yourselves what’s the right thing to do about a 
dispute…In this parable, Jesus tells his followers that each person should objectively consider both sides 
of a dispute he’s embroiled in, and determine if his opponent’s case is stronger than his own. Jesus is 
teaching them to impartially weigh the merits of both sides of the case. He repeats this point in a 
different parable in Luke 14:31. But in addition to objectively considering both sides to an argument, 
what Jesus says in vv. 57–59 is that once you weigh both sides of a dispute, you’ll find that your case is in 
fact the weaker of the two, and that being the situation, it would behoove you to settle the dispute 
between just the two of you and not let it go before a judge and have him settle it instead. This parable 
has several applications, the first application is that one is better “settling out of court” and receiving 
the remission of sins offered by Christ and not attempting to prove one’s own righteousness based on 
works in a courtroom before God, where the verdict will be against you. Another application is walking 
in the Spirit rather than walking in your plain self. If you weight the evidence, you’ll find that plain-self, 
as it turns out, is dominated by the carnal nature, and as such cannot fulfill the lofty requirements of the 
Christian life. Christians should recognize that living their life apart from the indwelling Spirit is a losing 
proposition and should seek to redress the problem as soon as possible.
[I]where he takes you before a judge, the judge rules against you, and you get thrown into debtors’ 
prison…Lit: where he hauls you before the judge, and the judge hands you over to the bailiff, and the 
bailiff throws you into prison. Some liberties taken. Up until modern times, if one couldn’t pay the fine 
or penalty meted out by a court settlement, then that person was thrown in prison (debtors’ prison) 
until he could pay. The problem, of course, is that once in prison, the debtor is no longer free to earn 
money to pay the fine or penalty requisite to get out of prison. Unless someone else pays it or they cut 
you a break on the settlement terms, you’re stuck. And this is the point Jesus makes in v. 59: once 
thrown in prison, you’ll get not breaks on the settlements and you’ll ever get out.

you owe towards the judgment.”


&LUKE 13
1|Now during that same timeframe, some people who were present were 
telling him the news about the Galileans whom Pilate was responsible for their being 
slaughtered[a]. 
2|He thought about it and replied, “Do you suppose that these 
Galileans were worse sinners than any other Galilean who has ever lived, because they 
died this awful way[b]?— 
3|Certainly not. I’m telling you, put that aside—if every one 
of you won’t change your ways for the better[c], you’ll perish same as they. 
4|Or, those 
eighteen over in Siloam whom the tower fell on top of and killed: do you suppose that 
any single one of them had racked up a list of sins[d] greater than anyone living in 
Jerusalem?— 
5|Certainly not. I’m telling you: put that aside—if every one of you 
won’t change your ways for the better, you’ll perish same as they.”
          
6|He proceeded to tell them this analogy: “Someone had planted a fig tree in 
his garden[e] and came every now and then looking for figs and hadn’t found any. 
7|So 
he said to the gardener, ‘Got an issue. For three years now I’ve been coming out to look 
for figs produced by this tree and haven’t found any[f]. So now, chop it down, so that we 
don’t waste the space and deplete the soil.’ 
8|The gardener considered things and 
replied, ‘Boss, leave it be this year as well; meanwhile, I’ll dig around it and put down 
fertilizer, 
9|and we’ll see if it produces figs in the coming year. But if it doesn’t, you 
can cut it down[g].’”
          
10|On multiple Sabbaths he was teaching in one of the synagogues. 

11|Attention was directed to a woman who had had a filthy, disgusting spirit for 
eighteen years, who was bent over and wasn’t able to straighten herself out anymore. 

12|Seeing her, Jesus called over to her, “Woman, you have been released from your 
illness[h].” 
13|He laid his hands on her and immediately she was restored and was 
glorifying God and glorifying God. 
14|The head of the synagogue considered what 
had happened and became indignant that Jesus treated someone on the Sabbath. He 
proceeded to tell the crowd, “There are six days in the week in which work can be done; 
so then, go treat people on those days and not on the Sabbath.” 
15|The Lord 
replied, “Hypocrites, will not every single one of you unfetter his ox or donkey from the 
stall and lead him out to drink water on the Sabbath? 
16|This woman—and what’s 
more she’s a descendant of Abraham[i]—whom Satan has bound—get this—ten and 
eight years[A]—ought she not be unfettered from this bondage on this day in particular, 
namely the Sabbath?” 
17|Saying these things, all those opposing him were 
humiliated, and the entire crowd began to rejoice over all the wonderful things he was 
causing to happen.
          
18|Thereupon he proceeded to say, “To what is God’s involvement with 
mankind (God’s kingdom) comparable to? And what will I make comparison of it to? 

19|It’s comparable to a mustard seed, which a person took and stuck it in a garden 
by itself, and it grew up and assumed the form of a tree, and the birds nested among its 
branches.” 
20|Again he said, “To what is God’s kingdom comparable to? 

21|It’s comparable to bread yeast, which a woman took and buried in a large 
mixing bowl-sized batch[j] of dough, hidden from sight, until which time the entire batch 
fermented.”
          
22|He travelled throughout continuously, teaching from city to city and 
town to town, making his way to Jerusalem. 
23|Someone said to him, “Lord, sure 
are just a few people being saved (i.e., repenting, receiving healing, having demons cast out 
of them), aren’t there?” He told them, 
24|”Strive—and in doing so contend—to enter 
through the narrow door, because—I’m telling you—many will try to enter and won’t 
be able to do so. 
25|The moment the one in charge of the house decides it’s time to 
make the last round for the evening[k] and shuts the door, from then onwards, if some 
people proceed to stand outside and knock on the door and say, ‘Chief, open the door for 
us,’ then he’ll answer, ‘You need to get your head straightened out[B].’ 
26|Then 
those people proceed to say, ‘We ate right in front of you, in your very presence, and 
drank too, and you taught in our plazas.’ 
27|He’ll say this to them, ‘You need to get 
your head straightened out. Get away from me, the lot of you, practitioners of wrong-
doing.’ 
28|There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth[l], at that time when 
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets connected with God’s involvement with 
mankind (God’s kingdom) will be seen. Those people, though, get the boot[m]. 

29|Folks will come from the North, South, East, and West[n] and will have a place 
set for them at the dinner table[o] when God’s plan for mankind is revealed (in the 
kingdom of God). 
30|And get a load of this: the last will be first and the first last.”
          
31|About that time, some Pharisees arrived telling him, “Go now, get away 
from here, because Herod wants to kill you.” 
32|He told them, “Go tell that fox, 
‘I’ll be casting out demons and ministering[p] healings today and tomorrow and will 
finish up the next day. 
33|Nevertheless, I have to get away from here today, 
tomorrow, or[q] the next day, since it isn’t possible for a prophet to be annihilated 
outside Jerusalem.’ 
          
34|”Jerusalem…Jerusalem…she who kills the prophets and stones to death 
those sent to her: how often I wanted to gather your inhabitants[r] to myself in the same 
way that a hen gathers her own chicks under her wings, and you wanted nothing to do 
with it. 
*[a]whom Pilate was responsible for their being slaughtered…Lit: whom Pilate mixed the blood with their 
sacrifices. It’s assumed that this is an idiom; it’s hard to tell what the exact meaning is.
*[b]because they died this awful way…Lit: because they suffered these things
*[c]change your ways for the better…Lit: repent
*[d]had racked up a list of sins…Lit: owe. Same root word used in Matt. 6:12 for trespasses (as in forgive us 
our trespasses).
*[e]garden… Lit: vineyard. Some liberties taken.
*[f]and haven’t found any…Lit: and I’m not finding
*[g]you can cut it down…Lit: you will cut it down
*[h]illness…Lit: weakness
*[i]This woman—and what’s more she’s a descendant of Abraham…Lit: this woman being a daughter of 
Abraham
*[j]a large mixing bowl-sized batch…Lit: three seahs. A seah is an ancient Jewish measurement; three 
seahs are equivalent to 27 quarts/25 liters.
*[k]decides it’s time to make the last rounds for the evening…Lit: would be arisen
*[l]weeping and gnashing of teeth…Ref. note of Matt. 8:12
*[m]are getting the boot…Lit: But you are being cast out outside. The redundant out outside is an 
expression and a figure of speech.

*[o]have a place set for them at the dinner table…Lit: recline
*[p]ministering…Lit: affecting

*[s]Just like that, your cohesive metropolis is left to your own undoing…Lit: Behold, your house is being left 
to you
*[t]at the Lord’s behest…Lit: in the Lord’s name

*[A]ten and eight years…This is the literal rendering of the GT. In v. 18, Luke writes eighteen as single 
word, then when quoting Jesus here in v. 16 he writes ten and eight instead of the shorter eighteen. The 
longer form is a word-for-word translation from the Aramaic which Jesus spoke into Gk., and is preceded 
by the word behold (rendered get this). Together, the words behold and ten and eight emphasize how 
long she had been afflicted.
[B]you need to get your head straightened out…Lit: whence are you? The phrase whence are you is an 
expression, the keyword being whence (pothen, πόθεν/Strong’s 4159). This expression also appears in 
John 7:27–28 (three times); John 8:14 (somewhat); John 9:29–30; John 19:9. The expression roughly 
corresponds to the English, where are you coming from? Alternately, it may mean, what are you all 
about?; what’s your driving motivation?; what makes you tick?; what’s your raison d’être?; I don’t know 
if you’re on the level; you’re a wacko. On another note, this phrase is repeated in v. 27. The principle 
manuscripts differ in the reading. The accepted reading is lit. I don’t know you, whence you are; but 
other principal manuscripts read I don’t know whence you are. The latter is a shortened version of a 
well-known expression, readily understood and registered as such by the hearer because of the 
conspicuousness of the word whence.

35|Just like that, your cohesive metropolis is left to your own undoing[s]. I 
tell you, there’s no way whatsoever that you’ll see me until you happen to say, ‘Blessed 
is he who comes at the Lord’s behest[t].’”


&LUKE 14
1|He happened to go to the house of some high-up Pharisee for a meal[a] on the 
Sabbath, and they were watching every step that he made. 
2|As it turned out, 
somebody there right in front of him was afflicted with dropsy. 
3|Jesus thought a bit 
and said to the experts in the Law of Moses[b] and to the Pharisees, “Is one allowed or 
not allowed to heal on the Sabbath?” 
4|They kept silent. He laid hold of him, healed 
him, and let him go. 
5|He said to them, “Which one of you who owns a donkey or 
cow that falls into a well won’t pull him out right away if it’s on a Sabbath?” 
6|They 
weren’t able to refute this.
          
7|He proceeded to tell an analogy to the guests, mindful of how the places of 
honor at the table, those seats reserved for the most important guests, were being 
considered and chosen. 
8|“When you happen to get invited by someone to a 
wedding, don’t take the seat of honor, lest some other guest be regarded as more 
important than you, 
9|and the host has to say to you, ‘This place is taken’; and then 
you’ll be fixin’ to occupy[c] the least prestigious place in humiliation. 
10|Instead, 
when you happen to get invited, go and seat yourself[d] at the least prestigious place, so 
that when the host happens to come by, he’ll tell you, ‘Dear friend, upgrade to a more 
prestigious seat.’ Then it will be a cause for you to receive adulation and congratulation 
in front of all the guests[e], 
11|because all who exalt themselves will be abased and 
those who abase themselves will be exalted.”
          
12|He proceeded to speak to the guests, “When you happen to host a 
luncheon or a dinner, don’t invite your close friends, your brothers and sisters, your 
relatives, or your rich neighbors, lest they also choose to reciprocate, and it becomes 
self-benefiting to you. 
13|Instead, when you host a reception, invite the poor, the 
crippled, the lame, the blind… 
14|And it’ll be a blessing, because they won’t have 
anything to pay you back with. You see, your compensation will be in the life-to-come 
of those who are right with God[f].”
          
15|Upon hearing these things, one of the fellow guests said to him, “Blessed 
be whoever has a meal[a] while a participant in God’s plan (in God’s kingdom).” 

16|He said to him, “Some man threw a huge dinner feast and invited many people. 

17|At the start of the dinner, he sent his servant and said to those invited,
      “’Come, everything’s ready’.” 
18|They began to make excuses, one after 
another.
      “The first said to him, ‘I bought a field, and I have to go out and look it over. I 
ask to be excused.’
          
19|”Another said, ‘I bought five oxen yokes, and I’m going out to inspect 
them. I ask to be excused.’
          
20|”Another said, ‘I got married[g], and because of that, I won’t be able to 
make it.’
          
21|”After making the rounds, the servant told his boss these things. Then 
the one sponsoring and hosting the event[h] became furious and said to his servant, 
‘Quickly now—go to the boulevards and alleys in the city and to the poor, crippled, 
blind, and lame and direct them here.’ 
22|The servant said, ‘Boss, I did what you 
told me to, and there’s still empty places.’ 
23|The boss said to the servant, ‘Go out 
to the highways and interstates[i] and make them come, so that my hall[j] would be filled. 

24|I’ll tell you this much: not a single one of those people who were invited will 
taste even a morsel of my dinner’.”
          
25|Large crowds gathered around him, and he addressed them. 
26|”If 
someone comes to me and doesn’t have complete disregard for[k] his own father, 
mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, and even more his own life-being, can’t be 
my disciple. 
27|Whoever won’t bear his own cross[A] and follow in my footsteps[l] 
can’t be my disciple. 
28|To the point, show me a person who wants to construct a 
tower who doesn’t sit down at a chair ahead of time and calculate the cost, to see if he 
has enough to complete the project, 
29|lest he lay the foundation and not be able to 
complete everything? All the onlookers will begin to make fun of him 
30|saying, 
‘That guy began construction but wasn’t able to bring things to completion.’ 
31|Or, 
which king, who when maneuvering his army encounters another king facing off to 
engage him in battle, won’t beforehand sit at the table and hold council to see if with 
10,000 troops he can go head-to-head against 20,000 and win? 
32|But if it turns out 
that he can’t, while he’s still a good distance off, he’ll send a senior officer to sue for 
peace. 
33|Consequently, it’s the same way: if there’s any one of you won’t part 
with all of his own possessions, he can’t be my disciple.
          
34|”So now, the salt source works well[B]. 
*[a]a meal…Lit: eats bread. A restricted meal that fits within the restrictions of the Sabbath, as drinking is 
omitted.

word scribe is not explicitly used.

*[A]bear his own cross…This is an expression, but an expression which is coincidental to Jesus’s own 
crucifixion. It means: continuously make agonizing self-sacrifices; having complete disregard for one’s 
own happiness.
[B]So now, the salt source works well…Lit: Therefore, the salt works well [or is good]. It’s uncertain how 
this should be rendered or what this is referring to (also, see Mark 9:49,50). The interpolation source is a 
best-guess. Some problems with this passage of vv. 34,35 is this. First, salt doesn’t just become insipid 
(loses its saltiness). Salt is a simple compound that doesn’t spoil like a biomass. Second, in v. 35, the 
suggestion is to not put the salt in the ground or the compost pile (lit: manure pile). Even if salt did lose 
its potency, it’s still salt, and as salt it will poison any ground or compost it’s applied to. One will never 
put actual salt in the ground or in a compost pile. There must be more to the story here.

&LUKE 15
1|All of the tax collectors and the sinners[a] were drawing near to him to listen 
to what he had to say. 
2|The Pharisees and the designated teachers[b] wouldn’t stop 
grumbling and complaining, saying that this guy heartily welcomes[c] sinners and dines 
with them. 
3|He told them this analogy, 
4|“Do you know anyone who owns a 
hundred sheep and has one of them go missing, who won’t leave the ninety-nine out in 
the middle of nowhere and go after the one that’s missing, and won’t stop until he 
succeeds in finding it? 
5|When he finds it, while rejoicing he puts it on his shoulders. 

6|Once he gets back to his place, he’ll call his friends and neighbors over and say to 
them, ‘I’m so glad and excited I found my missing sheep. High-fives![d]’ 
7|Let me tell 
you, in the same way there’ll be joy in heaven when one sinner changes his life to do 
right than for ninety-nine who are already doing right and have no need to make this 
change.
          
8|”Or, do you know any woman who has ten $100 bills[A] and one were to go 
missing, who won’t light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she 
finds it? 
9|She finds it and calls her good friends and neighbors over and says, ‘I’m so 
glad and excited that I found the missing $100 bill. High-fives!’ 
10|Let me tell you, 
the joy that occurs in the presence of the angels[B] when one sinner changes his life to do 
right is just like that.”
          
11|He said, “A certain man had two sons, and this is what he experienced with 
them[e]: 
12|The younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me my allotted 
share of the property.’ So he distributed the estate among them. 
13|Over many 
days the younger son gathered everything up, then took a journey to a far-away 
country and recklessly squandered his share of the estate there. 
14|After wasting 
everything he owned, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and it affected 
him personally, as he began to be in need.
          
15|”He went and hired on with one of the landowners in that country, and 
he sent him to his grazing lands to feed pigs. 
16|He had an urge that wouldn’t quit 
to eat the feed which the pigs were eating; nobody was giving him any food to eat. 

17|He came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired hands have 
more than enough food to eat[f], but I, however, am wasting away from hunger here. 

18|I’ll pack up, go to my father, and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against God 
and ever so much against you;[C] 
19|no longer am I worthy to be called your son. 
Treat me like I was one of your hired hands.”’ 
20|And he packed up and went to 
his very-own father. But while yet still far off, keeping himself at a distance, hesitating 
apprehensively, his father saw him and was moved to compassion deep inside and ran 
and threw his arms around his neck[g] and kissed him fervently. 
21|The son said to 
him, ‘Father, I’ve sinned against God and ever so much against you; I’m no longer 
worthy to be called your son.’ 
22|The father said to his servants, ‘Quickly now, get 
out a Premier Robe[D], bring it over here, and put it on him; and give him a ring for his 
finger and sandals for his feet, 
23|and get the fatted calf, slaughter it: we’re going 
to have a feast-celebration, 
24|because this son of mine was dead and came back to 
life, he was lost and has been found. And they began to celebrate.
          
25|”Now his older son was out in the fields. As he was drawing near to the 
house, he heard music and dancing, 
26|He summoned one of the younger servants 
and started inquiring what these things could possibly be. 
27|He said to him, ‘It’s 
because your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fatted calf, since he 
received him back in good health.’ 
28|He became enraged and didn’t want to go in, 
so his father went out and asked him nicely. 
29|He responded to his father, 
‘Look—for many years now I’ve been your servant and not a single time have I 
neglected to obey a single command of yours, and you’ve never even given me a young 
goat so that I could celebrate with my friends. 
30|When this son of yours—who 
gobbled up your estate spending it on prostitutes—came, you slaughtered the fatted calf 
for him.’ 
31|So he said to him, ‘Son, you always have been and always will be with 
me[h], and everything I own is yours[E]. 
*[a]the tax collectors and the sinners…An expression repeated throughout the Gospels; ref. note of 18:10.
*[b]the designated teachers…Lit: the Scribes
*[c]heartily welcomes…Lit: receives
*[d]I’m so glad and excited because I found my missing sheep. High-fives!…Lit: Rejoice with me, because I 
found my missing sheep
*[e]A certain man had two sons, and this is what he experienced with them…The interpolation and this is 
what he experience with them is insinuated by the verb tense of the word had (which should actually be 
was having instead) in a certain man had.
*[f]more than enough food to eat…Lit: abound of loaves of bread
*[g]threw his arms around his neck…Lit: fell upon his neck. As the words fell upon in the Bible usually refer 
to one person or party attacking another, the fervency in which the father hugged him around the neck 
is both a metaphor to attacking someone and also an hyperbole.
*[h]you always have been and always will be with me…Lit: you are with me always

*[A]$100 bills…Lit: drachma. Ref. note of Matt. 17:24 for conversion of drachmas to dollars.
*[B]in the presence of the angels…Lit: before the angels of God. The angels of God in this context are the 
angels who surround God; the joy they are having is a metonymy for God’s joy, which extends to all 
heavenly beings surrounding Him.
*[C]I have sinned against God and eversomuch against you…Lit: I have sinned unto the heaven and before 
you. The Jews say heaven as a metonymy in place of God, to avoid speaking His name. His sin was “unto 
God” but it was before his father. In the Bible, before a person means that it is something that that 
person puts their focus and full attention on, and implies that that person is ever cognizant of.
*[D]Premier Robe…ring for his finger…Like Joseph’s robe of many colors, this Premier Robe (lit: First Robe) 
here is a visible indication of ranking and status. It shows that the son is reinstated to a position of 
authority in the family, having authority over the workers who report to the father. The ring is likely a 
signet ring, one used to affix the family seal on legal documents, giving him authority to transact 
business in the father’s name, similar to a credit card or even power of attorney.
[E]everything I own is yours…This remark indicates that the older son, the faithful one, had the right to do 
anything he wanted with his father’s possessions, as his father considered that the elder son had joint 
ownership of them. Notice the word them is used in v. 12 and not the word him: he distributed the 
estate among them. This is further evidence that the father had given the faithful son full control over 
the entire estate. The older son’s problem is that he was waiting for the father to throw him a party; he 
could’ve thrown one himself.

Luke

&LUKE 16
1|He proceeded to tell something else to the disciples. “A certain man who was 
rich had an account manager[a], and accusations were leveled against this fellow to the 
effect that he was squandering and wasting his possessions. 
2|He called for him and 
said, ‘What’s this I hear about you? Explain your handling of the accounts[b]; as it 
stands, you can’t manage accounts anymore.’ 
3|So the account manager said to 
himself, ‘What am I going to do, since my boss is firing me from my account 
management position? I’m not able-bodied enough to hoe out in the fields or cultivate 
soil. I’m too proud[c] to be a beggar… 
4|I’ve figured out what I’ll do, so that when the 
time comes that I’m displaced from the management position, they just might take me 
into their houses (i.e., take me into their inner circles and make sure I’m taken care of).’ 
5|He 
summoned each of his boss’s debtors, those having delinquent accounts. He started off by 
saying to the first one,
      “‘How much do you owe my boss?’
          
6|”He said, ‘100 containers[A] of olive oil.’
      “He said to him, ‘Take your payment history record, sit down real quick, and 
write down a balance due of 50, and I’ll sign it.’
          
7|”He said to someone else, ‘How much do you owe?’
      “He said, ‘100 barrels[B] of wheat.’
      “He said, ‘Take your payment history, write down 80, and I’ll sign it.’
          
8|”The boss commended the account manager for the wrong-doing because he 
acted shrewdly; the reason being is that those who go with the flow in this awful world-
system are shrewder than those who follow the light when it comes to dealing with 
their own kind[C]. 
9|This is me talking who’s telling you to make yourself some friends 
by utilizing the Almighty Dollar used for wrong-doing[D], so that when the money runs 
out, they just might take you into the condos which are eternal[E]. 
10|He who’s 
faithful in the least thing is also faithful in many things. 
11|So now, if you haven’t 
become faithful with the Almighty Dollar used for wrong-doing, who will entrust you 
with the truth? 
12|And if you haven’t grown to become faithful in what belongs to 
somebody else, who’ll give you items of your own? 
13|No custodian[F] can work for 
two bosses; the fact is, he’ll either hate the one and cherish[d] the other, or he’ll bind to 
the one and hold the other in contempt. You can’t serve both God and the Almighty 
Dollar.”
          
14|The money-loving Pharisees were monitoring these things he was saying 
and sneered at him. 
15|He said to them, “You, however, do all the right things in 
front of people, but God knows your hearts. And He monitors them because that which is 
held in high regard and flaunted[e] among people is detestable[f] in God’s eyes. 

16|The Old Testament[g] was God’s interaction with mankind up until John; since then 
God’s interaction with mankind (God’s kingdom) is being evangelized and everyone 
heading towards it or is already inside of it is confronted with agonizing choices[G]. 

17|It would be an easier task for the known universe to come to an end[h] than for a 
single a single stroke of the pen which distinguishes one letter from another in the Bible 
to be invalidated[j].
          
18|Everyone who gets divorced and then remarries commits adultery[j].
          
19|”Now there was a certain rich man, and he was dressed in the best 
clothing like all the other rich are[k] and partied each day, living high off the hog[l]. 

20|And there was a poor man named Lazarus who camped at his gate covered in 
sores. 
21|He had a hankering to be filled up with the rich man’s table scraps; 
instead, the dogs were coming by again and again licking his sores. 
22|Now it so 
happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be in tight 
with Abraham, forever close to him[H]; the rich man also died and was buried. 
23|In 
the world-to-come[I] he lifted up his gaze, while in a state of perpetual torture, seeing 
Abraham at a distance and Lazarus in tight with him. 
24|He called over and said,
      “‘Patriarch Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus[J], so that he would 
dip his fingertip in water and cool off my tongue; because I’m tormented in this flame.’
          
25|”Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that during your lifetime you 
thoroughly enjoyed the good things in life; in the meantime Lazarus suffered the bad 
things. But now he’s being comforted here; you, though, are being tortured. 

26|And not only that, a huge chasm has been put in place between us and you all, 
resulting in preventing anyone who wants to from crossing over from our side to your 
side, nor are you able to gain access and traverse from your side to ours.’
          
27|”He said to him, ‘I’m asking you, Patriarch, to send him to the members 
of my immediate family— 
28|you see, I have five brothers—so that he would 
sternly warn them, so that they too won’t wind up coming to this place of torture.’
          
29|”Abraham said, ‘They have the Bible[m]. Let them listen to what it says.’
          
30|”So he said, ‘No, no, Father Abraham; if instead someone were to come 
back from the dead and go to them, they’d straighten up[n].’

*[j]Everyone who gets divorced and then remarries commits adultery…Lit: everyone who divorces his wife

GT is worded this way because only the husband had the legal right to obtain a divorce, not the wife.

*[A]100 containers…Lit: 100 baths. A bath is an ancient Israeli unit of measurement equivalent to 5.8 
gallons (21.9 liters). In all probability, olive oil containers like this consisted of large jars, pots, etc. of 
pottery that could hold a single bath. In today’s retail price for olive oil, one bath of olive oil would sell 
for around $240, setting the total value of all 100 baths at $23,000.
*[B]100 barrels…Lit: 100 measures. One measure was ten times larger than a bath, making a measure 
equal to 58 gallons (220 liters). For perspective, a barrel of crude oil is 42 gallons; a measure is 6 times 
larger than a bushel. In today’s prices, 100 baths (600 bushels) of wheat is valued around $3,000. Now, 
wheat production nowadays has been automated to a greater extent, relatively speaking, than other 
commodities, so the effective dollar equivalent value for us would exceed $3,000.
*[C]those who go with the flow in this awful world-system are shrewder than those who follow the light 
when it comes to dealing with their own kind…Lit: the sons of this age are more sensible [or: prudent; 
wise] over the sons of light unto their own generation. A clearer meaning of the word age as used in this 
verse can be found in Eph. 2:2.
*[D]the Almighty Dollar used for wrong-doing…Lit: the mammon of wrong-doing. The Aramaic word 
mammon used in the NT carries with it negative connotations. The word wrong-doing is a repetition of 
the “for the wrong-doing” (v. 8), as what Jesus says in v. 9 is a reference to that parable.
*[E]they just might take you into the condos [liberties taken; lit: tents or tabernacles] which are 
eternal…The wording of this sentence, along with the grammatical forms of these words, is a repetition 
of “they just might take me into their houses” ( v. 4), except tents is substituted for houses. Also, the 
word tents is a Semitic figure of speech used in the OT (like in 1 Kings 12:16) which uses words from the 
bygone-days of Israel that were bygone in Jesus’s time, as it hearkens back to the days before they were 
a nation but were nomads, like in the time of Abraham, still living in tents.
*[F]custodian…Lit: domestic servant. Not the usual words for servant, but a word having the same root as 
account manager (steward) as used in this passage. Both domestic servant and steward take care of 
someone else’s possessions. The words suggest that the domestic servant is in training or aspires to 
become a steward. As there is linking of the words for steward and domestic servant, v. 13 is a 
continuation of the parable of the steward.
*[G]is confronted with agonizing choices…Lit: suffers violence. The word for suffers violence is an idiom; 
though the exact meaning is not entirely certain, it seems to mean that a person has to make difficult 
decisions to the point of undergoing hardships, of acting decisively, of exercising his willpower to the 
uttermost extent, and of challenging his most fundamental and sacred beliefs. Ref. Matt. 11:12.
*[H]to be in tight with Abraham, forever close to him…Lit: in the bosom of Abraham. To a person to “be in 
the bosom of so-and-so” is for that person’s head to be in so-and-so’s lap while he’s reclined at the 
dinner table. Lazarus is reclined in such a way that his head is in Abraham’s lap, as John was in Jesus’s in 
John 13:23. “Abraham’s bosom” is a metaphor of close friendship, as the one who lies for a meal and 
places his head in another’s bosom is best of friends.
*[I]the world-to-come…Lit: Hades. Hades is the Greek god of mythology who’s god of the underworld. It is 
also a synecdoche for the underworld itself, the place where people go after they die. The writers of the 
NT used the word Hades in an abstract manner; in other words, they used it to refer to the place people 
go when they die. However, just because the NT uses the word Hades doesn’t mean that it concurs with 
all of what the Greeks thought of the underworld. It is simply the place where the dead go. As can be 
seen in this story, it consists of the place where both the good and the bad go after they die.
[J]send Lazarus…There is evidence that Lazarus was at one time the rich man’s servant: first, because the 
rich man recognized Lazarus at a distance; second, because he knew his name; third, the fact that 
Lazarus was stationed at his front gate, not far from where he had once lived; fourth, that the rich man 
is asking for service from Lazarus, something he was accustomed to doing while alive. As it appears, 
when Lazarus became too old or too frail to perform his duties, the rich man tossed him out on the 
street, where he had to beg for the remainder of his life. The rich man’s wealth and lavish lifestyle 
wasn’t directly responsible for his punishment in the afterlife, but the wealth and deceitful lifestyle 
fueled a disdain for his fellow man, and that ultimately is what landed him in hell. There are 
commandments in the Old Testament for showing kindness to the less-fortunate; the rich man 
disobeyed these.

31|”He said to them, ‘If they won’t listen to what the Bible says, neither

&LUKE 17
1|He said to his disciples, “Various means of getting tripped up or falling into 
sin[a] are impossible to avoid; nevertheless, it’s bad news for him through whom they 
come. 
2|He’d be better off if a millstone was tied around his neck and he was thrown 
into the sea than if he were to cause even the most insignificant person to get tripped up 
or fall into sin. 
3|Pay attention to yourselves (to yourself and to one another). If your 
comrade[b] happens to sin, chastise him; and if he changes his ways, forgive him. 

4|And if he happens to sin against you multiple times in one day, to the point where 
you’ve had enough, and each time[c] turns to you and says, ‘I’m sorry, I won’t let it 
happen again,’ forgive him.”
          
5|The missionaries[d] said to the Lord, “Boost our faith.” 
6|The Lord said, “If 
you have faith like a mustard seed, you would proceed to say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be 
uprooted and be replanted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.
          
7|”Who do you know who has a servant…a plowman or a shepherd…who will 
tell him when he just came in from out in the field, ‘Come straight on over and have a 
seat[e] at the table,’ 
8|but who’ll tell him instead, ‘Make me dinner, then put on a 
waiter’s outfit and wait on me until whenever it is I happen to finish taking my meal[f], 
and afterwards you can have a meal of your own’? 
9|Though he’ll be pleased with the 
servant, his pleasure won’t be extraordinarily high because he did everything he was 
told to do. 
10|You too, in the same way, when you manage to do everything you 
were told to do, say to yourselves, ‘We’re not effective enough as servants[g]: we’ve only 
accomplished what we were on the hook to do but kept on putting off.’”
          
11|While on the way to Jerusalem, he reached the point where he was 
starting to go through the middle of Samaria and Galilee. 
12|While he was entering 
a particular town, standing at a distance were ten men who were lepers, and these 
lepers encountered him. 
13|They raised their voices in unison, “Jesus, master, have 
mercy on us.” 
14|Seeing them, he said, “Go show yourselves to the priests[A] and 
have them confirm that your leprosy is gone now.” And it so happened as they were on the 
way that they were purged[h] of their leprosy. 
15|But one of them, seeing that he had 
been healed, returned glorifying God in a loud voice. 
16|He fell on his face at his 
feet thanking him. He, though, was a Samaritan. 
17|Jesus addressed him, “Weren’t 
there ten of you who were purged of leprosy? Where are the other nine? 
18|They 
couldn’t find it within themselves to return to give glory to God, except for this one 
fellow who’s of another nationality[B]?” 
19|He said to him, “Get up and be on your 
way. Your faith has come to the rescue for you.”
          
20|Asked by the Pharisees when God will roll out his plan for mankind 
(when God’s kingdom is expected to come), his response was, “God’s kingdom doesn’t 
come because you sit down and go over everything with a fine-toothed comb[i], 
21|nor 
should folks say, ‘Look right here and look over there[j].’ Get ahold of this fact: God’s 
involvement in your life (God’s kingdom) is within your reach, yours for the taking.”
          
22|So he told the disciples, “There’ll come a day when you’ll wake up one 
day and have the desire to be looking at the Man[k] and you won’t be able to see him. 

23|Folks will tell you, ‘Look—he’s right here,’ or, ‘Look—he’s over there’—Don’t go 
on a wild-goose chase[l]. 
24|You see, just as when lightning strikes, it flashes from 
one end of the sky to the other, the Man will be the same way[C] when his moment of glory 
finally arrives. 
25|First, though, he has to undergo tremendous suffering and be 
examined and consequently rejected by the powers that be.
          
26|Just like the way things happened back in Noah’s days, it’ll happen the 
same way when it’s the Man’s time: 
27|they were living it up[m] and living it up 
and getting married and getting married up until the day Noah went inside the ark, and 
the flood came and wiped everything out. 
28|It’ll happen the same way as it 
happened in Lot’s days: they were continuing in their day-to-day practices of living it up, 
transacting business, farming, engaging in construction projects; 
29|but the day Lot 
left Sodom, a shower of flaming sulfur[n] rained down from the sky and destroyed 
everything. 
30|It will follow the same pattern on the day the Man is revealed.
          
31|”On that day, whoever finds himself out on the back deck[D] and, 
meanwhile, has got a bunch of stuff stored away in the house in containers: don’t let him 
go in and get them. The same thing goes for the one working out in the fields: don’t let 
him turn around and go back into the house. 
32|Remember what happened to Lot’s 
wife? 
33|The one who tries to keep his life safe annihilates it, but he who’s willing 
to chance letting it get annihilated will stay alive. 
34|I’m telling you, on that 
dreadful night[E] there will be two lying on a single bed[o]: one of those two will be 
escorted away and the other will be left behind. 
35|There will be two women 
grinding flour at the same place: one of those two will be escorted away; the other will be 
left behind.” 
36|[F]
          
*[a]various means of getting tripped up or falling into sin…Lit: stumbling blocks. Ref. Matt. 18:6.
*[b]comrade…Lit: brother
*[c]multiple times in one day, to the point where you’ve had enough, and each time…Lit: seven times in 
one day, and seven times. In the Bible, the number seven is the number of completion. 
*[d]missionaries…Lit: apostles
*[e]have a seat…Lit: recline

this is an expression.

*[n]flaming sulfur…Lit: fire and brimstone. An expression used throughout the Bible. It’s a figure of speech 
where one should remove the word and between fire and brimstone.
*[o]lying on a single bed…Or possibly: two reclined [for dinner] on a single couch.

*[A]Go show yourselves to the priests…Ref. note of Matt. 8:4; see also Luke 5:14

*[C]the Man will be the same way…The principle manuscripts are split evenly on this, with the alternate 
reading, the Man will be the same way when his day arrives [lit: in his day]. The added phrase or 
something to that effect was insinuated by Luke, so the interpolation is correct, though it’s doubtful that 
these words appeared in the autograph.
*[D]out on the back deck…Lit: upon the housetop. Some liberties taken. Ancient Israeli houses had flat 
roofs, and they used their roofs like we use porches and decks. Likewise, this explains Prov. 25:24.
*[E]on that dreadful night…Lit: with this night. Verse 31 starts out with Jesus saying on that day, but now 
he’s talking about “that night” instead of “that day.” He’s actually speaking of the same day, but he 
switches to saying night to signal that something dreadful is to take place.
*[F]Verse 36 missing from the better manuscripts
[G]they said…Lit: they say. In the NT, narrative commonly switches to the present tense for effect, when 
the past tense is the true meaning. This is a figure of speech which conveys to the reader how tightly the 
sequential actions in a narrative are coupled; that things are unfolding in real-time; the continuity of a 
conversation. The present tense puts the reader in the midst of the conversation as it’s unfolding, rather 
than looking at a stale description of how it turned out.

      …And he told them, “Where the carcass is, there too the vultures will converge.”


&LUKE 18
1|He proceeded to tell them an analogy, to the effect that men must 
continuously pray, all the time, and not get tired of praying and give up, 
2|saying, 
“There was a certain judge in a particular city who didn’t reverence God and wouldn’t 
knuckle under to anyone. 
3|Now there was a widow in that city, and she started 
going up to him over and over again, telling him, ‘Issue a verdict in my favor and rule 
against my opponent at law.’ 
4|For a good while he wasn’t wanting to do so, but after 
these encounters he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t reverence God nor will I 
knuckle under to any person, 
5|on account of the aggravation that this widow’s 
dishing out, I’ll rule in her favor for sure, so that she doesn’t wind up driving me 
bonkers[a] with her incessant visitations.’” 
6|So the Lord said, “Listen closely to what a 
judge who’s corrupt to the bone[b] is saying here. 
7|So you’re telling me that there’s no 
way at all that God will decide to deliver a verdict in favor of His chosen ones, ones 
who shout out to Him day and night, making demands in a loud voice, ones that He 
patiently puts up with on a regular basis? 
8|I’m telling you that He’ll rule in their 
favor posthaste. However, will the Man[c] come and find the conviction that this widow 
had anywhere on this planet[d]—will he really?”
          
9|Now he also addressed this analogy to some who reached the point that 
they’ve convinced themselves that their life is approved by God and they live up to His 
standards (that they’re righteous) while holding everyone else in contempt: 

10|”Two men went up to[e] the temple to pray[f]; one was a Pharisee and the other 
was a tax collector[g]. 
11|The Pharisee stood[h] tall and proud while praying, and was 
praying to himself, ‘God, I thank You that I’m not like everyone else…rapacious to the 
point of extortion, unfair and a cheater, someone who sleeps around with other 
women…or even like this tax collector here. 
12|I fast twice a week, I give ten 
percent of everything I earn to the church[i].’ 
13|But the tax collector, standing back 
at a distance, in the midst of his prayer was not wanting—even in the slightest way—to 
lift up his eyes to the sky, to heaven where God lives[j], but instead kept on thumping his 
chest saying ‘God, let me—the big-time sinner—off the hook.’ 
14|I’m telling you, 
this fellow left for home with his slate wiped clean[k]—rather than that other guy—
because everyone who exalts himself will be abased, he that abases himself will be 
exalted.”
          
15|They kept on bringing the toddlers[A] to him so that he’d affect them by 
touching them. Seeing this, the disciples scolded them. 
16|But Jesus called them 
(the toddlers) over, while saying, “Don’t prevent or otherwise hinder the boys and girls 
from coming to me[B]; you see, God interacts with like kind as these[l]. 
17|Really, I’m 
telling you, whoever won’t whole-heartedly embrace God’s plan for interacting with 
mankind (God’s kingdom) the same that a boy or a girl would, there’s no way he or she 
will access it—no way at all.”
          
18|One of the rulers asked him,
      “Good teacher, what do I need to do so that I would be guaranteed to take 
possession of that special fullness of life (eternal life)?”
          
19|Jesus said, “Why do you call me ‘good’[C]? No one is good except for 
God. 
20|Are you familiar with the commandments: don’t commit adultery; don’t 
murder; don’t steal; don’t lie when asked to testify or give a deposition of some sort; 
honor your mother and father?”
          
21|He said, “These I’ve been vigilant to keep[m] since I was a youth.”
          
22|Jesus heard this and said, “Yet you’re missing one piece of the puzzle: sell 
everything you have and give the proceeds to the poor, and you’ll have treasure in the 
spiritual world, and come be my disciple[n].”
          
23|But having heard this, he became sad to the core; for he was exceedingly 
rich. 
24|Seeing him become sad, Jesus said, “Oh, how hard it is for the wealthy to get 
involved with God (enter God’s kingdom). 
25|The fact is, it’s easier for a camel to 
crouch down and crawl through a small gate portal than for a rich man to get involved 
with Him.”[D] 
          
26|Those who heard this said, “Just how can anyone avoid this?”
          
27|He said, “Those things which are impossible with people are possible 
with God.”
          
28|Peter said, “Consider this: in our case, we left what we owned and 
became your followers.”
          
29|He said to them, “I’m telling you for certain: there’s no one who’s left 
home, wife, brothers, parents, or children on behalf of a relationship with God (God’s 
kingdom) 
30|who won’t receive many times more in this timeframe and that 
special fullness of life (eternal life) in the Coming Eternal Timeframe—not a chance.”
          
31|He took the Twelve aside and said to them, “Take notice: I’m going 
down to Jerusalem, and everything that’s been written by the Old Testament prophets 
concerning the Man will be fulfilled. 
32|You see, he’ll be betrayed and taken into 
custody by Gentiles[E]. They’ll toy with him, insult him, and spit on him, 
33|and 
after giving him a flogging, they’ll kill him. The third day after, he’ll be resurrected.” 

34|They didn’t understand anything of these things and therefore this matter was 
kept hidden from them, and they kept on not comprehending the things that were 
being said, one thing after another.
          
35|Now an incident occurred while drawing near to Jericho. On the side of 
the road a particular blind man was sitting around begging. 
36|Having heard that 
a crowd was coming through, he asked repeatedly what it was all about. 
37|He 
was told that the Nazarene named Jesus was passing by. 
38|He began to shout out 
to Jesus, “You marvelous godsend[o], have mercy on me!” 
39|Those from the crowd 
who passed by scolded him repeatedly, in order to get him to keep quiet. He, though, 
even more so continued crying out, “You marvelous godsend, have mercy on me.” 

40|Jesus came to a halt and called to have him sent over to him. He came nearby, 
and he asked him,
          
41|”What can I do for you[p]?”
      ”Lord, do whatever it is that you do so that I would gain my sight.”
          
42|Jesus said, “Sight: start working! Your faith has come to the rescue[q] for 
you.”
          
*[a]driving me bonkers…Lit: striking me in the face; treating me roughly; tormenting me. An hyperbole.
*[b]a judge who’s corrupt to the bone…Lit: the judge of injustice. A figure of speech.
*[c]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[d]the conviction that this widow had anywhere on this planet…Lit: the faith [or, conviction] upon the 
earth. The assumption is made that this faith/conviction refers to the widow’s faith/conviction.
*[e]went up to…This is the literal rendering; the temple sits atop a hill that overlooks Jerusalem, which in 
turn lies in the mountains.
*[f]to pray…The verb tense used suggests that the prayer was for a predetermined length of time, such as 
a prayer ritual or a session of prayer
*[g]tax collector…Tax collectors in the NT are the stereotypical notorious sinner. Ref. note of 18:10.
*[h]stood…Lit: was stood. The passive voice of to stand is used instead of the active, a personification of 
some sort indicating that some inner conviction of the Pharisee animated him and caused him to stand.
*[i]I give ten percent of everything I earn to the church…Lit: I tithe everything I earn. Some liberties taken.
*[j]standing back at a distance, in the midst of his prayer was not wanting—even in the slightest way—to 
lift up his eyes to the sky, to heaven where God lives…Lit: standing at a distance was not wanting neither 
to lift up the eyes to heaven. The use of the word neither and saying the eyes instead of his eyes is a 
figure of speech that gives this a poetic ring.
*[k]with his slate wiped clean…Lit: having been justified
*[l]you see, God interacts with like kind as these…Lit: you see, of these such are God’s kingdom
*[m]vigilant to keep…Lit: watched carefully; guarded; protected
*[n]in the spiritual world, and come be my disciple…Lit: in the heavens, and come follow me
*[o]marvelous godsend…Lit: Son of David. Ref. Matt. 12:23.
*[p]What can I do for you?…Lit: What do you want me to do for you?
*[q]come to the rescue…Lit: saved

*[A]toddlers…Lit: babies. When Luke states in v. 16 that he called them over, the antecedent of them is the 
word babies in v. 15, and this word babies normally refers to newborns, but it’s inferred that Luke is 
referring to toddlers and not newborns, since babies are too young to respond to a person beckoning 
them to come. However, since the word babies is used, by our classification of minors from birth to 
adulthood, this would mean very young children (toddlers) rather than just children generically, since 
the word children has connotations of a minor from the age of, let’s say, four to twelve. The word used 
in v. 16 for boys and girls (paidia, παιδίον/Strong’s 3813) has a broader meaning than babies.
*[B]Don’t prevent or otherwise hinder the boys and girls from coming to me…Lit: Let the boys and girls 
come to me and don’t prevent or otherwise hinder them…The literal wording of the GT breaks apart 
what could or should otherwise be combined into a single phrase into two phrases joined by the 
conjunction and. This is a figure of speech, and since the literal wording is awkward, it’s been modified 
into a single phrase.
*[C]Why do you call me ‘good’?…Ref. notes of Matt. 19:17, Mark 10:18.
*[D]The fact is, it’s easier for a camel to crouch down and crawl through a small gate portal than for a rich 
man to get involved with Him…Lit: For it’s easier for a camel to go into through an eye of a needle than a 
rich man to enter into God’s kingdom. Ref. note of Matt. 19:24. Luke says go into through an eye of a 
needle, whereas Matthew says to go throw the eye of a needle (and they use different words for eye and 
needle).
[E]Gentiles…Also: foreigners; the nations. Jesus is pointing out that his crucifixion is even more odious 
since it’s performed by Gentiles. The Gentiles are unclean; Jews were not supposed to associate with 
them; there are promises to Israel in the Old Testament of protection from the Gentiles.

&LUKE 19
1|He entered Jericho and proceeded to pass through it. 
2|There he was, a 
man named Zacchaeus. He was employed as a chief tax collector and was rich. 
3|He 
had been trying to see Jesus, to see who he is, and from the crowd wasn’t able to because 
he was quite short. 
4|He ran out ahead in front of where the crowd was headed and 
climbed a sycamore tree so that he could see him, since that oh-so-famous fellow was 
about to pass through. 
5|As he came to that very spot, Jesus looked up and said to 
him, “Zacchaeus, quick—come down out of that tree. I have just got to stay at your house 
today, you see.[a]” 
6|He got down in a hurry and greeted him joyfully. 
7|Seeing that 
everyone was grumbling and complaining, saying that he arrived with a man who’s a 
sinner to wreak havoc, 
8|Zacchaeus stood up straight and said to the Lord, “Hey, sir: 
I’m going to give half of what I own to the poor, and anyone I’ve happened to have 
cheated, I’ll pay back four times the amount.” 
9|Jesus said to him, “Today things were 
set in good order for this family, preserved the way they’re supposed to be,[A] because 
even he is a descendant of Abraham[b] and an heir therefore to Abraham’s covenant with 
God. 
10|The fact of the matter is that the Man[c] came to seek and to save what’s 
lost.”
          
11|While still listening, he added an analogy to what he said, on account of 
him being near Jerusalem and of them thinking that he was going to bring God’s plan 
for mankind (God’s kingdom) into view imminently. 
12|So then he said, “A 
particular nobleman went to a far-away place to acquire the throne of a kingdom for 
himself and turn around and go back home without further delay once that was done. 

13|So he summoned ten servants, gave them each a $10,000 bill[B], and said to them, 
‘Invest this money in some business ventures while I’m gone.’
          
14|”Now his serfs began to despise him, and this grew into hatred for him[d]; 
they went behind his back and sent a respectable representative from the community[e] 
around saying, ‘We don’t want that guy to rule over us.’ 
15|As events unfolded in 
connection with his return from acquiring the throne, he called for those servants—the 
ones he gave the money to—to make an appearance, in order to get an understanding of 
what profits they’d generated in their business transactions. 
16|The first one 
appeared saying, ‘Sire, your $10,000 bill has compounded in growth into ten $10,000 
bills.’ 
17|He said to him, ‘Great job, you good servant you; since you’ve managed 
to be faithful with the most insignificant of things, you’re put in charge of ten cities.’ 

18|The second came saying, ‘Your $10,000 bill, Sire, has earned five $10,000 bills.’ 

19|He said to that fellow too, ‘And you get five cities.’ 
20|The third came 
saying, ‘Sire, here you go—here’s your $10,000 bill, which I’d tucked away in a 
handkerchief. 
21|You see, I was afraid of you because you’re a hard-nosed[f] man. 
You take a cut of something you never invested in and expect a return on something 
you’re not entitled to[g].’ 
22|He told him, ‘By the words of your own mouth I 
pronounce judgment upon you, you evil servant. So you knew that I’m hard-nosed, that 
I take a cut of something I never invested in and expect a return on something I’m not 
entitled to?— 
23|So now what was the reason you didn’t deposit the money in the 
bank? I could’ve gone away and come back and had it accrue interest in the interim.’ 

24|He said to the court attendants, ‘Take the $10,000 bill away from him and give it 
to the one who has ten $10,000 bills.’ 
25|They said to him, ‘Sire, he has ten $10,000 
bills…’
          
26|”’Let me tell you, to all who have it will be given, but from he who 
doesn’t have, even what he has will be taken away. 
27|However, my enemies, 
those who didn’t want me to rule over them as their king, bring them here and slay 
them right in front of me.’”
          
28|After saying these things, he proceeded to forge on ahead to Jerusalem. 

29|As it turned out, as he got close to Bethphage and Bethany to the hill named the 
Mount of Olives, he dispatched two of the disciples, 
30|telling them, “Go on ahead 
into the town across the way. Upon entering, you’ll find a colt that’s been tied up, upon 
which not a single person has ever sat. Untie it and lead it back here. 
31|If anyone 
happens to ask, ‘What’s the reason you’re untying it?’, you’re to say, ‘The Lord needs to 
take possession of it.’” 
32|The ones who were sent found things the way he told 
them they’d be: 
33|While they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, 
“Why are you untying the colt?” 
34|They said, “The Lord needs to take possession 
of it.” 
35|They led it to Jesus, and they saddled their cloaks upon the colt and 
helped Jesus mount it. 
36|On the way, people[h] started spreading their cloaks out 
on the road underneath him.
          
37|By the time they’d made their way to the downward slope of the Mount 
of Olives, the entire multitude of disciples began rejoicing, that is, praising God in a 
loud voice about everything that was going on—the miracles they had seen— 

38|saying

He’s favored!
He’s coming!
The king!
At Jehovah’s behest[C]
Peace in heaven
And glory to the max


39|From the crowd some of the Pharisees said to him, “Teacher, tell your disciples 
to cut it out.” 
40|He replied, “I’m telling you, if these people remain silent, the 
rocks will shout out.”
          
41|As he drew near, seeing the city, he wept for it, 
42|saying, “If you 
knew where things stand at this very moment in time[i]—if you just understood what 
makes for peace[j] with God—but at the present moment it’s hidden from your sight. 

43|Regarding this, there’ll come a day when your enemies will go so far as to erect 
earthen siege ramps, encircle you, and hem you in on all sides. 
44|They’ll lay you 
out flat[k]—you along with your children—and they’ll toss aside any stone stacked on 
top of another, in return for you not having recognized and understood the timeframe 
of when you get checked on to see that you’re doing what you’re supposed to do[l].” 

45|He proceeded to enter the temple and cast out the merchandisers, 

46|telling them, “It’s written, ’And my house will be a house of prayer’; you, 
though, have made it into a ‘robber’s hideout’.”
          
47|Day by day he was teaching in the temple. The chief priests and the 
designated teachers[m]—the leading men—kept on looking for a way to annihilate him, 

*[a]I just have to stay at your house today, you see…Lit: For I must stay at your house today. A figure of 
speech.
*[b]descendant of Abraham…Lit: son of Abraham
*[c]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[d]began to despise him, and this turned into hatred of him…Lit: began hating him. Ref. Rom. 9:13 for 
similar use of word hate.
*[e]a respectable representative from the community…Lit: an elder
*[f]hard-nosed…Also: exacting
*[g]take a cut of something you never invested in and expect a return on something you’re not entitled 
to…Lit: take away that which you didn’t place and reap that which you didn’t sow. Ref. Matt. 25:24.
*[h]people…Lit: they
*[i]at this very moment in time…Lit: in this day
*[j]what makes for peace…Lit: the things associated with peace
*[k]lay you out flat…Lit: dash you to the ground. Figuratively speaking, somewhat.
*[l]the timeframe of when you get checked on to see if you’re doing what you’re supposed to do…Lit: 
season of your visitation
*[m]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes

*[A]set in good order, preserved the way they’re supposed to be…Lit: salvation. This meaning of the word 
salvation builds on its usage in the OT (for example, Isa. 12:2; Jer. 3:23; Hab. 3:13), which has added to it 
additional meanings in the NT.
*[B]$10,000 bill…Lit: ten minas. Some liberties taken. A minas is a Middle-Eastern weight measurement 
amounting to 1.25 lbs. (0.57 kg) per minas, and for Jewish usage, 1 minas is equal to 100 denarii. A 
denarius is a day’s labor, or $100 (ref note of Matt. 18:28) in today’s purchasing power. However, since 
such this is pre-industrial era, the actual affect in ancient times of such purchasing power would make 
the amount seem greater. In other words, the amount would be similarly regarded as $10,000 would be 
regarded in a very poor country nowadays.
[C]he’s favored! he’s coming! the king! at Jehovah’s behest…Lit: The one being blessed, the coming one, 
the king, in the name of the Lord. Liberties taken, as this chant, originally chanted in Aramaic, was 
translated tersely into Gk. As Gk. is compact due to its uses of inflections, representing nuances in verb 
tenses, noun cases, etc., it’s impossible to render this word-for-word in English while retaining the 
succinctness that a chant requires. A chant is as much about rhythm as it is about the actual words. I 
surmise that since this was a chant, and since chants aren’t necessarily written in the same logical 
fashion as narratives are, this is one of the causes (though not the only one) for the disagreement in the 
principal manuscripts as to the precise wording of this verse.

Luke
48|but they were having trouble finding how they could pull it off; the fact of the 
matter was that all the folk-people kept on listening to him, hanging on to every word 
he spoke.


&LUKE 20
1|On one of those days, while he happened to be teaching and proclaiming 
good news[a] to the folk-people in the temple, the chief priests and designated teachers[b] 
together with the head-council’s councilmen approached him, trying to intimidate him, 

2|saying, “By what authority do you do these things? In other words, who was it who 
gave you this authority?—Tell us.” 
3|He replied to them, “I’ll answer you in just one 
sentence[c], and then you’ll tell me something in return: 
4|John’s baptism…did it 
originate from heaven or was it man-made[d]?” 
5|They reasoned together amongst 
themselves, saying, ‘If we were to say, “from heaven,” he’ll say, “why didn’t you 
believe in him?” 
6|But if we were to say “man-made,” all the folk will stone us to 
death; the fact is, they’re convinced that John is a prophet.’ 
7|They answered that they 
didn’t know where it came from. 
8|Jesus said to them, “Nor will I tell you by what 
authority I do these things.”
          
9|Now he began telling the folk this analogy: “A certain man planted a 
vineyard[A] and leased it to farmers and went on a journey for an extensive amount of 
time. 
10|When the season was right, he sent the farmers a servant, in order that 
they would give him a percentage of what the vineyard yielded. But the farmers beat him 
and sent him away empty-handed. 
11|In addition to this, he went the extra step to 
send a different servant. But they beat that fellow too. Dishonored in this way, they sent 
him away empty-handed. 
12|In addition, he went the extra step to send a third, but 
they hurt that fellow badly[e] and drove him out as well. 
13|The vineyard owner 
said, ‘What am I going to do about this?—I’ll send my Beloved Son. Surely they’ll respect 
this messenger.’ 
14|Seeing him, the farmers thought the situation through with one 
another saying, ‘This fellow is the heir: let’s kill him, so that the inheritance would 
default to us,’ 
15|and they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, 
now, will the vineyard owner do to them?— 
16|He’ll come and wipe those farmers 
out and lease the vineyard to others.” Once they heard this, they said, “Heaven 
forbid![f]” 
17|He looked at them and said, “So now, what about this verse of 
Scripture[g]:

“A rock which the inspectors inspected and rejected:
This is the one that became the main cornerstone


18|”Everyone falling upon that stone will be crumbled; whoever it happens to fall 
on, it will pulverize.[B]”
          
19|At that moment, the designated teachers and chief priests sought to lay 
their hands upon him, but they feared the folk, seeing that they knew that he targeted 
them when he spoke that analogy.
          
20|On the lookout for an opportunity, they sent agents pretending to be 
honest, decent people, in order that they might trap him in something he said, so that he 
could be taken into custody by the chief priest and placed in the jurisdiction of the 
governor. 
21|They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you’re straight-up when 
you speak and teach and that you’re not prone to partiality—not even close—you teach 
the exact truth of God’s way.”
          
22|”Do we have to pay taxes to Caesar or don’t we?”
          
23|Aware of their cunning, he said to them, 
24|”Show me a coin (a 
denarius[C])…Who’s the image and inscription of?”
      They said, “Caesar.”
          
25|He said to them, “So then, give all-things Caesar to Caesar and all-things 
God to God.”
          
26|They weren’t capable enough to trap him in any of his statements in 
front of the folk, and being in awe of his answer, they kept silent.
          
27|Some of the Sadducees (those who say there is no life after death[h]) 
approached him and asked, 
28|”Teacher, Moses wrote in the Old Testament, ‘If a 
man who has brothers and who has a wife dies childless, his brother should take the 
woman as his own wife and with his brother’s wife sire and raise a bloodline descendent. 

29|Now there were seven brothers. The first got married and died childless. 

30|The second 
31|and the third also married her, etc., up to the seventh, who 
died without leaving a child. 
32|Last of all, the woman died. 
33|In the life-to-
come, which of them will find himself married? The fact is, all seven had been married 
to her at one time.”
          
34|Jesus said to them, “Those who go with the flow in this present age[i] go 
about getting married, 
35|but those deemed worthy of attaining that blissful age to 
come—life after death, don’t you know[j]: escape from the frailty and corruption of this 
earthly body—don’t go about getting married; 
36|you see, they can’t even die 
anymore, since they’re angel-like and are reflections of God’s nature[k], being products 
of the afterlife[l]. 
37|And so, because there’s such a thing as life after death, at the 
burning bush Moses when recording the incident as he was writing the Old Testament 
pointed this out as well, as he says, ‘The Lord God of Abraham and the God of Isaac 
and the God of Jacob.’ 
38|God isn’t God of those who are dead and who therefore 
have ceased to exist, but rather of those who are living and therefore have not ceased to exist, 
seeing that, to Him, all are living and therefore still exist.” 
39|Some of the designated 
teachers thought it over and replied, “Well-put, Teacher.” 
40|The fact of the matter 
is, they no longer dared ask him anything.
          
41|He said to them, “How can people say that Christ, the Messiah, is 
David’s son?” 
42|The fact is, in the Book of Psalms David personally says,

“A Lord said to my Lord
Sit to the right of Me as my right-hand man

43|Until I decide to put your enemies under your subjugation[m]


44|”So now, David calls him ‘Lord’; how can he be his son?”
          
45|While all the folk were hearing this, he said to his disciples, 

46|”Beware of the designated teachers, those wanting to go about in robes, loving 
greetings in the marketplaces and town squares, loving the seats in the synagogue 
reserved for those who are important and the seats of honor at the special dinners. 

*[a]proclaiming good news…Also: proclaiming the Gospel
*[b]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes. Ref. note of Matt. 2:3.
*[c]I’ll answer you in just one sentence…Lit: I’ll ask you—even I a word. The literal wording is presented as 
a figure of speech. Same wording used in Luke 19:42 (Lit: if you knew in this day—even you the things 
with peace).
*[d]man-made…Lit: from men
*[e]hurt…badly…Lit: wounded
*[f]heaven forbid!…Also: may this not be!
*[g]So now, what about this verse of Scripture…Lit: what, therefore, is this [thing] which has been written
*[h]life after death…Lit: resurrection
*[i]those who go with the flow in this present age…Lit: the sons of this age. Also ref. note of Luke 16:8.
*[j]life after death, don’t you know…Lit: even the resurrection from dead
*[k]reflections of God’s nature…Lit: sons of God
*[l]being products of the afterlife…Lit: being sons of the resurrection
*[m]put your enemies under your subjugation…Lit: put your enemies under your feet

*[A]A certain man planted a vineyard…Jesus’s parable of the vineyard here is actually a variation of the 
parable in Isaiah 5:1–7. The Scribes and chief priests were caught up in the telling of the parable (v. 16 
Heaven forbid!), instead of thinking on their feet and recollecting the theme of Isaiah’s original parable, 
which they would’ve surely been familiar with.
*[B]Everyone falling upon that stone will be crumbled; whoever it happens to fall on, it will pulverize…Ref. 
note of Matt. 21:44
[C]coin (a denarius)…Lit: denarius. This was a Roman coin. The Jews were forced to use currencies from 
other nations, but in so doing were benefitting from the Roman system which supported the currency. 
As beneficiaries of this system, they were obligated to support it through taxation, the point that Jesus 
makes. In their hypocrisy, they were reaping the benefit but despising the system bestowing it.

47|Those guys devour the homes of widows and meanwhile pray long-winded 
prayers to make themselves look good. Those guys will receive quite a harsh 
judgment.”


&LUKE 21
1|He looked up and saw the rich laying their offerings on the offering plate[a] 

2|and saw a widow there who was poor put in two dollars[A], 
3|and said, “I’m 
telling you the truth—this poor widow by herself contributed more than all of the 
others combined. 
4|You see, all of these people contributed out of their abundance; she, 
however, out of her lack contributed everything she has to live on.”
          
5|While a few people were talking about the temple, the fact that with pledge-
offerings it had been adorned in beautiful stones, he said, 
6|”These things that you see 
here: there’s coming a day in which a single stone won’t be left stacked on top of another 
stone, which hasn’t been torn down.”
          
7|So they asked him, “So now, teacher, when will these things take place? And 
what will be the supernatural sign when these things are about to happen?” 
8|He said, 
“See to it that you’re not led in the wrong direction. You see, many will come claiming 
to have my authority[B] saying, ‘I am the one-and-only one[b],’ and, ‘The timeframe is right 
around the corner[c].’ Don’t go follow after them. 
9|When you hear about wars, 
conflicts, and revolutions, don’t be terrified: you see, these things have to happen 
beforehand. No, the end is not imminent.”
          
10|Then he kept on talking telling them, “Nation will be mobilized in 
hostility against nation, ethnic group against ethnic group, and kingdom against 
kingdom, 
11|plus there’ll be enormous earthquakes and famines & plagues[C] from 
place to place. There’ll be terrors, and not just terrors but great portents, signs sent from 
heaven appearing in the sky.
          
12|”But before all these things happen, they’ll get their clutches on you and 
prosecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and jails, being led away to appear 
before kings and governors on account of you acting as directed by me[d]. 

13|Circumstances will result in an opportunity for you to testify. 
14|So now, 
settle it in your hearts not to rehearse what you’ll say in defense; 
15|for I 
personally will give you rhetoric[e] and wisdom which your opponents won’t be able to 
put forth a rebuttal against or refute. 
16|You’ll be betrayed by parents and brothers 
and relatives and friends, and they’ll kill others from among you, 
17|and you’ll be 
hated by everyone because of everything I stand for. 
18|But not a single hair on 
your head will be lost—not one. 
19|By your perseverance you will stay in control 
of your lives.
          
20|”When you see Jerusalem surrounded by an army encampment, at that 
moment know that its devastation is right around the corner. 
21|At that moment, 
those in Judea: flee to the mountains; those caught in the center of it, that is Judea: get out; 
those in the surrounding areas: don’t enter the area, 
22|because it’s pay-back time, 
the day of reckoning, the fulfillment of everything recorded in the Scriptures. 

23|Bad news[f] for pregnant women when those days come around and for women 
who are breast feeding, as everything all over the place will be in really short supply 
and what with wrath being dished out on this nation of people. 
24|They’ll fall by the 
edge of the sword, and they’ll be led into captivity to all the Gentile nations, and 
Jerusalem will be utterly dominated and disrespected[g] by the Gentiles, until such a 
time as the Gentile’s allotted timeframe[h] run its course[i].
          
25|”And the sun, moon, and stars will be used for supernatural signs, while 
on earth there’ll be anguish and anxiety of nations and peoples all over the world, a 
clamor of the waves and the sea[D] in perplexity and dismay, 
26|men fainting from 
the fear and the suspense of those things coming to—being imposed on—the inhabited 
world; for the laws of physics that govern the sky above and the universe beyond will 
be perturbed[j]. 
27|At that time they’ll see ’the Man[k] coming in a cloud’ with much 
power and glory. 
28|While these things are coming to pass, pull yourselves 
together and lift your spirits[E], because your having things restored for you and your 
having things put back to the way they’re supposed to be for you is just around the 
corner[l].”
          
29|So he told them an analogy, “Observe the fig tree and for that matter all 
the trees. 
30|By the time it should have put out its shoots already, see for yourselves 
and understand that the time is already near for the harvest. 
31|In this way you 
too, when you see these thinks happening, know that God’s involvement with mankind 
(God’s kingdom) is near. 
32|I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth—this self-
same generation[m] won’t pass away until everything comes to pass. 
33|The sky and 
the earth will grow old and fade out of existence[n], but these words of mine will in no 
way whatsoever grow old and fade into irrelevance[n].
          
34|”Pay attention to yourselves, lest your hearts become lethargic, weighed 
down by binge drinking and drunkenness and by the anxieties of every-day life, and 
these days come all of a sudden and relentlessly oppress you[o], 
35|like a snare 
trapping an animal. You see, these days will come oppressively upon[o] all people 
everywhere all over the planet, those simply relaxing and keeping to themselves[p]. 

36|Be on the lookout in all the various circumstances of life and in the change in 
current events[q], praying all the while so that you would come out on top in your 
fleeing away from all these things which are going to happen, and that you would stand 
before the Man.”
          
37|He was teaching in the temple during the day, but he was leaving the city 
and spending the night on the large hill called the Mount of Olives. 
*[a]laying their offerings on the offering plate…Lit: tossing offerings into the treasury [box]. Some liberties 
taken.
*[b]I am the-one-and-only one…Lit: I am. Same wording as in Mark 13:6. Ref. note there.
*[c]The timeframe is right around the corner…Lit: the season has drawn near.
*[d]directed by me…Lit: my name
*[e]rhetoric…Lit: mouth
*[f]Bad news…Lit: woe
*[g]utterly dominated and disrespected…Lit: trampled underfoot. A NT expression.
*[h]timeframe…Lit: season
*[i]run its course…Also: completed; fulfilled
*[j]the laws of physics that govern the sky above and the universe beyond will be perturbed…Lit: the 
powers of the heavens will be shaken. Some liberties taken.
*[k]Man…Lit: Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[l]your having things restored for you and your having things put back to the way they’re supposed to be 
for you is just around the corner…Lit: your redemption draws near
*[m]generation…This word is taken literally in this context, but on the other hand, perhaps instead it could 
mean a collection of people of the same mindset or an era of thought in the history of mankind.
*[n]grow old and fade out of existence…grow old and fade into irrelevance…Lit: pass by. A NT expression.
*[o]come all of a sudden and relentlessly oppress you…Lit: stand upon you. The word upon used here in 
v.34 and also in v.35 has the same meaning as the way it’s used in nation upon nation, kingdom upon 
kingdom (v. 10, lit.), which talks about one group attacking another in some way or fashion.
*[p]everywhere all over the planet, those simply relaxing and keeping to themselves…Lit: sitting upon the 
face of the entire earth. The face of the earth is an idiom used in the OT, Gen. 7:23 for example.
*[q]in all the various circumstances of life and in the change in current events…Lit: in all seasons

*[A]two dollars…Lit: two leptons. A lepton was the smallest denomination of Greek coin, and is 
traditionally 1/100 of a drachma, and a drachma is roughly equal to a denarius (ref. note of Matt. 18:28 
for denarius conversions).
*[B]claiming to have my authority…Lit: upon my name. Note that it is upon my name rather than in my 
name, which is used in Mark 16:17 and elsewhere. Upon has connotations of forcefully taking something 
that belongs to another, as used in v. 10, lit: nation shall be risen up upon nation. Also, ref. notes of 
Mark 13:6, Matt. 24:4.
*[C]famines & plagues…The two Gk. words used for famine and plague in the phrase limoy kai loimoy 
(λιμοὶ καὶ λοιμοὶ) are the words limos (λιμός /Strong’s 3042) and loimos (λοιμός /Strong’s 3061) form an 
alliteration/assonance, giving credence to the notion that this is an expression and as such is a 
generalization for all sorts of calamities, not confined to the literal meaning “famine and plague.”
*[D]a clamor of the waves and the sea…In the Bible (for example, Rev. 13:1), the sea represents the 
masses of mankind; random people throughout the globe.
[E]pull yourselves together and lift your spirits…Lit: straighten up and lift up your heads. Straighten up 
implies straightening up after a fight. Lift up your heads means to perk up, become optimistic, see the 
opportunities around you, no longer be downcast, shed your self-abasement.

Luke

38|And all the 
folk were getting up early each morning to listen to him in the temple.


&LUKE 22
1|Now the festival of unleavened bread known as the Passover was coming 
up. 
2|The chief priests and the designated teachers[a] were looking for a way to 
eliminate him; the fact of the matter was that they were engrossed with a fear of the 
folk-people. 
3|Satan had entered Judas (called Judas Iscariot), included in the twelve, 

4|and he went out and discussed with the chief priests and the captains of the temple 
guard how he’d go about betraying Jesus and delivering him into their custody. 

5|They were thrilled, and they agreed on the amount of money to pay him. 
6|He 
heartily gave his spoken consent and began seeking an opportune moment when the 
crowd wasn’t around to betray him, to get him into their custody.
          
7|Now the Day of Unleavened Bread arrived, the day during which the 
Passover sacrificial lamb had to be slaughtered. 
8|He sent for Peter and John to tell 
them, “Go make the necessary preparations for the Passover, so that we can partake of 
the sacred meal.” 
9|So they said to him, “Where do you want to have the preparations 
made?” 
10|He told them, “Pay attention now: when you enter the city, a person 
carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house which he intends to 
enters. 
11|You’ll then tell the person who’s responsible for running the household 
which he’s going to enter, ‘The Teacher says, “Where’s the dining hall where I’m to 
partake of the Passover meal with my disciples?”’ 
12|That fellow will show you a 
large upper room that already has seating arrangements spread out: make the preparations 
at that location.” 
13|They went forth and found things just like he had told them it 
would be and made the Passover preparations.
          
14|When the hour for the meal came around, he sat down at the table[b], he and 
the missionaries[c] together with him. 
15|He told them, “With the longings of eager 
desire, I eagerly desire[A] to partake of this Passover meal together with you before I 
undergo this ordeal of suffering. 
16|In light of this, let me tell you…there’s no way 
whatsoever that I’ll partake of this same thing again until such a time that the affairs 
with God’s plan for His involvement with mankind (God’s kingdom) come to maturity 
and are fulfilled.”
          
17|Having taken a cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and distribute it 
amongst yourselves. 
18|In this regard, I’m telling you that there’s no way at all that 
I’ll drink from what the vineyard yields until God’s plan for His involvement with 
mankind (God’s kingdom) does in fact come.” 
19|And having taken a loaf of 
bread, he gave thanks, ceremoniously broke it[d], and gave it to them, saying, “This is my 
body, given on your behalf. Do this to refresh the remembrance of me.” 
20|And he 
took the cup in like manner as the bread served at dinner, saying, “This cup, the new 
covenant in my blood, what’s poured out on behalf of you all— 
21|take a look, 
though: the hand of my betrayer, the one who’s handing me over—with me at this 
table. 
22|Sure, the Man[e] goes down a predetermined road, according to the way 
the road’s been marked off for him[f]; however, bad news for that man through whom 
he’s betrayed and gets arrested.” 
23|They, for their part, started discussing 
amongst themselves who then among them could be the one who intended to 
perpetrate this.
          
24|There happened to also be a friendly dispute among them, namely the 
question of which of them he considers to be the greatest. 
25|He said, “The Gentile 
kings rule over them (the Gentiles), and the select-ones whom those kings appoint to 
positions of authority benefit from such appointments. 
26|But you though—it 
won’t be this way with you. Instead, let the great-one among you become the most 
junior ranking, and let the one who rules become like the one who serves. 
27|So 
now, who’s greater, the one who’s sitting at the dining table[g] or the one doing the 
serving? But for my part, when I hang around you, I’m like the one doing the serving. 

28|You, for your part, have hung in there with me throughout my trials and 
temptations. 
29|And I personally make a covenant with you even as my Father has 
bestowed a kingdom on me by means of a covenant, 
30|so that you would feast 
and live it up[h] at my table in my kingdom, and would sit upon thrones judging all the 
ancient districts[i] of Israel.”
          
31|”Simon, Simon, see here: Satan has sought after you all to sift you like the 
wheat gets sifted; 
32|but I personally prayed for you in order that your faith won’t 
fail and be abandoned. When you get it together and correct your mistake, strengthen 
your comrades.” 
33|He said to him, “Lord, as far as I’m concerned, I’m prepared to 
go with you to prison and to my death.” 
34|But he said, “I’m telling you, Peter, a 
rooster won’t crow today until it’s apparent that you’ve denied me three times.”
          
35|And he said to them, “When I sent you out without cash, a travel pack, 
and sandals, were you ever in need of anything?” They said, “No.” 
36|He said, 
“But now, he who has cash, have him get rid of it; same for the travel pack. And he who 
doesn’t own a sword, have him sell his jacket and have him buy a sword. 
37|Here’s 
what I’m telling you: this verse of Scripture must be fulfilled with respect to me: ‘And 
he was considered to be a criminal like all the other criminals[j].’ It’s the end-game, the 
moment of reckoning, for this verse about me.” 
38|But they said, “Lord, take a look, 
there’s two swords right here.” He said, “Just forget it, Ok[B]?”
          
39|According to habit, he departed and went to the Mount of Olives. His 
disciples followed him there also. 
40|After arriving at that spot, he said to them, 
“Pray not to enter into[k] and succumb to trial and temptation, and pray some more.” 

41|He, though, withdrew about a stone’s-throw away from them, planted his 
knees, and proceeded to pray, 
42|saying, “Father, if You purpose so, take this 
ordeal[l] away from me. However, don’t have my will come to pass but have Yours 
instead.”
          
43|Now an angel was seen strengthening him.[C] 
44|And while he was 
in prayer pushing himself more and more to the limit in the suspense of the impending 
ordeal, his sweat happened to drip on the ground like when drops of blood from a cut drip 
on the ground[D]. 
45|He got up from the prayer and went towards the disciples and 
found them sleeping from the pain, grief, and sorrow. 
46|He said to them, “Why 
are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying, so that you won’t succumb to trial and 
temptation.”
          
47|While he was in the middle of talking, just like that a crowd appeared, 
and the one named Judas—one of the Twelve—was out in front of them and got close to 
Jesus to kiss him. 
48|Jesus said, “Judas, it’s with a kiss that you betray the Man and 
have him taken into custody?” 
49|Seeing what was about to happen, those 
surrounding him said, “Let’s strike with a sword, shall we Lord?[m]”— 
50|And one 
of them struck the high priest’s servant and severed his right ear. 
51|In response 
Jesus said, “Enough—leave ‘em alone[n],” and he touched his ear and healed him. 

52|Jesus said to those who appeared by him, chief priests, temple guard, and 
councilmen[o], “You ventured out with swords and clubs like you were jumping a thug, 
now didn’t you? 
53|Day after day I was with you in the temple you didn’t lay a 
single hand on me. Instead, this very time of the day is your preferred time of day, and 
not only yours but the one in authority over the Darkness.”
          
54|They arrested him, led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s 
domicile; Peter followed at a distance. 
55|A fire had been lit in the middle of the 
courtyard and seats were gathered around it; Peter proceeded to sit among them. 

56|Some teenage servant girl saw him sitting in the light, stared at him, and said,
      “This guys was with him too.”
          
57|He denied it saying, “I don’t know him, lady.”
          
58|A little while later, another person saw him and said, “You’re one of 
them too.”
      But Peter said, “No I’m not, mister.”
          
59|About an hour later someone else insisted, saying, “Seriously—this guy 
was with him too; fact is, he’s also a Galilean.”
          
60|Peter said, “Mister, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
      Immediately, while he was still in the middle of saying this, a rooster crowed. 

61|The Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter recalled the Lord’s statement 
just like he spoke it to him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three 
times.” 
62|He left and went outside and wept bitterly.
          
63|The men who were holding him began to make fun of him; while beating 
him 
64|blindfolded, they asked him, “Prophesy—who hit you?” 
65|And they 
went on and on insulting him.
          
66|And as dawn came, the councilmen, and in addition the high priests and 
designated teachers, were convened in their council known as the Sanhedrin, 

67|saying, “Tell us if you’re the Messiah, the Christ.” He said, “If I were to tell you, 
there’s no way you’d believe me, 
68|and if I were to ask, you certainly wouldn’t 
reply. 
69|From now on the Man will be assuming the position of God’s powerful 
chief executive[p].” 
70|They all said, “Well then, are you the Son of God?”, so he 
said to them, “You yourselves say that I am.”

*[p]the Man will be assuming the position of God’s powerful chief executive…Lit: will be the Son of Man 
sitting at the right hand of power of God. The phrase sitting at the right hand of power is worded as a 
figure of speech.
 
*[A]With the longings of eager desire, I eagerly desire…Lit: (in Gk.) epithumia epethumasa 
(Ἐπιθυμίᾳ ἐπεθύμησα), (Ἐπιθυμίᾳ /Strong’s 1939), (ἐπεθύμησα/Strong’s 1937). This redundant use of 
the same word, howbeit in noun and participle forms, is likely an expression, and if not an expression, 
would be a figure of speech (alliteration/assonance).
*[B]just forget it, ok…Also: enough on this topic…Or: That’ll work…Lit: it is enough. Some ambiguity, as 
Jesus could be taken to mean “enough of this nonsense” or “that’ll be enough swords.” The former is 
assumed to be correct, as it is connected to what Jesus said in v. 36: “have him sell his jacket [lit: cloak] 
and have him buy a sword.” What Jesus meant by this statement of v. 36 is that you’ll no longer need 
your cloak. Everyone owned a cloak, and most people owned just one, and it was used as a blanket at 
night—which would be your only blanket too. In the long-term, a cloak was an essential need of life, but 
in the short-term is not a necessity, like when one is engaged in moderate physical activity, since the 
body generates enough heat to keep oneself warm without needing a cloak for warmth. The cloak 
becomes necessary after the activity, of course. The sword refers to going to a war. Together, what v. 36 
means is for you to get rid of your cloak since you won’t be needing it anymore, but acquire a sword in 
its place, since you will be needing that: You’re going to war and you’ll probably be killed. Jesus didn’t 
literally mean to buy a sword and go off to battle; his meaning was figurative. But the twelve didn’t see 
it as figurative, taking the statement literally. Jesus didn’t have enough time to explain himself, so he 
simply dropped the subject by saying “just forget it, ok.”
*[C]Verses 43 and 44 are not found in some of the most important manuscripts (KJV: “43And there 
appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44And being in an agony he prayed more 
earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”)This passage 
has always been controversial, and that because of its content. Verse 43 has the same spurious feel to it 
as John 5:4, and verse 44 has been debated for centuries (see next note).
*[D]his sweat happened to drip on the ground like when drops of blood from a cut drip on the 
ground…Jesus didn’t actually sweat drops of blood; this is a simile. The rate at which his drops of sweat 
dripped onto the ground is compared to the rate at which, say for example, you cut your finger with a 
knife—the rate at which that cut bleeds. That’s a high rate of perspiration, one which occurs when a 
person is engaged in highly strenuous exercise, usually complicated by warmer temperatures. The fact 
that Jesus wasn’t physically moving and that it was chilly enough later in the night for Peter to have to 
warm himself around a fire makes this extraordinary. On the other hand, there’s dubious (at best) 
scientific evidence to back up the claim that people under extreme duress sweat blood. It simply does 
not happen. So if Jesus did actually sweat drops of blood, as many assert, that removes that experience 
of prayer out of the realm of human experience and into the super-human, even supernatural, and in 
this instance would have exempted him from suffering as an ordinary human being.

&LUKE 23
1|The entire group of them got up and brought him to Pilate. 
2|They 
proceeded to make accusations against him, saying, “We found this guy corrupting our 
culture, preventing people from paying Caesar taxes, and saying that he himself is a 
Messiah-king[a].” 
3|So Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of Jews?”, but he 
answered, “Whatever you say[b].” 
4|Pilate said to the chief priests and to the throng, “I 
haven’t found anything to charge this man with,” 
5|but they kept on saying more and 
more strenuously and assertively, “He incites the folk-people by teaching and 
instructing them throughout the whole district of Judea. He started this in Galilee and 
worked his way from there all the way down to here.”
          
6|After Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean. 
7|Once he 
realized that he falls under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was 
also in Jerusalem during these festival days. 
8|Seeing Jesus, Herod was especially 
delighted, since for quite a long time he’d been dying to see him owing to hearing about 
him time and time again, and with glee was hoping to see him cause some supernatural 
sign or miracle to happen. 
9|In a good deal of remarks and statements, he asked him 
several things, but he wouldn’t reply. 
10|The chief priests and the designated 
teachers[c] were standing there vehemently accusing him. 
11|Herod and his soldiers 
together treated him with contempt, mocked him by dressing him in bright, colorful, 
beautiful clothing[A], and sent him back to Pilate. 
12|That very day a friendship 
formed between Herod and Pilate; hitherto they had been hostile towards each other.
          
13|Now Pilate summoned the chief priests, leaders, and the folk-people. 

14|He said to them, “You brought me this man who supposedly subverts the folk, 
and—as you can see—I personally examined him in front of you all and found nothing 
to charge him with, 
15|and—no—neither did Herod, seeing that he sent him back 
to us. And—as you can see—nothing worthy of death has been committed by him. 

16|So now, I’ll teach him a lesson by flogging him and then I’ll set him free.” 

17|[B]
          
18|They shouted back in unison, “Get rid of this guy and let Barabbas go for 
us.” 
19|(This was the very person who was thrown in prison for murderer because 
of some insurrection which occurred in the city.)
          
20|Again, Pilate addressed them, “Are you wanting to let Jesus go?”,
          
21|but they kept on shouting telling him, “Crucify him and crucify him some 
more[d]!”
          
22|The third time he said to them, “Why? What has this guy done wrong? 
I’ve found nothing to charge him with which warrants the death penalty. I’ll teach him 
a lesson by flogging him and then I’ll set him free.”
          
23|But they kept on piling on in loud voices demanding that he be crucified, 
and their shouts were overwhelming; 
24|Pilate decided to acquiesce to their 
request. 
25|He freed the one thrown in prison due to an insurrection, the one they 
kept asking for, but he delivered Jesus over to their will and desire.
          
26|As they were leading him away, they pressed into service one Simon of 
Cyrene, who was coming home from work, and put the cross on him to carry behind 
Jesus. 
27|A large crowd of the folk people followed him, and women who 
continuously thumped their chests and wept and wailed and sang dirges. 
28|Jesus 
turned to them and said, “Dear ladies[e], don’t cry for me. Do, however, cry for 
yourselves and for your children, 
29|because—just like that—days will come in 
which they’ll say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the pregnant who never carried a child to 
term, the breasts that never breast-fed.’ 
30|Then they’ll commence going about…

”…Saying to the mountains,
‘Fall on us’
And to the hills,
‘Hide us’.


31|”If they’re doing these things with pieces of freshly-cut lumber, then whatever 
happened to the dried-out pieces?[C]”
          
32|Now he and two other criminals along with him were being led in a 
spectacle of a procession to be hoisted up on crosses and crucified. 
33|When they came 
to the place called The Skull, there he and the criminals were crucified, one to the right 
and the other to the left. 
34|Jesus proceeded to say, “Father, forgive them, since 
they don’t know what they’re doing.”[f] To divide his clothing up amongst themselves, 
they rolled dice[g]. 
35|The folk-people stood around watching. The rulers also began 
ridiculing him, saying, “He rescued others; if this guy is God’s Messiah, His Christ—the 
Chosen One, let him rescue himself.” 
36|The soldiers also made fun of him by 
going up to him, bringing him spoiled-wine vinegar, 
37|and saying, “If you’re the 
king of the Jews, rescue yourself.” 
38|There was also a sign on top of him: “This 
guy is the king of the Jews.”
          
39|One of the criminals hung on a cross with him kept on insulting him 
saying, “Aren’t you the Messiah, the Christ? Rescue yourself and us as well.” 

40|But the other responded, scolding him, “Don’t you fear God even one bit 
because you’re facing the same sentence? 
41|Sure, we’re being treated justly; 
indeed we deserve what’s been meted out to us. But this guy did nothing egregious.” 

42|He said, “Jesus, remember me when you assume your preordained position in 
your kingdom[h].” 
43|And he said to him, “Mark my words, you’ll be with me in 
Paradise today.”
          
44|Around the time it reached noon[i], darkness appeared over the entire 
land and persisted until three in the afternoon[i], 
45|while the sun was obscured. 
The temple curtain was torn in two down the middle. 
46|Calling out in a loud 
voice, Jesus said, “Father, into Your hands I entrust my spirit.” 
47|Upon seeing 
what had happened, the centurion glorified God saying, “This man really was 
righteous.” 
48|And everyone in the crowd of bystanders, having witnessed what 
had happened, thumped their chests and began to leave. 
49|Everyone who knew 
him was standing at a distance to view these things, including the women from Galilee 
who too accompanied him as his followers.
          
50|As events unfolded a man named Joseph, he being a councilman, and a 
good and righteous man 
51|(this fellow was not in agreement with the council and 
did not consent with what they did), from Arimathea, a city in Judea, one who was 
embracing God’s invitation for Him to be involved in his life (was receiving God’s 
kingdom)— 
52|This fellow approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. 

53|He pulled him down, wrapped him in fine linen, and put him in a tomb hewn 
from rock, in which nobody had yet been laid to rest.
          
54|It was a preparation day, preparation for the Sabbath which would start the 
following day, and the sun was about to set and consequently begin the next day, the 
Sabbath[D]. 
55|The women, those who had come down with him from Galilee, 
trailed behind following those who buried him, saw the tomb and how his body was 
placed, 
*[a]a Messiah-king…Lit: Christ king
*[b]Whatever you say…Lit: You’re saying [it]; or possibly: You said it, not me
*[c]designated teachers…Lit: scribes
*[d]Crucify him and crucify him some more…Lit: crucify crucify him. Appears to be an expression.
*[e]Dear ladies…Lit: Daughters of Jerusalem. More precisely, it means the society women of Israel’s 
leading metropolis, Jerusalem, as for example used in Song of Solomon 1:5.
*[f]Jesus proceeded to say, “Father, forgive them, since they don’t know what they’re doing.”…The 
principal manuscripts are divided as to whether this sentence is spurious or not.
*[g]rolled dice…Lit: cast lots. Some liberties taken.
*[h]assume your preordained position in your kingdom…Lit: come into your kingdom
*[i]noon…three in the afternoon…Lit: the sixth hour…the ninth hour

*[A]bright, colorful, beautiful clothing…In ancient times, kings, noblemen, and the rich were distinguished 
from the peasants by wearing this sort of clothing; hence Herod’s mocking of Jesus’s kingship.
*[B]Verse 17 omitted by the better manuscripts
*[C]If they’re doing these things with pieces of freshly-cut lumber, then whatever happened to the dried-
out pieces?…The lumber Jesus is referring to is the lumber used to make a cross. The answer to Jesus’s 
question, what happened to the dried-out pieces, is that the dried-out pieces are already in use with 
bodies still hung on them being crucified. As a result, there are no more pieces of wood lying around 
which can be used to crucify everyone who’s about to be crucified. The Romans crucified criminals on a 
regular basis, and undoubtedly reused the same crosses over and over, keeping them in a back room or 
a warehouse, as this would be easier than finding wood and building a cross each time a criminal 
needed to be crucified. So they kept enough crosses in storage to handle the day-to-day crucifixions, 
and these crosses are the “dried-out pieces” referred to in this verse. However, there were instances 
when the Romans performed mass-crucifixions, and the fall of Jerusalem in 70AD would be one such 
instance. In that case, they wouldn’t have been enough crosses in storage to perform all the crucifixions, 
as the roads would be lined for miles with those crucified. In that case, they’d have to cut down trees to 
get the lumber needed for all the crucifixions, hence the “pieces of freshly-cut lumber.”
*[D]It was a preparation day, preparation for the Sabbath which would start the following day, and the sun 
was about to set and consequently begin the next day, the Sabbath…Lit: It was a preparation day, and it 
was [starting to] dawning a Sabbath. Though the Gk. word for dawn is used in the verse, scholars agree 
that this is referring to the beginning of a new day, which for the Jews is evening, not morning, and not 
sunrise per se. Some liberties taken with the wording to make this clearer to the reader.

1|…[A]Nevertheless, they got up early on Sunday, the first day of the week[B], 
while it was still quite dark, and went to the tomb bringing the fragrance they had 
prepared. 
2|They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb, 
3|but 
after entering didn’t find the Lord Jesus’s body. 
4|While the women were in a state of 
perplexity over this, out of nowhere two men in gleaming clothing unexpectedly and 
abruptly showed up standing right next to them[a], 
5|and they became terrified of 
them. Turning their faces to the ground, they said to them, “Why are you looking for 
the Living One among the dead? 
6|He’s not here; he’s been resurrected instead. 
Remember how he spoke to you while you were still in Galilee, 
7|saying that the 
Man[b] must be betrayed and taken into custody by the hands of sinners, crucified, and 
resurrected on the third day.”
          
8|They remembered his remarks, 
9|returned from the tomb, and announced 
all these things to the eleven and to everyone else. 
10|Now Mary Magdalene, 
Joanna, and James’s mother Mary were there at the tomb. The other women who were 
associated with them proceeded to tell these things to the missionaries[c]. 
11|The 
impression that they took away from their presentation was that their remarks were just 
a lot of gibberish, and they refused to believe them. 
12|But Peter got up and ran to 
the tomb, stooped and sees nothing but the linens only, and left from there wondering to 
himself what had happened.
          
13|As events unfolded, on that very same day two of them were walking 
into a town, they being about seven miles/eleven kilometers[C] from Jerusalem, in a town 
named Emmaus. 
14|They were conversing with one another about how all of these 
things had transpired[d]. 
15|It came to pass while they were conversing, making 
points and counterpoints, that Jesus himself approached them and walked together 
with them. 
16|But their eyes were being held shut from recognizing him[e]. 

17|He said to them,
      “What’s up with these thoughts that you’ve bounced off each other while 
walking?”
      They stood still and looked depressed. 
18|The one named Cleopas replied, 
“Are you the only one in Jerusalem who’s totally clueless[f] and doesn’t know what’s 
happened these last few days?”
          
19|He said, “Like what[g]?”
      They said, “Those things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who became a 
mighty prophet in deed and in speech as considered by[h] God and by all the folk-
people; 
20|furthermore, how our chief priests and rulers arrested him with the goal 
of sentencing him to death, and they crucified him. 
21|We kept on hoping that he’s 
the one who’s going to do what it takes to liberate Israel; meanwhile, three days have 
gone by since these things happened and that hasn’t been the case. 
22|But on top of 
that, some of the women who hang around us but had gone on an excursion caused us 
to lose our minds: they were terrified when they were at the tomb 
23|and didn’t 
find his body there, and after returning they said that they even saw angels who 
appeared to them in visible form and the angels say that he’s alive. 
24|And certain 
members of our group left for the tomb and found things to be this way, just like the 
women told us, but didn’t see him.” 
25|And he said to them, “Oh, witless and slow 
in heart in believing in everything which the prophets have said. 
26|Didn’t the 
Messiah, the Christ, have to suffer these things and then enter into his glory?” 

27|And having begun from the beginning of the Old Testament and walking 
through it[i], he proceeded to interpret for them all those references in the Scriptures 
about him.
          
28|They got near to the town which they were going to, and he acted as if he 
was going to continue walking further. 
29|They urged him, “Stay with us, since 
evening’s approaching and the day’s already come to a close.” He entered the house they 
arrived at as though he was going to stay with them. 
30|As a matter of course, while 
he was relaxed at the dinner table, he took the bread, gave thanks, broke it[j], and gave it 
to them. 
31|Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, but he left and 
didn’t come back[k]. 
32|They said to each other, “Weren’t our hearts burning within 
us as he was speaking to us on the way here, as he kept on unfolding the meaning of the 
Scriptures?” 
33|And they got up that very moment and returned to Jerusalem and 
found the eleven gathered together, they and those associated with them, 

34|saying that the Lord really had come back from the dead[l] and was seen by 
Simon. 
35|They explained what happened on the road and how he came to be 
recognized by them in the breaking of bread[j].
          
36|While they were still speaking these words, he stood among them and 
then says to them, “Peace be with you[m].” 
37|They were startled and became 
frightened and thought they were looking at a ghost. 
38|He said, “Why have you 
become troubled, and what’s the reason these erroneous contemplations and conclusions 
you’ve drawn percolate up from the base things of this earth and[D] into your collective 
heart? 
39|Take a look at my hands and feet, that I am he. Touch me and see that a 
ghost doesn’t have flesh and bone in the same way that you see me having.” 

40|After he said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
41|Out of the joy, 
wonder, and marvel of it all, they just couldn’t believe it[E], so he said to them, “Do you 
have anything to eat here?” 
42|They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
43|and 
he took it and ate it right in front of them.
          
44|He said to them, “I spoke to you those very words of mine while I was 
still with you because all the verses in the Old Testament[n] about me had to be 
fulfilled.” 
45|Then he opened their minds for them to understand the Scriptures. 

46|He said, “…Things turned out this way because the suffering of the Messiah, the 
Christ, and his resurrection from the dead on the third day had been captured in 
writing like that in the Old Testament, 
47|and things turned out this way for you to be 
authorized and commissioned by him to preach and proclaim to all nations a change in 
heart and in conduct leading to a forgiveness of sins[o], initiated from Jerusalem: 

48|You all will testify about[p] these things. 
49|And—get a load of this—I’m 
sending the promise of my Father to come upon you; but sit tight in the city until that 
time when you be clothed from on high in supernatural power.”
          
50|He took them all the way out to Bethany and lifted up his hands and 
blessed them. 
51|It so happened while he was blessing them that he parted from 
them and was carried up into the sky, into heaven. 
52|They worshipped him and 
returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 
*[a]unexpectedly and abruptly showed up standing right next to them…Lit: stood upon them with them
*[b]the Man…Lit: Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.

with an hyperbole.

plural form Sabbaths does not prove that in and of itself. Ref. note of Matt. 28:1.
*[C]seven miles/eleven kilometers…Lit: 60 stadia (plural of stadion). 1 stadion = 184 meters.
*[D]percolate up from the base things of this earth and…Lit: go up or ascend. Unusual to find the wording 
go up rather than enter in; it’s inferred that these things came up from the ground, and the ground is 
where base, negative, carnal, and evil things of life originate, as insinuated in other parts of the Bible.
[E]Out of the joy, wonder, and marvel of it all, they just couldn’t believe it…This is partly true in a literal 
sense and partly a figure of speech (ref. Matt. 28:17 for a parallel figure of speech). They believed him 
but were too stunned to believe him entirely, so he supplied more evidence for their physical senses.


The Gospel of John
       John’s Gospel stands apart from the other three—Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Synoptic 
Gospels—in more ways than one. It’s content is different, it’s chronology is different. The Greek that 
John uses is very simple and is, for the most part, readily translated word-for-word into English. 
However, underneath the simplistic wording is an enigmatic book which makes vague, abstract 
generalizations it does not explain. John’s epistles are even more simplistic yet enigmatic and vague.
       On the one hand, John’s writing needs a good copy editing. Among other things, he uses the 
wrong verb tenses, is too ambiguous, assuming that the reader will have no problem filling in the 
missing content. Had I submitted something comparable to the way that John writes as a high school 
term paper, my English teachers would’ve marked it all up in red.
       On the other hand, John has his own peculiar meaning of words and phrases that differ from 
everything else in the NT and which can only be learned by studying his writings, the simple, vague 
phrases which are enigmatic and profound. In fact, from a language perspective, John’s Gospel should 
be viewed in a separate light from the remainder of the NT, so different is his writing. Inside this simple 
fisherman was a deeply spiritual man, one who was Semitic and not Western, one who used words and 
grammatical constructs his own ways and not the way everyone else does.
       Of all the books in the NT, John’s Gospel has enjoyed preeminence from the days of the early 
church. This is proven by the fact that the oldest surviving manuscripts NT manuscripts, and the most 
numerous of the oldest, are of John. And if Matthew was written to Jews, Mark to Romans, Luke to 
Greeks, then John was written to Christians.

throughout it all.


&JOHN 1
1|In the beginning[A] was the Concept[B], and the Concept was with God, and 
the Concept was God, having His very nature. 
2|This person was in the beginning with 
God. 
3|Through him all things came into being, and nothing which has come into 
being came into being apart from him. 
4|In him was life, and the Life was the light of 
mankind. 
5|And in the midst of it all the Light shined[C] in the Darkness, and the 
Darkness couldn’t take it down, overpower it, or contain it[a].
          
6|A man sent from God appeared on the scene, and his name was John. 

7|This fellow came to give an official account[b], so that he would give an account 
concerning the Light, so that all would believe through him. 
8|That fellow was not the 
Light—instead, he came in order that he would testify about the Light: 
9|It[c] was the 
True Light, that which shines to all mankind, while coming into the world, the 
established order of humans. 
10|He was in and among the world and the world 
came into being through him, but the world didn’t know[d] him. 
11|He went to his 
own particular group of people, and his own didn’t whole-heartedly welcome and 
embrace him[e]. 
12|But to whomever whole-heartedly welcomed and embraced 
him, it was to them he gave the authorization and power to become children of God, to 
those who believe and have faith in his established authority[f], 
13|to those who 
were begotten neither out of spillings of blood[g] nor out of a best-effort of self nor out of 
carnal desire[h] nor out of the will of a man, but instead were begotten from God.
          
14|And the Concept became flesh and set up camp[D] among us. We beheld 
his glory, glory as that of an only-begotten issued from the Father, full of grace and 
truth. 
15|John testified about him, having cried out, “This fellow here is the one I 
referred to when I said, ‘The one who comes after me has been the center of my 
attention[i], because he was (and is) superior to me.’”
          
16|When you get to the bottom of it all, all of us have received of his 
fullness, and grace piled on top of grace[j]. 
17|When you get to the bottom of it all, 
the Old Testament Law was given through Moses; the grace and the truth which we’re 
talking about came into being through Jesus Christ. 
18|Nobody has seen God fully; 
God’s only-begotten, who’s in tight with the Father[E]—that’s the person who brought 
him out of obscurity.”
        
19|John’s testimony
      When the Judean Jews[F] sent priests and clergymen[k] from Jerusalem to him in 
order to ask, “Who are you?”, 
20|he gave them a straight-up answer saying 
forthrightly[l], “Me?—No, I’m not the Messiah[m].” 
21|They asked him, 
      “Just who are you? Are you Elijah?”
      Jumping right in, he said, “No, I’m not.”
      “Are you the Prophet?”
      He answered, “No.”
          
22|So they said to him, “Who are you then?—Tell us so we can give a reply 
to those who sent us. Who do you claim to be[n]?”
          
23|He said, “I’m a…

“…Voice shouting out in the countryside[o]
Barricade the road the Lord will take!

“…as written by the Prophet Isaiah.”
          
24|Now the ones who had been sent were sent by the Pharisees. 

25|They posed a question asking, “So now, why do you perform baptisms if you’re 
neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor the Prophet?” 
26|John replied by saying, “My role 
is to baptize in water. But someone has taken a stand in your midst, someone whom 
you have no first-hand knowledge of, 
27|someone who follows in my footsteps, 
someone whom I’m not even worthy of unfastening his sandal strap.” 
28|These 
things took place in Bethany alongside the Jordan River, the place where John was 
baptizing.
          
29|The next day he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, “Look here—
God’s lamb who takes away the world’s sin. 
30|This is the person whom I referred 
to when I said, ‘A man’s coming who’ll follow in my footsteps, a man who has become 
the center of my attention because he is superior to me because he was in existence 
before I was.’ 
31|I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, he 
was not known even to me in order he would become known to Israel all at once. This is the 
reason my role was to come baptizing in water.” 
32|And John solemnly declared in 
a statement for the record that he had beheld the Spirit coming down out of the sky like 
a dove and remaining upon him from then on: 
33|”I had no personal first-hand 
knowledge of him; on the contrary, the One who sent me to baptize in water, He’s the 
One who said to me, ‘Upon whom you happen to behold the Spirit coming down and 
remaining upon, that’s the person who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ 
34|And I have 
beheld this event personally and have solemnly attested that this person is the Son of 
God.”
          
35|Again, the next day John was just standing there, he and two of his 
disciples, 
36|and saw Jesus going here and there, and interjected, “Look here—
God’s lamb.” 
37|His two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus, in order 
to become his disciples. 
38|Jesus turned and saw them following him and, prompting 
them, said, “What can I do for you[p]?” So they said to him, “Rabbi (which is translated 
‘Teacher’), where are you staying?” 
39|Keeping their curiosity, he said, “Come and 
see.” So they went and saw where he was staying and remained in his company[q] that 
day; it was late afternoon around four. 
40|One of the two who used to be John’s 
disciples who heard and became his, Jesus’s, disciple was Simon Peter’s brother 
Andrew. 
41|First thing he did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “I’ve 
found the Messiah” (which translated means ‘Christ’). 
42|He led him to Jesus. 
Jesus saw him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You’ll be called ‘Cephas’” (which 
translated means ‘Peter’).
          
43|He wanted to depart for Galilee the next day, and he winds up finding 
Phillip. Jumping right in, Jesus said to him, “Be my follower.” 
44|Now Philip was 
from Bethsaida, the same city that Andrew and Peter were from. 
45|Philip tracked 
down Nathanael and, figuring he’d get a reply, said to him,
      “We found the person spoken of in the writings of the Old Testament[r], Jesus of 
Nazareth son of Joseph.”
          
46|Nathanael said, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”
      Philip said to him, “Come take a look.”
          
47|Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him and said about him, “Check it 
out—a genuine, down-to-earth, native son of Israel in whom there’s no duplicity or 
deceit[s].” 
          
48|Nathanael, starting a conversation, said to him, “Where do you know me 
from?”
      Jesus replied, “While you were under the fig tree before Philip hollered for you, I 
saw you.”
          
49|Nathanael replied, “Teacher, you’re the Son of God, you’re king over 
Israel.” 
          
50|Jesus formulated a reply, “You believe because I said to you that I saw 
you under the fig tree? You’ll see greater things than this.” 
*[a]take it down, overpower it, or contain it…Also: suppress it (NASB); hold it down. Same word used with 
the same meaning in John 12:35; 1 Thess. 5:4.
*[b]came to give an official account…Lit: came as a witness
*[c]It…Or: He. The GT is ambiguous here and must be decided by the context; since this is the antecedent 
of the Light, light, since it is a concept, has a gender which is neuter.
*[d]know…Also: understand, comprehend, recognize
*[e]whole-heartedly welcome and embrace him…Lit: receive alongside
*[f]in his established authority…Lit: in his name
*[g]out of spillings of blood…Lit: from bloods. Note the plural bloods.
*[h]out of a best-effort of self nor out of carnal desire…Lit: from flesh
*[i]has been the center of my attention…Lit: before me. Common phrase throughout the Bible.
*[j]grace piled on top of grace…Lit: grace in place of grace. As if the subsequent grace replaces the 
previous grace.
*[k]clergymen…Lit: Levites. Some liberties taken.
*[l]He gave them a straight-up answer saying forthrightly…Lit: He confessed and didn’t deny and confessed 
that. A figure of speech.
*[m]the Messiah…Lit: the Christ
*[n]Who do you claim to be?…Lit: What do you say about yourself?
*[o]countryside…Lit: wilderness
*[p]What can I do for you?…Lit: What are you looking for?
*[q]in his company…Lit: alongside
*[r]spoken of in the writings of the Old Testament…Lit: Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote about
*[s]duplicity or deceit…Lit: the Gk. word dolos (δόλος /Strong’s 1388). Dolos originally meant “the bait 
used for fish.”
*[t]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
 
*[A]In the beginning…Lit (Gk): en archai (Ἐν ἀρχῇ), (Ἐν/Strong’s 1722), (ἀρχῇ/Strong’s 746). Same two-
word introduction as is found in Gen. 1:1 of the Septuagint; this is not a coincidence. The rendering 
therefore the typical English Bible’s Genesis beginning so that the reader would notice the similarity. 
Otherwise, variations in translation could render en archai as “in ancient times” or something like that, 
as the definite article is missing from beginning, which means there’s no specific beginning epoch 
referred to.
*[B]the Concept…Lit: the Word. Concept (short for Conception) taken from H.D.F. Kitto’s book The Greeks: 
“In the works of Man, Reason and Perfection assume a symmetrical form…The Greek for Reason, in the 
present sense, is ‘logos’, from which the adjective ‘logical’. ‘Logos’ is usually mistranslated ‘word’: is 
rather ‘speech’, or, the idea which is conveyed by speech. ‘In the beginning was the Word’ really means 
‘In the beginning was the Conception’…Here is the culmination of the search made by Greek thinkers for 
the inner reality, the ‘logos’; The Word was God.” Also, ref. note of Rom. 10:8.
*[C]in the midst of it all the light shined…Lit: the light shines. The use of the present tense for the past 
tense is a common figure of speech used in the Gospels. Ref. note of Luke 17:37. 
But for this verse, this is a special figure of speech, a subcategory of the usage of present for past, one 
where in two consecutive, related clauses (first clause: the light shines in the Darkness; second clause: 
the Darkness couldn’t take it down), the first clause uses the present tense, but is understood by the 
reader to be the past tense, and the following clause uses the past tense as expected. This same figure 
of speech is used in Rev. 12:4a, Rev. 13:14b. The usage of such a figure of speech begs the question: 
what idea, notion, etc. is the writer communicating beyond the face-value meaning of the words? Some 
guesswork is involved, but it appears that the present tense in the first clause is similar to some of the 
modes of the imperfect tense, where in the imperfect directs the reader to pause and ponder what was 
going on as the event was unfolding. In the present-then-past-tense clauses, the present tense seems to 
emphasize a difficulty of some sort—perhaps even a long, drawn-out ordeal—and the follow-up past 
tense clause states with emphasis the outcome of the difficulty.
*[D]set up camp…Lit: dwelled in a tent or pitched tent. Hearkens back to the days of Abraham and also to 
the sojourning in the wilderness when the people of God lived in tents. As such, it is a Figure of Speech, 
one used here and there in the Bible. Ref. note of Luke 16:9. It also indicates that Jesus was only to take 
on flesh and live among us for a brief period of time, then he would—like a nomad—fold up his tent one 
day, break camp, and go somewhere else.
*[E]in tight with the Father…Lit: being in the bosom of the Father. Same word bosom used for the bosom of 
Abraham; it is the same concept. Ref. note of Luke 16:22.
[F]the Judean Jews…Lit: the Judeans or the Jews. John uses this word several times when he writes. It can 
be translated Jews or Judeans depending on the context. When translated Jews, it refers to Jews in 
general, non-Gentiles. When translated Judeans (ref John 2:18, 3:1 for example), it refers to the Jews 
who live in Judean, as opposed to Jews who live in Galilee, etc. Also by referring to Judeans, the 
implication is that these are the Jews who occupy the positions of power in Israel.

&JOHN 2
1|A wedding occurred on a Tuesday[A] in Cana, Galilee, and Jesus’s mother 
was attending. 
2|Jesus was also invited—and so were his disciples—to the wedding. 

3|Having run out of wine, Jesus’s mother, in the heat of the moment, said to him,
      “They don’t have any wine.”
          
4|Jesus, consumed with the comment, said, “I have no beef with you, lady[B]—
my time has not yet arrived![C]”
          
5|As things were unfolding, his mother said to the waiters, “Do whatever he 
tells you to do.”
          
6|Now according to the Jewish purification restrictions, there were six large 
clay pots lying nearby, with a capacity of up to a keg or a keg and a half apiece[a]. 

7|Jesus, on top of the situation, told them, “Fill the pots with water.” They filled the 
pots all the way up with water. 
8|Continuing his train of thought, he told them, “Now 
draw some water from one of the pots and bring it to the maître ‘d.” So they brought some 
over to him. 
9|As the maître ‘d tasted the water-which-had-become-wine, not knowing 
where it came from (the waiters who had drawn the water knew), the maître ‘d called 
for the groom 
10|and, going over procedures, told him, “Every person sets out the 
good wine first and when everyone eventually becomes tipsy sets out the lower-grade 
stuff. You, though, have withheld the good wine until now.” 
11|This miracle that 
Jesus performed in Cana, Galilee was the first in a long series of miracles signalling that 
he’s from God, and it evinced his glory and made believers out of his disciples.
          
12|After this he went down to Capernaum, he, his mother, his brothers, and 
his disciples, and stayed there for many days.
          
13|The Jewish Passover was coming up, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem. 

14|In the temple he ran across those selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the 
money changers seated at tables, 
15|and he made a whip out of a cord and drove 
them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He swept the money 
changers’ coins off the tables spilling them all over the floor and overturned the tables. 

16|He told the dove sellers, “Get out of here—don’t turn my Father’s house into a 
merchandising outlet!” 
17|His disciples remembered a verse of Scripture that says, 
“The zeal for Your house utterly consumes me.”
          
18|The Judean Jews, putting two plus two together, responded, “What 
spectacular miracle[b] will you demonstrate for us, seeing that you do these things?” 

19|Jesus answered, “Break this temple into pieces and I’ll raise it back up in three 
days.” 
20|Thereupon the Judeans said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple, 
and you’ll erect it in three days?” 
21|But that ol’ boy was by obsession talking about 
the temple of his body. 
22|So now, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples 
remembered what he was saying in that moment of obsession, and they believed the verse 
of Scripture and the remark which Jesus spoke to them.
          
23|As he was in the temple in Jerusalem during the Passover, many believed 
that he had authority bequeathed on him[c], seeing the miracles that he did. 

24|Jesus, however, wasn’t inclined to trust them on account of him having an 
understanding of everything and everyone. 
*[a]up to a keg or a keg and a half apiece…Lit: up to two or three metretes. A metrete is 8.75 gallons (40 
liters); three metretes make 26.25 gallons (120 liters).
*[b]spectacular miracle…Lit: sign
*[c]that he had authority bequeathed on him…Lit: in his name
*[d]spell out plainly and clearly…Lit: testify
*[e]human nature…Lit: the man. The definite article the before man, like the thief in John 10:10, specifies 
an archetype rather than a specific person.

*[A]on a Tuesday…Lit: with the Third Day. John’s use of the attributive form of the adjective in conjunction 
with the definite articles means that he’s referring to something which he’s confident that the reader 
will know about. In fact, the Third Day is a variation of the third of the Sabbaths; ref. notes of Math 28:1, 
Mark 16:2, 1 Cor. 16:2.
*[B]I have no beef with you, lady…Lit: me and you, woman; and expanding the inflections, to me and to 
you, woman (me and you are in the dative case; the addition of the preposition to is necessary when 
rendered to English). Me and you is an expression used in the NT, and appears in Matt. 8:29, Mark 1:24, 
Mark 5:7, Luke 8:28 (and perhaps more). Its meaning is deduced by its usage in these various verses.
[C]I have no beef with you, lady—my time has not yet arrived!…This is the first miracle Jesus ever 
performed (ref. v. 12), and it’s significant that it occurred at a wedding. This wedding has a symbolic 
meaning, and what Jesus says here addresses the symbolism of the event. The wedding symbolizes 
God’s plan for the human race. God intended all of mankind to live life as though it were one long 
wedding celebration of a sort, but then sin entered into the world and spoiled the party. Wine is what 
generates the frivolity and lightens the mood, causing the guests to loosen up and celebrate. Wine 
symbolizes the means by which mankind can enter into life’s celebration. But also, as red wine has a 
color similar to blood, at the same time it’s symbolic of the blood Jesus shed on our behalf. The 
symbolism is this: the party is over until someone supplies the wine (the blood), which brings life back to 
a dead party. When Mary tells Jesus they have no wine, on the symbolic level, she’s telling him to give 
the blood which will restore the human race to its festivities. This is why Jesus replied, my time has not 
yet arrived—the time for him to shed his blood had not yet arrived.

25|He didn’t need anyone to spell out 
plainly and clearly[d] the aspects of human nature[e]; the fact is, he was ever mindful of 
and was forever discerning human nature[e].


&JOHN 3
1|Now there was a man named Nicodemus who was one of the Pharisees and 
was a Jewish ruler. 
2|This fellow went to Jesus one night[a] and said,
      “Rabbi, we know that you’re a teacher sent from God; the fact of the matter is, no 
one can perform the spectacular miracles[b] which you perform, unless God be with 
him.”
          
3|Jesus, getting to the heart of it all, replied, “I’m telling you the honest-to-
goodness truth: if someone’s not born from that spiritual plane where God exists[A], he 
can’t have a first-hand understanding[c] of God’s involvement with mankind (can’t see 
God’s kingdom).”
          
4|On the heels of that, Nicodemus said, “How can a person who’s not a baby[d] 
be born? It’s not possible for him to enter his mother’s womb a second time and be 
born.”
          
5|Jesus replied, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth: if someone’s not 
born of water and spirit[B], God won’t interact with him (he can’t enter God’s kingdom). 

6|Whatever has been birthed out of flesh (i.e., the physical body, man’s attempt to act 
in his own ability apart from God; man’s carnal nature) is flesh (i.e. is physical only; is 
only as good as man’s best-efforts; has a carnality about it), and whatever’s been birthed 
out of spirit is spiritual in nature. 
7|Don’t be taken aback because I told you, ‘You all 
must be born from that spiritual plane where God exists.’ 
8|The wind[C] blows 
wherever it wants, and you hear the sound that it makes, but—no—you don’t know 
where it comes from and where it goes to. It’s the same way for everyone born from the 
Spirit.”
          
9|Nicodemus answered, “How can this happen?”
          
10|Jesus answered, “You, now, are an instructor for the nation of Israel and 
you don’t understand these things? 
11|I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness 
truth: we talk about what we have first-hand knowledge of and we give formal 
accounts[e] about what we’ve beheld, and you all don’t receive our formal accounts. 

12|If I told you about things which are down-to-earth and you won’t believe them, 
how would you believe what I’m saying if I were to speak to you about heavenly things? 

13|No one has ascended to the ultimate spiritual plane of heaven except for the one 
who descended from heaven: namely the Man[f]. 
14|And just as in the wilderness 
Moses lifted up the serpent and held him there, in the same way the Man must be lifted 
up and held there 
15|in order that everyone who believes in him would have that 
special fullness of life (eternal life). 
16|You see, this is the way that God loved the 
world, the established order of the human race: He gave his only-begotten son, in order 
that everyone who believes in him won’t perish but instead would have that special 
fullness of life, eternal life. 
17|You see, God didn’t send His son into the world in 
order to deliver a guilty verdict against the world, but instead that through him He 
could come to the world’s rescue. 
18|He doesn’t judge and deliver a guilty verdict 
against the one who believes in him; but the one who doesn’t believe has already been 
judged guilty, because he hasn’t believed in the authority bequeathed upon[g] the only-
begotten son of God. 
19|The guilty verdict boils down to this: the light has come 
into the world, and mankind loved the darkness more than the light; the fact of the 
matter is, their deeds were evil. 
20|In fact, everyone who’s in the habit of doing 
commonplace, ugly things hates the light and isn’t going towards the light, in order not 
to have his deeds exposed. 
21|He who does what is the truth goes towards the light, 
in order that his deeds be made manifest since they have been accomplished in God.”
          
22|After these things happened, Jesus and his disciples went to Judea and 
started to spend time there, and he was baptizing and baptizing. 
23|Now John was 
also baptizing in Aenon which is near Salim, since there was a lot of water there which 
could be used for baptizing. People from everywhere kept on showing up flocking to him, 
and one after another was being baptized, 
24|as, you see, John hadn’t been thrown 
into jail yet. 
          
25|Now then, an argument broke out between John’s disciples and some 
Judeans concerning ritualistic purification, 
26|and they approached John and said, 
“Teacher, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, to whom you went 
on record as saying, ‘Take a look here—this fellow’s doing baptisms and everyone’s 
migrating towards him…’” 
27|John replied, “A person can’t whole-heartedly take 
to heart, accept, and embrace a single thing if it hadn’t been granted to him from 
heaven. 
28|It was your own selves who declared to me that I am not the Messiah, 
but rather I’m one sent as a missionary[h] to be a precursor to that fellow. 
29|A 
groom takes possession of[D] the bride when he takes her into the newlyweds’ suite to 
consummate the marriage. The best-man, the one who’s posted outside the suite listening 
for him to tell him that they’re ready to exit the suite and start the wedding party, is 
overwhelmed with joy[i] upon hearing the groom’s voice. So now, this is the same joy 
which has been fulfilled in me. 
30|That fellow must grow in popularity, while I 
taper off in popularity.
          
31|”The one from the higher spiritual plane above who’s going forth is over all. 
The one who exists out of the lower spiritual plane of the earth is from the earth and 
speaks as you’d expect as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is over all. 

32|What he beheld and heard—this is what he’s giving an official account of, and 
hardly anybody at all[E] whole-heartedly embraces and acts on his account. 
33|The 
one who whole-heartedly embraced his account put his stamp of approval on[j] the fact 
that God is true to His word. 
34|You see, the one God sent speaks God’s sentences; 
indeed, He does not limit the quantity of the Spirit which He gives[k]. 
35|The Father 
loves the son, and all things have been placed under his direct control[l]. 
*[a]one night…Lit: at night. The verb tense of went insinuates that this was a one-time visit.
*[b]spectacular miracles…Lit: signs
*[c]a first-hand understanding…Lit: see
*[d]not a baby…Lit: old
*[e]give formal accounts…our formal accounts…Lit: testify…testimony
*[f]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. Matt. 8:20.
*[g]in the authority bequeathed upon…Lit: in the name of
*[h]a missionary…Lit: a sent-one. Same root that word apostle is derived from.
*[i]is overwhelmed with joy…Lit: in joy rejoices. An expression; ref. note of Matt. 2:10.
*[j]put his stamp of approval on…Lit: sealed
*[k]He does not limit the quantity of the Spirit which He gives…Lit: He does not give the Spirit from out of a 
measure [or, from out of a fixed, finite quantity]. A figure of speech. 
*[l]placed under his direct control…Lit: given into his hand
*[m]hovers over him…Lit: dwells upon him

*[A]born from that spiritual plane where God exists …Lit: born from above. In the NT, the three concepts of 
the sky above, heaven, and the spiritual domain are conflated. 
*[B]water and spirit…The water refers to the water of repentance, such as the water baptism that John the 
Baptist performed. The water symbolizes a change in lifestyle. The spirit is the spiritual experience of 
regeneration which a person must undergo at the same time. In this regeneration, a person is reborn 
spiritually and the Holy Spirit comes and dwells in his regenerated spirit which is inside of him. The two, 
water and spirit, are the two elements of Christianity that go hand-in-hand: a change to live the right 
way and a spiritual life, a life in the Spirit.
*[C]the wind blows…Also: the Holy Spirit breathes wherever He pleases, and you hear the sound He makes, 
but you don’t know where He comes from or where He’s going to .The Gk. word used for wind here is 
pneuma (πνεῦμα/Strong’s 4151), the same one used for spirit; and since the definite article precedes 
pneuma, it would be Holy Spirit instead of spirit. Jesus is referring to both the actual wind and the Holy 
Spirit in this sentence.
*[D]takes possession of…Also: is having. First, is having means that this is the moment when the woman is 
no longer under the authority of her father but instead comes under the authority of her husband. 
Second, it means directly or insinuates indirectly that the groom is having sex with the bride.
[E]hardly anybody at all…Lit: nobody, as in the fuller context, Nobody received his testimony. (v.33) The 
one who received his testimony sealed that God is true. Note how John says in v. 32 that nobody 
received his testimony, then states the opposite in v.33, that some did receive his testimony. The word 
nobody is not to be taken literally; it is a figure of speech which is something like a combination of a 
synecdoche and an hyperbole. A key to detecting this figure of speech is that the contradiction occurs 
immediately after the premise. In this case the word nobody is followed up just a few words (not a few 
verses) later in v.32 with the one who received his testimony. John uses this figure of speech a few times 
in both his Gospel and in his epistles, and it can confuse the reader if he is unaware that this is a figure 
of speech, and to be taken with a grain of salt and not literally. A usage of a figure of speech similar to 
this in English might be: I posted all of the pictures of my vacation on social media, and—like—nobody 
commented on them. But the two people who did…

John
36|The one 
who believes in the son has that special fullness of life, eternal life. He who’s 
unconvinced and therefore disobedient, not believing in the son, won’t experience that 
special fullness of life; instead, the wrath of God hovers over him[m].”


&JOHN 4
1|So now, as Jesus became aware that the Pharisees heard that he’s making 
more disciples and doing more baptisms than John— 
2|and yet it wasn’t Jesus himself 
who was doing the baptisms, but it was his disciples instead— 
3|he abandoned Judea 
and departed once more for Galilee, 
4|and in doing so had to go through Samaria. 

5|So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar in the vicinity of where Jacob gave 
land to his son Joseph. 
6|Now one of Jacob’s wells was there, so Jesus, worn out from 
the trip, simply proceeded to sit down at the well. It was around noon.
          
7|A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Striking up a conversation, Jesus 
said to her, “Give me a drink of water,” 
8|seeing that his disciples had gone into the 
city to buy food. 
9|Engaging in the conversation, the Samaritan woman said,
      “How is it that you being a Jew ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink of 
water?” (You see, the Jews don’t have anything to do with the Samaritans.)
          
10|Jesus replied, “If you knew what God offers as a gift and who it is exactly 
who’s telling you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would’ve asked and he would’ve given you 
living water.”
          
11|The woman, engaged in the conversation, said, “Sir, you don’t have any 
bucket and the well is deep. So where did you get this so-called Living Water from? 

12|You’re not greater than our ancestor[a] Jacob, who gave us the well and 
personally drank from it on an ongoing basis (and so did his sons and his livestock), are 
you?”
          
13|Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks from this well will get thirsty 
again. 
14|But whoever were to drink from the water that I’ll give him—there’s no 
way at all that he’ll ever get thirsty again.”
          
15|The woman, drawn into the dialogue, said, “Sir, give me this water, so 
that I’ll never get thirsty again or have to come over here to draw water.”
          
16|He, following right along with everything spoken, said, “Go now—call 
your husband, and tell him to come over here.”
          
17|The woman answered, “I don’t have a husband.”
      Jesus, continuing on, told her, “Well-put to have said[b] that you don’t have a 
husband. 
18|The fact is, you’ve had five husbands, and the guy you’re sleeping 
with now[c] isn’t your husband. What you’ve stated is true.”
          
19|The woman, still engaged, said, “Sir, I can tell that you’re a prophet. 

20|Our ancestors held their worship services[A] on[d] this mountain but you all say 
that Jerusalem is the place where worship services must be held.”
          
21|Jesus, still continuing, told her, “Trust[e] me, lady—there’s coming a time 
when you won’t worship[B] the Father either on this mountain or in Jerusalem. 

22|You all worship what’s unknown to you; we, however, worship what’s known 
to us, since God’s rescue program[f] comes from out of the Jewish race. 
23|That 
aside, there’s coming a time—and it so happens to be now—when the true worshippers 
will worship the Father in the true way: in spirit[g], in a way that words fall short to 
describe. For indeed, the Father looks for these kind of people to worship Him. 

24|God is a spirit by nature[g], and those who worship Him must worship Him the 
true way: in spirit[h].”
          
25|The woman, whose interest hadn’t subsided, said, “I know that the 
Messiah, the one called ‘Christ,’ is coming. When that person finally does come, he’ll 
give us a rundown about everything and anything.”
          
26|He continued and said, “I am he, the One-And-Only-One, the one who’s 
talking to you this very moment.”
          
27|Just then, his disciples came back, and they were amazed that he was in 
the middle of speaking to a woman. But yet, nobody said, “What are you up to?[i]”, or, 
“Why are you talking to her?” 
28|So the woman left her bucket of water behind and 
departed for the city. She said to the people there, 
29|”Come see a man who told 
me everything I did wrong in life, in a nutshell.[j] He couldn’t be the Messiah, could he?” 

30|They left the city and started towards him.
          
31|Meanwhile, the disciples asked him time and again, “Teacher, eat 
something.” 
32|But he said, “I have food to eat which you have no knowledge of.” 

33|The disciples started repeating to one another, “Nobody brought him anything 
to eat, did they?” 
34|Jesus, engaging with them, said, “My ‘food’ is that I would do 
the will of He who sent me and that I would complete His work. 
35|Isn’t there a 
well-known expression which says, ‘There’s four more months until the harvest comes 
in’? Hey, I’m telling you all, stop with the tunnel-vision and look at what’s going on 
around you[k]—take a look at the fields: they’re a bright golden hue ready for harvest. 

36|The reaper is already getting paid at the end of the day for the last few days now and 
is gathering up a crop towards the harvest of that special fullness of life, eternal life, in 
order that the sower would rejoice with the reaper. 
37|In this, you see, the 
expression is dead-on, ‘One person sows and another person reaps’. 
38|I sent you 
to reap what you hadn’t toiled over; others have toiled, and you have joined in 
participating in their labor.”
          
39|Many from that Samaritan city believed in him through the woman’s 
account claiming “he told me everything I ever did.” 
40|So as the Samaritans 
approached him, they kept asking him to stay with them, and he remained there for 
two days. 
41|Many more believed on account of his message; 
42|furthermore, 
they kept on telling the woman, “It’s no longer the case that we believe simply as a 
result of your non-stop talking. You see, we have heard and know for a fact that this 
fellow truly is the savior of the world, the established order of the human race.”
          
43|From there, he departed after two days for Galilee; 
44|the fact is, 
Jesus frankly stated that a prophet gets no respect[l] in his hometown and among his 
relatives. 
45|So when he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him whole-
heartedly[m], everyone having seen what he did at the Passover festival in Jerusalem; for 
they too had gone to the festival.
          
46|So he once more went to Cana, Galilee, where he had turned the water 
into wine. There was a court official in Capernaum who had a malady of some sort[n]. 

47|This fellow heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee and went out to 
visit him and to ask that he would come over and heal his son, seeing that he was going 
to die. 
48|Jesus said to him, “If you all don’t get to see spectacular miracles[o], 
there’s no way at all you’re going to have faith and believe, now is there?” 

49|Distressed, the official said, “Sir, come over before my boy dies.” 
50|Fully 
aware, Jesus said, “Go—your son lives.” The man believed the statement which Jesus 
spoke to him and proceeded to go. 
51|Now his servants had already come by to 
meet him saying that his boy is alive, 
52|so he inquired of them what time it was 
when he got better. They said that the fever broke yesterday at one o’clock in the 
afternoon. 
53|The father knew that that was the time which Jesus told him, “Your 
son lives,” and he believed for himself, he and his entire household too. 
*[a]ancestor…Lit: father
*[b]well-put to have said…Also: well-stated to have said; you did good when you said; good job to have 
said; correct answer to have said
*[c]the guy you’re sleeping with now…Lit: whom you have now. Similar usage of have as in John 3:29; ref. 
note there
*[d]on…Lit: in. The usage of in when referring to being on a mountain idiomatic; John repeats this 
idiomatic usage of the word in in Rev. 1:9, on the island of Patmos.
*[e]trust…Also: believe
*[f]rescue program…Lit: salvation
*[g]God is a spirit by nature…Lit: God is spirit. The lack of a definite article emphasizes the fact that this is 
God’s nature.
*[h]in the true way: in spirit…Lit: in spirit and truth. A figure of speech called a hendiadys. Ref. note of 
Matt. 3:11.
*[i]What are you up to?…Lit: What are you looking for?
*[j]Come see a man who told me everything I did wrong in life, in a nutshell…In a reading of the GT, the 
woman insinuates the added words.
*[k]stop with the tunnel-vision and look at what’s going on around you…Lit: lift up your eyes
*[l]gets no respect…Lit: has no honor
*[m]welcomed him whole-heartedly…Lit: received him
*[n]a malady of some sort…Lit: a weakness. Ref. note of Matt. 4:23.
*[o]spectacular miracles…Lit: signs and wonders (v.48); sign (v. 54)

*[A]held their worship services…Lit: worshipped. Some liberties taken, as the worship John is referring to 
are the appearances before priests at the temple in Jerusalem, where animals were offered as sacrifices, 
etc., and not a church or synagogue service as we know it. The feud between the Jews and the 
Samaritans originated years ago when the northern tribes of Israel under Rehoboam (and the 
Samaritans are descended from them) severed ties with Judah. A political problem arose for Rehoboam, 
in that the temple was in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. He figured if his newly-seceded kingdom were to 
continue their pilgrimages to the Jerusalem temple, their sentiments and affections, and hence their 
political loyalty, would eventually return to Judah. For this reason, Rehoboam instituted religious 
observances in the north; this Samaritan woman refers to this.
[B]worship…Jesus refers to worship, both to the OT and the NT forms of worship. The OT worship 
consisted of appearances before priests at the temple, which included (but was not limited to) sacrificial 
offerings. NT worship is not like that; NT worship in its essence is spiritual. Humans are spiritual beings, 
God is a spirit, and we offer Him worship out of our spirits. No physical forms are necessary to do this, 
but man with his religious tendencies yields to the temptation of supplanting spiritual worship with 
physical or emotional forms.

54|This 
was yet a second spectacular miracle which Jesus did, having left Judea for Galilee.


&JOHN 5
1|After these things occurred, there was a Jewish holiday festival, and Jesus went 
down to Jerusalem. 
2|Among the citizens of Jerusalem, there was a pool at the Sheep 
Gate (which in Aramaic is called Bethesda), which has five porticos. 
3|In these porticos 
lay a multitude of those who are feeble with sicknesses of one sort or another[a], of the 
blind, the lame, and those with shriveled-up limbs, perpetually lying there. 
4|[A] 

5|Now there was a man with a sickness who had been there for thirty-eight years, and 
his sickness made him feeble. 
6|Seeing this fellow lying there, Jesus, knowing that he 
had been there for a long time, engaged him in conversation and said, “Do you want to 
get better?” 
7|The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no person to toss me into the pool 
when the water’s been agitated[B]. While it’s agitated and I’m on my way to the pool, 
someone else cuts in front of me.[b]” 
8|Jesus got to the point and said, “Get up, pick 
the cot up, take it, and walk around,” 
9|and the man got better immediately, picked 
his cot up, and walked around.
      But that was on a Sabbath. 
10|So now, the Judean Jews proceeded to say to 
the man who had been healed,
      “It’s the Sabbath, and you’re not allowed to pick up your cot and take it 
somewhere.”
          
11|He replied, “The guy who made me well told me, ‘Pick it up and walk 
around’.”
          
12|They asked, “Who’s the person who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk 
around’?” 
13|But the man who was healed didn’t know who it was; you see, Jesus 
had ducked out of sight and into the crowd. 
14|After all of this[c], Jesus found him 
in the temple and said, “I see you’re all better now. Don’t go about sinning, lest 
something worse happen to you.” 
15|The man left from there and reported to the 
Judeans that Jesus was the one who made him better. 
16|Because of this, the 
Judeans began to go after Jesus, because he did this[c] on the Sabbath. 
17|Jesus’s 
reply to them was, “Up to the present moment, my Father’s been doing good deeds, and 
is doing good deeds, and so am I[d].” 
18|So because of this, the Judeans were all the 
more trying to kill him, because he wasn’t just going about freeing people from their 
sicknesses on the Sabbath, but he also kept saying that God is his own Father, making 
himself out to be equal to God.
          
19|So Jesus proceeded to defend himself, “I’m telling you the honest-to-
goodness truth, I really am: the Son can’t do anything that’s from out of himself except 
for what he happens to see the Father doing. For what That One were to do, the Son 
does these same things and in the same manner. 
20|You see, the Father extends his 
close friendship to the Son and shows him everything which He in His own right does, 
and He’ll show him greater things than these—good deeds, that is—in order to dazzle 
you all. 
21|You see, just as the Father resurrects the dead and breathes life back 
into them, in the same way the Son breathes life back into whom he desires. 

22|So—no—the Father doesn’t judge anyone, reaching a guilty verdict, but instead 
has given the entirety of the judgment of mankind to the Son, 
23|in order that 
everyone would respect and honor the Son just as they respect and honor the Father. He 
who’s not respecting and honoring the Son doesn’t respect and honor the Father who 
sent him.
          
24|”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: he who hears 
my message and believes in the One who sent me has that special fullness of life, eternal 
life, and isn’t heading to a destination of judgment but instead has been transported 
from the place of departure of death to the destination of life. 
25|I’m telling you the 
honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: there’s coming a time (and in fact the time is now) 
when the dead will hear the voice of God’s Son and they—those who heard it—will 
live. 
26|For just as the Father has life in himself, in the same way the Son too has 
been granted to have life in himself. 
27|He has given authority to him to 
pronounce judgment, because he is the Man[e]. 
28|Don’t be amazed at this, that 
there’s coming a time in which everyone in the graveyard[f] will hear His voice 

29|and depart from that place: those who did the good things that one’s supposed to do 
will depart to an afterlife of that special fullness of life, but those who were in the habit of 
doing the petty, careless, thoughtless, mean, ugly things that one’s not supposed to do will 
depart to an afterlife of judgment resulting in a guilty verdict.[g]
          
30|”I can’t do anything from out of myself; just as I hear I judge, and My 
Judgment is right, since I will not seek the ‘Me-Will’ but rather the will of He who sent 
me. 
31|If I were to formally assert claims[h] about myself, my assertions would not 
be true. 
32|There’s Another One who makes formal claims about me, and I know 
that the assertions which He asserts about me are true. 
33|You have sent inquiries 
to John, and he has gone on record and formally asserted claims by means of the truth. 

34|I don’t take to heart and embrace[i] the formal claims from the human race[j], but 
instead I speak these words to you that you might be spared[k]. 
35|That fellow John 
was the Set-Ablaze and Shining Light, and you wanted to bask[l] in his light for a 
moment or two. 
36|I, however, have formal claims made concerning me which are 
greater than those concerning John; you see, the works the Father has given to me for me 
to follow through with them—these very works that I do formally register claims about 
me, namely that the Father sent me. 
37|And the One who sent me—the Father—
That One formally registered claims about me. You have neither heard His voice fully, 
nor have you beheld His outward appearance. 
38|You don’t have His concepts[m] 
sticking to you[n], because whom That One sent—you don’t believe in that person. 

39|Search the Scriptures, since you assume that you have eternal life by means of 
them. Those are where the formal claims about me are registered— 
40|but even so 
you don’t want to come to me in order to acquire that special fullness of life, eternal life.
          
41|”I don’t embrace and accept[o] admiration (the praise derived from being 
one’s pride and joy)[p] heaped upon me from people— 
42|but no—I have come to 
know you, that you don’t have the truth of God within you. 
43|I have come being 
sponsored by my Father and in His authority[q], and you don’t embrace and accept me. 
If another were to come merely by virtue of his own reputation, having no sponsorship 
to speak of[q], then you would embrace and accept that guy. 
44|How is it possible 
for you to believe and have faith, while embracing and accepting admiration from 
others and not seeking the admiration from the One True God?
      “
45|Don’t assume that I will submit damning accusations against the lot of 
you to the Father. Moses, as defined by what he wrote in the Old Testament, is the one 
leveling the damning accusations—the one in whom you all have set your hope. 

46|You see, if you were occupied with believing and trusting in what Moses wrote, 
you would be occupied with believing in me, as that fellow wrote about me indeed.

*[A]Verse 4 is one of several spurious verses added to the NT well-after the NT was written. Besides 
missing from best manuscripts of John’s Gospel, it has the familiar characteristics of the spurious 
embellishments…attempting to protect God’s majesty; more condemnation; odd-sounding miracles. 
Translated here for reference:
For an angel of the Lord from time to time went down into the pool and was agitating the water. So now, 
the first to get in after the agitation of the water was becoming whole of whatever disease he was 
having for some time.
[B]water’s been agitated…For centuries, people have been taking dips in pools, saunas, baths, springs, 
etc. for therapy, to heal them of whatever ails them. This is the case here. The question here is how the 
water got agitated (stirred up). Attendants may have stirred it for a few minutes from time to time, or 
perhaps some of the water was discharged from a feeding aqueduct and as a side-effect of the pool 
being refilled, the rushing water caused the agitation.

&JOHN 6
1|After these events, Jesus departed for the other side of the Sea of Galilee 
(otherwise known as Tiberias). 
2|A large crowd followed him, because they were seeing 
miracle after miracle[a] that he did for[b] those feeble with a sickness of one sort or 
another. 
3|Jesus hiked up a large hill and proceeded to sit down there with his 
disciples. 
4|Now the Passover wasn’t too far off, the Jewish religious holiday festival. 

5|So Jesus, after lifting up his eyes and seeing that a large crowd was approaching, 
engaged Philip, “Where can we go buy food from in order to feed them?” 
6|Now he 
was saying this to test him; the fact is, he knew what he was about to do. 
7|Philip 
replied, “$20,000[c] worth of bread wouldn’t suffice for each person to get even just a bit.” 

8|One of the disciples, Andrew Simon Peter’s brother, jumped in and said, 

9|“There’s a lad here who has five loaves of barley-bread and two grilled[d] fishes. 
Apart from these, what’s available for such a crowd as this?” 
10|Jesus, adding to this, 
said, “Get the people to find a spot, have a seat, and relax[e].”
      Now there was a lot of grass in the area, so around five-thousand grown men—
not to mention the women and children—found a place to sit. 
11|Thereupon, Jesus 
took the break, offered thanks, and distributed it to those seated, and the same with the 
fish, as much as they kept wanting. 
12|As they were filled, he further said to his 
disciples, “Gather the leftover scraps, lest we waste anything.” 
13|So they gathered 
and filled twelve baskets of scraps from what was leftover by those who had eaten, 
leftovers from out of the five loaves of the barley-bread.[A] 
14|The people, upon 
seeing the miracle[f] that he did, began saying, “This fellow really is the Prophet who 
comes to the world.” 
15|So Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and seize 
him and carry him off to make him king, withdrew alone into the large hill.
          
16|As it had gotten late, his disciples went down to the lake, 

17|boarded a boat, and began making their way to the other side of the lake, to 
Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus hadn’t joined them yet; 

18|furthermore, strong gusts of wind began to stir over the lake. 
19|Having 
reached the point where they had rowed around 3 or 3.5 miles (4.5 or 5.5 km)[g], they 
saw Jesus walking about on top of the lake, and he was getting near the boat. They 
became frightened. 
20|He engages with them, “It’s me, don’t be afraid.” 

21|Then they kept on wanting to take him into the boat, but in no time[B] the boat 
landed on the shore that they were destined for.
          
22|The next day, the crowd which stood on the other side of the lake 
observed that at the time they departed there weren’t any other boats there except for the 
one, and since Jesus hadn’t joined his disciples in the boat, the disciples had departed 
alone instead. 
23|That aside, other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place 
where the Lord gave thanks and they ate the bread, 
24|so when the crowd saw that 
Jesus wasn’t there nor were his disciples, they boarded these boats and went to 
Capernaum looking for Jesus.
          
25|When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, 
“Teacher, when did you get here?” 
26|Jesus replied, “I’m telling you the honest-to-
goodness truth, I really am: you weren’t looking for me because you witnessed a 
miracle but because you participated in eating the bread and ate until you were full. 

27|Don’t work for food that has an expiration date but instead for non-perishable 
food, for food which has no expiration date that leads to eternal life, which the Man[h] 
will give you. You see, the Father—God—decreed and guaranteed that this is the man 
who is approved by Him[i].”
          
28|So they said, “How shall we go about doing the things of God?”
          
29|Jesus replied, “This is how you do the things of God: believe in that 
person whom He sent.”
          
30|So they said, “So now, what miraculous sign[C] do you perform, in order 
that we would see it and believe in you? What can you do? 
31|Our ancestors ate 
bread called manna while in the wilderness, just as it’s recorded in Scripture, ‘He gave 
them bread from the sky—from heaven—to eat’.”
          
32|Jesus said, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: 
Moses hasn’t given you the bread from heaven; instead, my Father gives you the True 
Bread from heaven. 
33|You see, God’s bread is what comes down from heaven and 
gives life to the world, the established order of the human race.”
          
34|So they said, “Sir, give us this bread from now on.”
          
35|Jesus said, “I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to me will not 
hunger—not a chance—and there’s no way at all that he who believes in me will ever 
thirst again. 
36|That aside, though, I said that you’ve taken the opportunity to have 
a good look at me and won’t believe in me. 
37|Everyone whom the Father gives me 
will reach me, and there’s no way whatsoever that I’ll refuse him, shut him out, or reject 
him, 
38|since I haven’t come down from heaven in order to do my own will but 
rather the will of the One who sent me. 
39|This is the will of the One who sent me: 
that I would not lose a single person He has given me, or have him come to ruin, but 
instead I will usher him into an afterlife of bliss on the Day of Reckoning[D]. 
40|For 
this is the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe in him would have that 
special fullness of life, eternal life, and I personally will usher him into an afterlife of 
bliss on the Day of Reckoning.”
          
41|Then the Judeans started arguing about him, because he said, “I am the 
Bread which comes down from heaven.” 
42|They were stuck on, “Isn’t this just 
Jesus, Joseph’s son? Don’t we know about the father and the mother?[E] How can he just 
now say, ‘I have come down out of heaven’?” 
43|Jesus responded, “No need to 
argue with one another. 
44|No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me 
reels him in[j]. And I myself will usher him into an afterlife of bliss on the Day of 
Reckoning. 
45|In the back half of the Old Testament[k], it’s recorded, ‘And everyone 
will receive instruction[l] from God.’ Everyone who’s heard from the Father and has 
learned from such instruction comes to me— 
46|and not because any given person 
has seen the Father (except for the one who’s from God and exists as such—this fellow’s 
seen the Father).
          
47|”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: a believer has 
that special fullness of life, eternal life. 
48|I am the Bread of Life. 
49|Your 
ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and, nevertheless, eventually died. 
50|This 
fellow—the one who came down out of heaven so that anyone could eat from him and 
not die—is the bread. 
51|I am the Living Bread which came down out of the sky, 
from heaven. If someone were to eat from this bread, he will live forever, experiencing 
that special fullness of life. Moreover, the bread that I will give on behalf of the world—
my flesh—is life.”
          
52|So the Judeans proceeded to squabble with one another, “How can this 
guy give us his flesh to eat?” 
53|Jesus said, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness 
truth, I really am: if you won’t eat the Man’s flesh and drink his blood, you don’t have 
life within you. 
54|He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has that special 
fullness of life, eternal life, and I will usher him into an afterlife of bliss on the Day of 
Reckoning. 
55|You see, my true flesh is true food, and my true blood is drink[m]. 

56|He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood sticks to me[n], and I to him. 

57|Just as the Living Father sent me, and I live through the Father, the one feeding 
off me—that’s the one who’ll live through me. 
58|This is the bread which came 
down out of the sky—but not like the way the ancestors ate and died.” 
59|He said 
these things in a synagogue in Capernaum, teaching there.
          
60|So then, many of his disciples who listened said, “This is a tough 
concept. Who can listen to it and take heed of it?” 
61|Jesus, aware within himself that 
his disciples were grumbling about this, told them, “You can’t get past this? 

62|Would it make any difference if you were to see me ascend into heaven from the 
spot I was just standing at?[F] 
63|The Spirit is what makes something come alive; the 
flesh—man’s best-effort apart from God—is no help at all. The remarks which I’ve 
spoken to you are spirit and are life—that is, are of a spiritual nature and are alive by 
nature. 
64|That aside, some among you don’t believe what I’m saying.” You see, 
Jesus knew from the outset that some of them wouldn’t believe, and knew who it is who 
would betray him. 
65|He continued, “Because of this I have spoken to you all, 
because no one can come to me except if it has been granted to him from the Father.”
          
66|As a result, many of his disciples left to head back to where they came from 
originally and weren’t travelling about with him anymore. 
67|Jesus then said to the 
Twelve, “Don’t you want to part ways too?” 
68|Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, 
what things[o] shall we leave you for and go to? You have messages of that special 
fullness of life, eternal life; 
69|and we—we have believed and have come to 
recognize that you are the Holy One of God.” 
70|Jesus replied to them, “Have I not 
personally selected each one of you, the Twelve, yet one of you is a back-stabber?” 

*[a]miracle after miracle…Lit: signs. The verb tense for were seeing changes the rendering somewhat.

*[h]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[i]decreed and guaranteed that this person is the man who is approved by Him…Lit: sealed this [man]. 
Also, see the way John used the word sealed in Rev. chapters 6, 7.
*[j]reels him in…Lit: drags him
*[k]the back half of the Old Testament…Lit: the prophets
*[l]receive instruction…Also: be taught
*[m]my true flesh is true food, and my true blood is drink…Or perhaps: my flesh is true food, and my blood 
is true drink.
*[n]sticks to me…Or: dwells in me
*[o]what things…Or: whom. The text is ambiguous.

*[A]So they gathered and filled twelve baskets of scraps from what was leftover by those who had eaten, 
leftovers from out of the five loaves of the barley-bread…Lit: So they gathered and filled twelve baskets 
of scraps out of the five loaves of the barley [bread] that they leftover by those who had eaten. The way 
John penned this sentence in its literal form is not lock-tight from a logical perspective, even given the 
leeway which Gk. allows in reordering sequences of words. In other words, what John should’ve written 
is this: So they gathered and filled twelve baskets of scraps that were leftover by those who had eaten 
out of the five loaves of the barley [bread]. The movement of the clause that were leftover by those who 
had eaten and the changing of it from active to passive voice (from that they leftover to that were 
leftover) would’ve had made what he said more logically coherent. Of course, we understand what he 
meant.
*[B]in no time…Lit: immediately. John again (see previous note from v. 13) loosely constructs the logic of a 
sentence; in its literal rendering, it appears to the reader that once Jesus boarded the boat, the boat 
miraculously transported itself in a split-second (as insinuated by the word immediately) to the 
destination shore. I doubt if that was the case—rather, it was near the destination in the first place.
*[C]miraculous sign…The Jews were following the guidelines outlined in the OT for vetting a prophet 
(Exod. 7:9; Deut.13:1–5). As John has stated in length in earlier parts of his gospel, Jesus did miraculous 
signs. In fact, the crowd had just chased him down because he’d walked on water. The problem was that 
that wasn’t good enough—they wanted him to produce a miracle on-demand. This is symptomatic of 
unbelief, the stubborn refusal to believe.
*[D]I will usher him into an afterlife of bliss on the Day of Reckoning…Lit: I will raise him up [resurrect him] 
in the Last Day. This is connected to what Jesus said in John 5:29. In 6:39 here, raise him up in Gk. is 
equivalent to resurrect him, and in the NT resurrection refers to life-after-death. A phrase like the Last 
Day is similar to other phrases found in the Bible, such as the last days [plural] (Isa. 2:2; Mic. 4:1; Acts 
2:17; 2 Tim. 3:1; 2 Pet. 3:3); the last hour; those days; that day; etc. All these phrases in general refer to 
the time of a fulfillment of a prophecy or a promise of some sort. According to its usage in the NT, we 
are living in the Last Days. This means we’re living in the fulfillment of the promises in the OT and in the 
Gospels of the fulfillment of Jesus’s mission to die and to be resurrected and the consequent access to 
God through faith in him, even for the Gentile; the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in all believers; God 
working through the church; etc. But the Last Day [singular] refers to the fulfillment of a different 
promise, that is, what God will do with those who died, in this case with believers who died trusting in 
Him. For unbelievers, the Last Day is the Day of Judgment.
*[E]Don’t we know about the father and the mother?…The word about doesn’t appear in the GT, but the 
insinuation—which is present when carried over into English via a literal rendering—is a result of the GT 
saying the father and the mother rather than his father and mother, or something. Furthermore, the 
Judeans just finished Joseph as Jesus’s father, then a few words later refer to him as the father instead 
of saying Joseph again. The insinuation is that they have a low opinion about Mary and Joseph. This 
could be for a few reasons, because Mary and Joseph don’t live in Judea and aren’t part of the political 
hierarchy. Or because they’re poor, they’re common laborers. Or perhaps Mary’s virgin birth was 
assumed to be an adulterous relationship. But whatever low opinion they had of Mary and Joseph, it 
could not have been because of their genealogy.
[F]Would it make any difference if you were to see me ascend into heaven from the spot I was just 
standing at?…Lit: So then, if you were to see the son of man go up from the place he was just at?…This is 
a best-guess at what Jesus meant; I’m not exactly sure. 

John

John
71|He was side-railed in talking about Judas Son of Simon Iscariot. Indeed, this 
guy—one of the Twelve—was intending to betray him, thinking it over and over.


&JOHN 7
1|After all of this, Jesus was travelling about Galilee; indeed, he hadn’t been 
wanting to travel throughout Judea, since the Judeans wouldn’t let up in trying to kill 
him. 
2|The Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was coming up, 
3|so his brothers said to 
him, “Relocate from here and make your way to Judea, so that your disciples too might 
behold the miraculous works that you do. 
4|When you get right down to it, no one 
does something in seclusion when he’s striving to be a well-known, public figure. If you 
do these miraculous works, reveal yourself to the world.” 
5|The fact is, his brothers 
hadn’t been believing in him all the while either. 
6|So Jesus, consuming the remark, 
told them, “My Time has not yet arrived, but Your Time is always ready. 
7|The 
world—the established order of humans—isn’t able to hate you all, but it hates me, 
since I go on record about it, that it’s deeds are evil. 
8|You all go on over to the 
festival; Me, though—I’m not going to this festival, because my time has not yet been 
fulfilled.” 
9|Having said these things, he stayed in Galilee.
          
10|As his brothers went down to the festival, then he too went, not openly 
but secretly instead. 
11|So then, the Judeans kept searching for him at the festival 
and kept on repeating, “Where is that guy?” 
12|There was a huge amount of 
murmuring and grumbling about him by the crowds; some kept saying that he’s good, 
but others kept saying, “No—on the contrary—he leads the crowd astray.” 
13|No 
one, however, was talking about him in public due to the fear of the Judeans.
          
14|Now already midway through the festival, Jesus went over to the temple 
and proceeded to teach. 
15|The Judeans were amazed, “How does this fellow 
know the Scriptures so well, being uneducated?” 
16|Jesus replied, “My teaching is 
not mine but rather the One who sent me. 
17|If someone desires to do His will, he 
himself will discern whether the teaching originates from God or whether I’m speaking 
on my own. 
18|He who speaks on his own seeks his own glory; the one who seeks 
the glory of the One who sent him—that person is sincere and no corruption[a] of thought 
process is in him. 
19|Hasn’t Moses given us the Old Testament Law, and not a one of 
you puts its mandates into practice[b]? Why are you trying to kill me?”
          
20|The crowd answered, “You’re demon-possessed. Who’s trying to kill 
you?”
          
21|Jesus replied, “I did one miraculous work and every one of you wonders 
whether I obeyed the Sabbath. 
22|All throughout, the Law of Moses[A] has given you the 
rite of circumcision (not that it originated from the Law of Moses but instead originated 
from the patriarchs of old[B], who predate Moses), and you circumcise a man on the 
Sabbath. 
23|If a man gets circumcised on the Sabbath in order to comply with the 
Law of Moses, are you angry at me because I restored a person to good health on the 
Sabbath? 
24|Refrain from deciding or judging according to how things appear on 
the surface; make the correct judgment[c] instead.”
          
25|Some of those from Jerusalem then proceeded to say, “Isn’t this the guy 
they’re trying to kill? 
26|Take a look—he’s speaking aloud in public, and they’re 
not saying a thing to him. 
27|That aside—we know what this guy’s all about[d]; but 
when the Messiah, the Christ, does in fact come, no one’s been able to figure out[C] what 
his raison d’être will be[d].” 
28|So while Jesus was teaching in the temple, he cried 
out, “You both know me and you know where I’m from. I haven’t come from myself. 
Aside from that, the One who sent me is true, Whom you don’t know. 
29|I know 
Him, since I am from Him and that’s the One who sent me.” 
30|So they tried to 
apprehend him, but no one managed to lay a hand on him, because his time hadn’t come 
yet. 
31|But among those in the crowd, many believed in him. They kept saying, 
“When the Messiah does come, will he perform more miracles[e] than what this fellow’s 
done?”
          
32|The Pharisees heard that the crowd was chatting about these matters, 
matters which are related to him, so the High Priests and the Pharisees sent temple 
police to apprehend him. 
33|Jesus then said, “I’ll be with you for yet a little while 
longer and head on back to the One who sent me. 
34|You’ll look for me and won’t 
be able to find me, and where I’ll be, you can’t go.” 
35|So the Judeans said to 
themselves, “Where’s this guy planning to go that we won’t be able to find him? He’s not 
intending to go to the Jews scattered throughout the Roman Empire and teach the Greek-
speaking Jews, is he? 
36|What about this statement, ‘You’ll look for me and won’t 
be able to find me,’ and, ‘Where I’ll be, you can’t go’?”
          
37|On the last day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, “If someone is 
thirsty, let him come to me and drink. 
38|He who believes in me, just like the verse 
in the Old Testament says, ‘Streams of water from deep inside of him will flow out of 
him’.” 
39|Now he was talking about the Spirit, he whom they were going to 
receive, that is, those who believed in him. You see, the Spirit had not yet come, since 
Jesus had not yet been glorified.
          
40|Then out of the crowd these words arose and were spoken, “This person 
really is the Prophet promised in the Old Testament.” 
41|Others were saying, “This 
person is the Messiah.” But others were saying, “Certainly the Messiah won’t come 
from Galilee, will he? 
42|Isn’t there a verse in the Old Testament which says that 
the Messiah will be a descendant of David and will be from Bethlehem, the town where 
David was from?” 
43|So the crowd split into factions over him, 
44|and some 
of them kept wanting to apprehend him; instead, no one laid a hand on him.
          
45|The police returned to the High Priests and the Pharisees, who told those 
guys, “Why didn’t you haul him off?” 
46|The police replied, “Never before has a 
man spoken the way this man has.” 
47|The Pharisees replied, “You haven’t been 
led astray too, have you? 
48|Not a single one of the rulers or the Pharisees have 
believed in him, have they? 
49|Instead, the only ones who’ve believed in him is this 
bunch, the ones who don’t understand the Law of Moses—the accursed.” 

50|Nicodemus, the one who visited him earlier on and who’s one of them, 
interjected and said to them, 
51|”Our code of law, the Law of Moses, doesn’t allow 
a verdict to be rendered unless the defendant is first heard from and what he did is 
known, now does it?” 
52|They replied, “You’re not a Galilean-sympathizer[f] too, 
are you? Check into it and—you’ll see—no prophet from Galilee gets brought to 
prominence[g].” 
*[a]sincere and no corruption…Or: true and no unrighteousness
*[b]puts its mandates into practice…Lit: does
*[c]make the correct judgment…Lit: judge the righteous judgment. A figure of speech.
*[d]what this guy’s all about…what his raison d’être will be…Lit: whence he is…whence he is. Use of 
whence is the key part of the well-known expression that these phrases are; ref. note of Luke 13:25.
*[e]miracles…Lit: signs
*[f]Galilean-sympathizer…Lit: out of the Galilee. Or perhaps, from Galilee; the same phrase appeared 
verbatim in v. 41.
*[g]gets brought to prominence…Lit: raised up
*[h]Verse 53 omitted as spurious. See note of John 8:1.

*[A]the Law of Moses…Lit: Moses. The man Moses is a metonymy for the code of Law he wrote, the Torah, 
the first five books of the Bible.
*[B]the patriarchs of old…Lit: the fathers. This refers to Abraham and his heirs. Though circumcision was 
included in the Law of Moses, it has an earlier origin and is therefore subject to the covenant where it 
was introduced. Paul reiterates this point in Gal. 3:17.
[C]no one’s been able to figure out…Lit: no one knows. John writes the phrase where he’s from three 
times in short succession: twice in v. 27 and once in v. 28. The word for know (ginōskō, 
γινώσκω/Strong’s 1097) in this occurrence (has been able to figure out) is a different word for know 
than what he uses for the other two occurrences (oida, οἶδα/Strong’s 1492). Generally speaking, John 
prefers oida over ginōskō, so he’s signaling the employment a meaning which differs from oida, and 
hence ginōskō as used here more accurately means to figure out rather than to know.

12|He talked to them again. “I am the light of the world. There’s no way 
whatsoever that one of my followers walks about in darkness; instead, he’ll have the 
light of life.”
          
13|The Pharisees then said, “You’re stating claims[a] about yourself; your 
claims aren’t true.”
          
14|Jesus formulated a reply, “If I state claims about myself, such claims are 
true, because I know what I’m all about and what my agenda is[b]. You, however, don’t 
know what you’re all about and what your agenda is. 
15|You judge[C] according to 
the flesh, i.e. whether one is going through the motions of or giving the outward appearance of 
following God’s commandments. I’m not judging anyone. 
16|Yet even if I were to 
judge, my judgment is spot-on[c], because I’m not alone in my judgment, but instead, I 
and the Father who sent me agree together in judgment. 
17|Now it’s recorded in your 
code of law (the Law of Moses) that the testimony of two individuals[d] who agree 
establishes truth[e]. 
18|I am one individual who testifies about myself, and the 
Father who sent me testifies about me.”
          
19|So they proceeded to say to him, “Where is your father?”
      Jesus replied, “You know neither me nor my Father. Had you known me, you 
would’ve known my Father.” 
20|He made these remarks while teaching in the 
temple treasury. No one apprehended him, since his moment hadn’t come yet.
          
21|He spoke to them once more. “I’m heading out. You’ll try to find me, but 
you’ll die in your sins[D] (i.e., there’s not a chance in hell you’ll succeed): where I’m headed, 
you cannot go.” 
22|Then the Judeans proceeded to say, “He’s not going to kill 
himself, is he, since he said, ‘where I’m headed, you cannot go’?” 
23|He proceeded 
to tell them, “You all are from the ‘down below,’ the carnal domain; I’m from the ‘up 
above,’[E] the spiritual domain. You all are from this world, this established order of 
humans; I’m not from this world. 
24|I told you all that you’ll die in your sins[D]. 
Indeed, if you won’t believe that I am the one-and-only-one[f], you’ll literally die in your 
sins[D].” 
25|Then they proceeded to say, “Who are you?” Jesus said, “Do I need to 
repeat whatever I’ve been saying from day one?[F] 
26|I have a lot of stuff stored in 
my head to say about you and to pass judgment, but never mind that. The One who sent 
me is sincere and true, and I speak to the world these things I heard from Him.” 

27|They didn’t understand that he was speaking to them about the Father. 

28|So then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Man[g], then you’ll understand that I 
am the one-and-only-one[f], and I do nothing from myself, but rather these things which I 
speak, I speak just as the Father instructed me. 
29|The One who sent me is with 
me. He hasn’t left me by myself, since I always do the things which please Him.” 

30|While speaking these things, many believed in him.
          
31|Then Jesus proceeded to say to the Judeans who just believed in him, “If 
you stick with[h] My Message, you’re truly my disciples, 
32|and you’ll know and 
understand the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
          
33|They replied, “We’re descendants of Abraham and haven’t ever been 
enslaved; how can you say ‘the truth will set you free’?”
          
34|Jesus replied, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: 
everyone who practices the archetypical sin[i] is a slave of sin. 
35|The slave doesn’t 
stay with the household forever; the son stays forever. 
36|So if the son sets you 
free, you’ll be free indeed. 
37|I know you’re descendants of Abraham; never mind 
you’re trying to kill me, because you’ve made no accommodations within yourselves 
for My Message. 
38|I speak what I’ve seen from the Father; but you, however—you 
put into practice what you’ve heard from your father.”
          
39|They retorted, “Our father—our ancestor—is Abraham.”
      Jesus then says, “Had you been Abraham’s offspring, you would have been 
acting like Abraham. 
40|But at this present time you’re trying to kill me, a person 
who’s spoken the truth to you, which truth he heard from God. Abraham didn’t act this 
way. 
41|You put into practice the deeds of your father.”
      So they said, “We were not born out of wedlock, the result of two people who 
just slept together. We have one father: God.”
          
42|Jesus said, “If God were your father, you would love me. You see, I came 
from God and arrived here. No, I have not spoken from out of my own self, but instead 
I have spoken from That Person who sent me. 
43|Why don’t you understand My 
Speech? Because you can’t hear My Message? 
44|As far as you’re concerned, 
you’re from that other father—the devil—and you want to put into practice the desires 
of your father. That creature was a murderer from day one, and doesn’t side with, 
defend, or support[j] the truth, since truth is not in him. When he utters the archetypical 
lie[i], he’s speaking from out of his personal repository[k], since he is a liar—indeed, the 
Propagator of Lies[l]. 
45|I, though—because I speak the truth, you all don’t believe 
me[m]. 
46|Who among you exposes sin in my life? If I speak truth, why don’t you 
believe me[m]? 
47|The one whose existence is from God listens to and takes heed 
of[n] God’s sayings. Here’s the reason you don’t listen and take heed: you’re not from 
God.”
          
48|The Judeans took this in and responded, “Didn’t we just nail it when we 
said you’re a Samaritan and you’re demon-possessed?” 
49|Jesus replied, “I’m not 
demon-possessed; on the contrary, I honor my Father. You, however, dishonor and 
disrespect me. 
50|I’m not seeking my own glory; the One who seeks and judges is. 

51|I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: if someone keeps My 
Message, there’s no way that he’ll stare at death from now to the end of time—no way.”
          
52|The Judeans said, “Now we know for sure that you’re demon-possessed. 
Abraham died and so did the Old Testament prophets, but you say, ‘If someone keeps My 
Message, there’s no way that he’ll stare at death from now to the end of time—no way’.” 

53|You’re not greater than our ancestor, our father Abraham, who was someone 
who died, are you? The prophets all died too. What do you fashion yourself to be?”
          
54|Jesus replied, “If I were to glorify myself, my glory would be nothing. 
My Father is the one glorifying me, whom you say is our God. 
55|You have not 
come to the point where you know and understand Him, but I have first-hand 
knowledge of Him. And if I were to say that I don’t know Him, I would be just like any-
old liar[o]; instead, I know Him, and I keep His message. 
56|Your ancestor Abraham 
was thrilled that he would see My Day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”
          
57|The Judeans said back to him, “You’re not even fifty years old yet, and 
you’ve seen Abraham?”
          
58|Jesus said, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: 
before Abraham came into being, I existed and exist as the-one-and-only-one[p].” 

*[a] stating claims…Lit: witnessing

*[A]Verses 1-11 of this chapter (and John 7:53b, the verse right before) are the story of the woman caught 
in adultery. For reference, this is translated in the note following. This story indeed is a beautiful 
illustration of the gospel, and this is the reason why it was spliced into the Gospel of John after John 
wrote it, as it is a spurious addition: the external evidence (i.e. the manuscript evidence) is 
overwhelming.
As far as the internal aspects of this passage (and this is quite subjective), the GT of this passage appears 
to be more polished than what John writes (John’s text is herky-jerky); this passage is more fluid and 
therefore easier to translate that what’s found in John’s gospel. Furthermore, John tends to shy away 
from using specific, descriptive words such as v. 4/in the very act (ep autophoros,  ἐπ' αὐτοφώρῳ); vv. 
6,7,8,10/crouched down and stood up (kata kuptō/κάτω κύψας and anakuptō/ἀνακύψας).
The fact that Jesus was writing on the ground with his finger is a bit weird. It also begs the question, if 
Jesus was teaching in the temple, and all the temple flooring is made of stone, then how could he write 
something with just his finger, seeing that there’s no soil wherewith to form recognizable letters in?
*[B]7:53And each one went home, 8:1and Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2He appeared in the temple 
early in the morning, and all the folk-people began to come to him, and he sat teaching them. 3The 
Scribes and the Pharisees brought him a woman caught by surprise in adultery, and stood her right in 
front of everyone. 4They said to him, “Teacher, this here woman was caught in the very act of adultery. 
5Now in the Law of Moses it’s commanded that such a person be stoned to death. So what do you have 
to say?” 6They were saying this to test him, so that they would have something to accuse him of. Jesus 
was crouched down and kept on writing on the ground. 7As they persisted in questioning him, he 
straightened up and asked them, “Let he who’s without sin throw the first stone.” 8He crouched down 
again and continued writing on the ground. 9One by one, the listeners began to leave, from the oldest, 
and he was left alone, the woman being right in front. 10Jesus straightened up and told her, “Woman, 
where are they? No one’s condemning you.” 11She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Nor do I condemn 
you. Go and, from now on, don’t sin anymore.”
*[C]judge…Refers to actual judging in a court of law and judging outside of a court of law, so as to draw 
conclusions about people so as to write them off. Ref. Matt. 7:1.
*[D]die in your sins…Or: not a chance in hell you’ll succeed; you’ll die trying. This is an expression, and the 
first time Jesus uses it (v. 21), he uses it as an expression. When he uses it the other times (v. 24), he 
means it literally.
*[E]down below…up above…The definition of these as the carnal domain and the spiritual domain 
respectively is confirmed in Col. 3:1,2,5
[F]Do I need to repeat whatever I’ve been saying from day one?…Various translators disagree on what 
exactly he meant by this fragment. In my opinion, John left out some words that he assumed the reader 
would understand and fill in. This is common in conversational speech, English included. In addition, it 
may be that the text in the UBS Gk. NT, which inserts a space and renders three letters as two words o ti 
(ὅ τι), (ὅ/Strong’s 3739), (τι/Strong’s 5100)(could instead be rendered with no space in the single word 
hoti (whatsoever; whatever), which is the nominative singular neuter form of hostis (whosoever; ὅστις), 
(ὅστις/Strong’s 3748).

1|While passing through, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. 

2|His disciples asked, “Teacher, who sinned, this fellow or his parents, in order for 
him to have become blind?” 
3|Jesus replied, “Neither this man sinned nor his parents, 
but instead that the works of God would be manifested in him. 
4|We must continue 
to work doing the works of He who sent me[A] until we run out of daylight[B]. Night’s 
coming, and nobody will be able to get any work done, because it’ll be too dark to see. 

5|When I’m in the world, the established order of humans, I am a light to the world.” 

6|Having said this, he spat on the ground and formed a wad of mud out of the saliva 
and rubbed the mud on the blind man’s eyes, 
7|and told him, “Go on over to the 
Siloam (translated ‘Sent’) pool and wash yourself off in it.[C]” So he left and washed 
himself off in the pool and went his way able to see.
          
8|Then the neighbors and those who used to stare at him because he was a 
beggar began to say,
      “Isn’t this guy the one who sits and begs?”
          
9|Others began to say, “Ya, that’s the guy.”
      Others began to say, “No, no, he just looks like him.”
      That fellow proceeded to say, “Uh-uh, it’s me.”
          
10|They proceeded to say, “How did you gain your sight?”
          
11|That fellow replied, “The man called Jesus made some mud and rubbed 
it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go on over to the Siloam pool and wash yourself off.’ So I 
left, washed myself, and gained my sight.”
          
12|They said, “Where is that fellow?”
      He then says, “I don’t know.”
          
13|They then take him (the person who used to be blind) to the Pharisees. 

14|Now the day of the week that Jesus made the mud and gave him his sight was 
Saturday—the Sabbath. 
15|So the Pharisees asked him once again,
      “How did you gain your sight?”
      He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed myself off, and now I can see.” 
          
16|Then some of the Pharisees proceeded to say, “This guy—this…this 
person—is not from God, since he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”
      But others proceeded to say, “How can a person who’s a sinner perform such 
miracles[a]?” And they split into factions over him. 
          
17|So they then say to the blind man, “What do you have to say about him, 
since he gave you your sight?” He said, “He’s a prophet.” 
18|So now, the Judeans 
didn’t believe what was being claimed concerning him, that he was blind and gained his 
sight, until they called for the parents of the man who gained his sight. 
19|They 
questioned them,
      “Is this fellow your son, whom you’re saying was born blind? So how is it that he 
can see now?”
          
20|His parents comeback was, “We know that this is our son, and that he 
was born blind, 
21|but we don’t know how it is that he can see now, nor do we 
know who gave him his sight. Ask him, he’s an adult. He can speak for himself now.”
          
22|His parents said these things because they were consumed with the fear 
of the Judeans. The fact of the matter is that the Pharisees had already decided that if 
anyone should profess that he is the Messiah, the Christ, he’ll be excommunicated. 

23|This is the reason his parents said, “He’s an adult, ask him.”
          
24|They then called for the man, the one who was blind, a second time and 
said to him, “Come clean on this and tell us the truth.[b] We know that this man is a 
sinner.” 
          
25|So that fellow answered, “I have no idea if he’s a sinner. But what I do 
know is that I was blind and now I can see.”
          
26|So they said, “What did he do to you? How did he grant you your 
sight?” 
          
27|He replied, “I told you already and you didn’t listen. Why do you want 
to hear it all over again? Surely you too don’t want to become his disciples, now do you?”
          
28|Then they gave him a tongue-lashing, “You’re that guy’s disciple?—
We’re disciples of Moses. 
29|We know that God has spoken to Moses and that this is 
recorded in the Old Testament Law of Moses, but we don’t know if this guy needs to get his 
head straightened out[c].”
          
30|The man retorted, “What’s so amazing about this is that you don’t know 
if he’s a wacko or not[c], but he granted me the ability to see. 
31|We know that God 
doesn’t pay any regard[d] to sinners; on the other hand, if someone is devout[e] and does 
His will, he’ll give him regard. 
32|From the beginning of time, no one’s ever heard 
that someone granted sight to a person who’d been born blind. 
33|If this fellow 
isn’t from God, he wouldn’t have been able to go about doing any miracles.”
          
34|They took this in and told him, “You were born entirely into various sins, 
and you have the audacity to instruct us?” And they shunned him[f] from religious society.
          
35|Jesus heard that he’d been shunned, hunted him down, and said, “Do 
you believe in the Man[g]?”
          
36|That fellow replied, “And who would that be, sir, so that I may believe in 
him?”
          
37|Jesus said, “Both the one you’ve seen and the one you’re talking to—
that’s him.”
          
38|He said, “I believe, sir!”, and prostrated himself before him.
          
39|Jesus said, “I came into this world to settle a matter[h], so that those who 
can’t see would see and those who do see would become blind.”
          
40|Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to 
him, “We’re not blind too, are we?”

Josh. 7:19; Acts 12:23 to name a couple of instances.
*[c]needs to get his head straightened out…if he’s a wacko or not…Lit: whence he is. An expression; ref. 
note of Luke 13:25.
*[d]pay any regard…Lit: hear
*[e]devout…Lit: God-fearing
*[f]shunned him…Lit: cast him outside. Obviously, from its usage in v. 35, this is an expression. Ref. note of 
John 15:6.
*[g]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[h]to settle a matter…Lit: for a judgment
*[i]sticks to you…Lit: remains. Ref. John 6:56.

*[A]We must continue to work doing the works of He who sent me…Or perhaps: The works of He who sent 
me must continue to be done by us [or among us]. An unusual or incorrect grammatical case for the 
word we causes this verse to be ambiguous. Some ancient manuscripts were modified in an attempt to 
resolve the ambiguity (Textus Receptus replaces we with I, for example).
*[B]until we run out of daylight…Lit: until a day is. The phrase until a day is can also be translated, until the 
day ends. John’s referring to the end of a Jewish day which occurs at sundown. A field worker would 
normally work—say—ten hours, but quit work early enough so there was enough time to walk home in 
the daylight, receive your daily wage (ref. Matt. 20:8), or whatnot. When night arrives, it gets too dark to 
get any work done, etc. He would only work in the field until sunset if he had to, like during harvest, 
when there was too much work and barely enough time to do it. This is what Jesus meant by working 
until there’s no more daylight—there’s way too much to do and not enough time to do it in (i.e. working 
overtime; crunch time). Jesus uses a similar analogy about daylight in John 11:9,10 also.
[C]Go on over to the Siloam (translated ‘Sent’) pool and wash yourself off in it…The likely reason why 
Jesus had him dip in the pool after rubbing the saliva-mud on him is because bodily discharges of any 
and every sort (spittle included) are specified as unclean in the Law of Moses (ref. Lev. 15, the entire 
chapter). Lev. 15:5 states that one should wash himself after being in contact with a bodily discharge of 
any sort; hence Jesus’s instruction for the man to bathe himself. Why Jesus rubbed the saliva-mud on 
the man’s eyes in the first place is anyone’s guess…

41|Jesus told them, “If you were blind, you’d be sinless. But at this moment 
you’re asserting that you can see. Your sin sticks to you[i].”


&JOHN 10
1|”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: the one who’s not 
in the habit of entering through the sheep pen door into the sheep pen but instead has 
another method of entering, namely climbing over the wall[A]—that guy’s a thief, and not 
only a thief but a violent, villainous thug of a thief[B]. 
2|The one who enters the sheep 
pen through the door is the sheep’s shepherd. 
3|This person has doorway access[a], 
and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls the sheep that belong to him by name and 
leads them out. 
4|When he’s driven all the sheep out of the pen, he walks out in front 
of them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. 
5|There’s not even 
the slightest chance that they’ll follow someone else—no, they’ll run away from him, 
since they don’t know the voice of the others who are strangers.” 
6|Jesus told this 
allegory, but those disciples didn’t understand what he was talking about.
          
7|So Jesus spoke again, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really 
am: I am the sheep-door. 
8|All those who came by[C] are violent, villainous thieves—
but no, the sheep didn’t listen to them. 
9|I am the door. If, on a given occasion, 
someone were to enter through me, he’ll be kept from harm, and he will enter and exit 
through the door and find pasture to graze in[D]. 
10|The thief’s sole purpose in coming 
is[b] to steal, kill, and destroy. I came so that you would have life and have it in 
abundance.
          
11|”I am the Awesome Shepherd[E]. The Awesome Shepherd puts his life on 
the line[c] for the sheep. 
12|The hireling, not being a shepherd by trade and whose 
sheep aren’t his own, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away. The 
wolf carries them off and scatters them, 
13|since he’s a hireling and could care less 
about the sheep. 
14|I, however, am the Awesome Shepherd, and I know and 
understand what is mine, and those who are mine know and understand me, 

15|just as the Father knows and understands me and I know and understand the 
Father. And I put my life on the line[c] for the sheep. 
16|I have other sheep which 
don’t frequent this sheep pen compound[F]—and I must lead those sheep. 
17|The 
Father loves me for this reason: I lay my life down[c] so that I may pick it back up 
again[d]. 
18|Nobody takes it away from me; no—I lay my life down of my own 
accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to pick it back up again. I 
received this directive[e] from my Father.”
          
19|Yet again, the Judeans split into factions on account of this message. 

20|The majority said over and over, “He’s demon-possessed and stark-raving mad. 
Why does anyone listen to him?” 
21|Others said over and over, “These aren’t the 
words of a demon-possessed man. Can anyone who’s demon possessed give sight to 
the blind?”
          
22|That was the time of year that Hanukkah occurred in Jerusalem, it being 
late December. 
23|Jesus was in the temple, in the Portico of Solomon, walking 
around. 
24|The Judeans surrounded him and proceeded to say, “How much longer 
are you going to leave us in the dark? We’re dying to know[f]—if you’re the Messiah[g], tell 
us straight up and openly.” 
25|Jesus replied, “I told you and you didn’t believe me. 
The works that I do at the behest of my Father and by His authority[h]—these things 
make a statement[i] about me. 
26|That aside—you, however, don’t believe because 
you’re not from among My Sheep. 
27|My Sheep hear my voice, and I know and 
understand them, and they follow me. 
28|I give them that special fullness of life 
(eternal life), and they’ll never ever perish or come to ruin—not a chance, and no one 
will pry them out my hand. 
29|My Father who has given them to me is greater than 
anyone or anything, and no one can go about prying them out of the Father’s hand. 

30|The Father and I are one.”
          
31|Once again, the Judeans hauled stones over in order to stone him. 

32|Jesus responded to them, “I’ve shown you many works which originated from 
my Father that are awesome. Which one of them are you stoning me for?” 
33|The 
Judeans replied, “We’re not stoning you for a work that is awesome, but for blasphemy, 
and because you being a human being make yourself out to be God.” 
34|Jesus 
replied, “Is it not written in the Old Testament[j] ‘I said you are gods’? 
35|Assuming 
that[k] he told those people—those whom the Word of God appeared to—that they’re 
gods (and no part of the Bible[l] can be edited out[G]), 
36|you’re telling him whom the 
Father commissioned[m] and sent into the world ‘you’re a blasphemer’ because I said 
‘I’m a son of God’? 
37|Now if I don’t do the works of my Father, don’t believe in 
me. 
38|But if I do, and if you happen to not believe in me, believe in the works, in 
order that you would acquire the understanding and continue in the understanding[n] 
that the Father is with me and in me and that I am with and in the Father.” 

39|Thereupon they proceeded to try to seize him, but he escaped from their 
clutches[o].
          
40|He departed once more to beyond the Jordan, to the place where John 
was originally baptizing, and he stayed there a while. 
41|Many came to him, and 
they kept saying, “Sure, John never performed a miracle[p], but everything John said 
about him is true.” 
*[a]This person has doorway access…Lit: the door opens to [i.e., for] him. A personification.
*[b]The thief’s sole purpose in coming is…Lit: The thief doesn’t come except that he would. A figure of 
speech.
*[c]puts his life on the life…I lay my life down…Lit: puts his life…I put my life. This same idiom used in v. 11, 
15, 17, 18 have similar, howbeit different, meanings. It is both the decision to risk one’s one life (v. 11, 
15) and the loss of one’s life as a consequence of such a decision (v. 17, 18).
*[d]pick it back up again…Lit: take it again
*[e]directive…Lit: commandment
*[f]How much longer are you going to leave us in the dark? We’re dying to know…Lit: How much longer 
are you going to take our life away. An hyperbole.
*[g]the Messiah…Lit: the Christ
*[h]at the behest of my Father and of by His authority…Lit: in the name of my Father
*[i]make a statement…Lit: testify or witness
*[j]the Old Testament…Lit: the Law
*[k]assuming that…Lit: if
*[l]the Bible…Lit: the Scripture
*[m]commissioned…Lit: set apart

[present subjunctive]. A figure of speech.
*[o]escaped from their clutches…Lit: exited their hands
*[p]miracle…Lit: sign

*[A]climbing over the wall…Lit: goes up. In ancient Israel, sheepfolds were enclosed with tall, formidable, 
stone walls, higher than the average person. These walls were to not only contain the sheep but to 
prevent predators and thieves from getting in.
*[B]a thief, and not only a thief but a violent, villainous thug of a thief…Lit: a thief and a robber. This is a 
hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11. The two Gk. words here for thief and robber are differentiated in a 
similar fashion to their English renderings. Generally speaking, a thief attempts to avoid confrontation 
when stealing; a robber, on the other hand, assaults the person or persons whom he steals from. A 
robber therefore employs physical harm and violence on a regular basis, and is a much rougher, 
belligerent, and violent criminal than the ordinary thief. In this hendiadys, Jesus explains that this thief is 
not your ordinary thief, but one who commits unwarranted and wanton acts of violence in addition to 
his thievery. When Jesus speaks of the thief in v. 10, the thief he refers to is the same one he describes 
in vv. 1,8. So the thief of v. 10 is a violent destructive thief, not just simply a larcenist.
*[C]came by…Lit: came prior to [or in front of] me. First, in front of me could be rendered prior to me, 
resulting in, came prior to me. Second, the best manuscripts are split fairly evenly on whether the 
phrase in front of me/prior to me is spurious or not. The Gk. phrase pro emou (πρὸ ἐμοῦ) (πρὸ /Strong’s 
4253), (ἐμοῦ/Strong’s 1700) could be rendered in front of me or prior to me (while a face-value reading 
would prefer prior to me, the more sensible rendering would be in front of me). No matter what’s 
chosen, the reader is left scratching his head trying to figure out the point that Jesus through John was 
trying to get across. My guess (and it is very much a guess) is that the phrase is spurious; I have added 
the word by as a weak guess at an interpolation, which leaves unspecified the time which these thieves 
came by.
*[D]he will enter and exit through the door and find pasture to graze in…Lit: he will enter and exit and find 
pasture. Jesus compares himself to a sheep pen door for a couple of verses. The sheep must pass 
through the door to get into the pen and must pass through the door to get out of the pen. While they 
are in the pen, they are kept safe from harm (also v. 9). While they are out of the pen, they can find 
pasture, i.e. eat, drink, etc. The sheep must divide their time between the pen and the pasture; they 
cannot stay in the one or the other for too long a period. Therefore, they are constantly being shuttled 
into and out of the pen, and must pass through the door—and this door is narrow—each time. If they’re 
in the pen for too long, they’ll need to get out; if they’re in the pasture for too long, they’ll need to get 
in. They must pass through the door in order to have their needs met, in summary.
*[E]Awesome Shepherd…The Gk. word behind Awesome is kalōs (καλῶς /Strong’s 2773) and not agathos 
(ἀγαθός/Strong’s 18). Kalos describes something which is beautiful on the outside; in this context, it 
speaks of something which is beautiful because it does what it’s supposed to do so well. Applied to 
being a shepherd, it describes an utra-competent, excellent, diligent, hard-working shepherd, one who 
excels at what a shepherd is supposed to do. A kalos shepherd is one that others, who by viewing his 
actions, confirm that he’s excellent at being a shepherd—to the point of being beautiful—at his job. 
Kalos describes excellence by viewing what’s on the inside of a person, his actions, and does not 
describe (not necessarily) what’s on the inside, the attitudes of the heart, etc. On the other hand, 
Agathos describes someone who’s good on the inside. Choosing to describe Jesus as the Kalos Shepherd 
rather than the Agathos Shepherd doesn’t mean he’s not good on the inside, it simply means that the 
emphasis is on Jesus’s competency as a shepherd.
Furthermore, the term Awesome Shepherd is rendered in English as capitalized because of the use of the 
Gk. attributive adjective here.
*[F]don’t frequent this sheep pen compound…Lit: out of this courtyard. The definition of the Gk. word for 
courtyard is a courtyard enclosed by a house around its perimeter. In this verse, instead of a house, the 
perimeter of the courtyard is the stone wall of the sheep pen; the courtyard is the pen itself. Jesus is 
saying that there are other sheep out there which he owns. The sheep in the pen comprise the nation of 
Israel; those other sheep are the Gentile nations.
[G]edited out…Lit: broken [primary word loosed]; Gk. luo (λύω/Strong’s 3089). The word kataluo 
(καταλύω/Strong’s 2647), derived from luo, is used in Luke 21:6 to describe the destruction of the 
temple by the disassembling of its stones. The temple was comprised of tightly-fitting stones; its 
destruction consisted of tearing these stones apart and casting them aside, completely out of place; the 
use of the word kataluo describes this, with the prefix kata meaning to the ultimate extent. Therefore, a 
meaning of luo is to tear something out of its tightly-fitting location within a larger structure and casting 
it aside. This is what John means by his use of luo in this verse: removing a single verse from the Bible as 
though you were tearing a carefully-placed stone out of larger structure.

42|And many there believed in him.


&JOHN 11
1|There was a certain person who was laid out with an illness, Lazarus of 
Bethany, which is the same town that Mary and her sister Martha were from. 
2|Now 
it was Mary who poured oil over the Lord[a] and wiped his feet with her hair, and it was 
her brother Lazarus who was ill, 
3|so the sisters sent him a message to tell him, “Attn: 
Lord, your good friend is ill.” 
4|Upon hearing this, Jesus said, “The illness you’re 
referring to won’t result in death but instead will be credited to God’s glory, so that the 
Son of God would be glorified because of it.” 
5|Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, 
and Lazarus, 
6|so when he heard that he was ill, he loitered in the area for two more 
days.
          
7|Then, after this, he then says to the disciples, “Let’s go back to Judea.”
          
8|The disciples tell him, “Teacher, at the moment the Judeans are trying to 
stone you to death, and you want to head on back again?”
          
9|Jesus replied, “There’s twelve hours of daylight per day, right? If someone 
walks around during the day, he won’t bump into things, because the objects in this 
world are illuminated by the daylight, and he sees them[A]. 
10|But if someone walks 
around at night, he bumps into things, because nothing’s illuminated.[B]” 
11|He 
said these things and he then tells them next, “Our dear friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; 
in spite of that, I’m going down there to wake him up.”
          
12|So the disciples said, “Lord, if he’s fallen asleep, he’ll be alright.” 

13|Now Jesus had spoken about his death; those disciples, however, thought that he 
was talking about actual sleep. 
14|So then Jesus said to them plainly, “Lazarus is 
dead, 
15|and I’m glad I wasn’t there for your sake, in order that you would believe. 
Enough of that, let’s go to him.” 
16|So Thomas (called “Twin[b]”) said to his fellow 
disciples, “Let’s go so we get to die with him too[C].”
          
17|So Jesus went and found that he’d already been in the tomb for four 
days. 
18|Now Bethany was not too far from Jerusalem, just over 1¾ miles/2.7 km[c]. 

19|Many Judeans had gone to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of 
their brother. 
20|So Martha, as she heard that Jesus was coming, confronted him; 
Mary, meanwhile, was sitting in the house. 
21|So Martha said to Jesus,
      “Lord, had you been here, our brother wouldn’t have died. 
22|But even now 
I know that if you were to ask God for something, God would grant you your request.” 
          
23|Jesus then says, “Your brother will be resurrected.”
          
24|Martha then says, “I know that he’ll come back to life in the Resurrection, 
i.e. the Great Regeneration Event, on the Day of Reckoning[d].”
          
25|Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, 
should he die, he will live, 
26|and all those who are alive and believe in me 
won’t—and I mean WON’T—ever die for eternity. Do you believe this?”
          
27|She then says, “Yes, Lord. I reached the point where I believe that you 
yourself are the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.”
          
28|Having said this, she left and in private called for her sister Mary, “The 
Teacher is here now and is calling for you.” 
29|Right as that woman heard, she 
quickly got herself up and proceeded to go to him. 
30|Jesus hadn’t yet arrived in 
town, but instead was still at the place where Martha met him, 
31|so the Judeans 
who were with her in the house consoling her, seeing that Mary got up in a hurry and 
left, followed her, thinking she was headed out to the tomb in order to weep there. 

32|So Mary, as she went to where Jesus was, saw him, fell at his feet, telling him,
      “Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”
          
33|Thereupon Jesus, as he saw her crying, her and the Judeans who came 
with her, groaned deeply[e] within his spirit and was deeply disturbed.
          
34|He said, “Where have you placed him?”
      They then say, “Lord, come take a look.”
          
35|Jesus wept.
          
36|So the Judeans proceeded to say, “See how close of a friend he 
was?”
37|Some of them said, “Could not this fellow, who granted sight to the blind, 
have done something to prevent him from dying?”
          
38|So Jesus once more groaned deeply[e] within himself and then arrives at 
the tomb. Now there was a cave there, and a stone lying at its entrance. 
39|Jesus 
then says, 
      “Remove the stone.”
      The sister of the deceased, Martha, then says, “Lord, he’ll be reeking by now; it’s 
been four days, you see.”
          
40|Jesus then says, “Did I not tell you that if you were to believe, you would 
see the glory of God?”
          
41|They removed the stone. Jesus lifted his eyes upwards and said, “Father, 
I thank you that You hear me this once. 
42|I have known that You always listen to 
me—that aside, on account of the crowd which is standing around I said, ‘In order they 
might believe that You sent me’.” 
43|Once he said these things, he cried out in a 
loud voice,
      “Lazarus, come out[f]!”
          
44|He who had died exited the tomb, feet bound and hands wrapped, and 
his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus then says, “Loose him and let him go his 
way.”
          
45|Many of the Judeans who went to Mary’s place and witnessed what he 
did believed in him. 
46|Some of them left, went to the Pharisees, and told them 
what Jesus had done. 
47|So the Pharisees and Chief Priests gathered together, 
convened a council, and proceeded to say, “What are we going to do, since this man 
performs so many miracles[g]? 
48|If we let him keep doing this, everyone will 
eventually believe in him, and the Romans will take both the sacred place—the temple—
and the nation of Israel as well away from us. 
49|A certain one of them, someone 
notable, Caiaphas, high priest for that year, told them, “You all don’t know a thing— 

50|you certainly haven’t figured out that it’s beneficial for everyone for one man to 
die on behalf of the people rather than for the entire nation to be destroyed.” 

51|Now he hadn’t said this by his own volition, but rather, being that year’s high 
priest, he prophesied that he was intending for Jesus to die on behalf of the nation, 

52|and not just for the nation alone but in order that the children of God, the 
scattered ones, also be gathered into one. 
53|So from that day on, they began to 
conspire in order to kill him.
          
54|So Jesus no longer went about in public among the Judeans, but departed 
from there instead to an area in the middle of nowhere close to the sea, to a town called 
Ephraim, and remained there with his disciples.
          
55|Now the Jewish Passover was coming up and many from the area went 
down to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to ceremoniously purify themselves. 

56|They kept searching for Jesus, and while standing around in the temple they 
kept saying to one another, “What do you think? Think he won’t come to the festival?” 

*[a]poured oil over the Lord…Lit: anointed the Lord in oil

core meaning, light also means the images of objects as seen by the eye when they are illuminated by a 
light source. This is way it’s used here in vv. 9,10. This is usage also applies, although to a lesser degree, 
to Matt. 6:22,23.
*[B]because nothing’s illuminated…Jesus is referring to the daylight analogy that he spoke about in 9:4,5, 
and assumes the disciples remember the point he made then. His point is that you have to strike while 
the iron is hot. There are just a finite number of instance where God performed spectacular miracles like 
raising Lazarus from the dead, and Jesus had to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that they took place.
[C]Let’s go too so that we get to die with him too…Thomas is being sarcastic, thinking that if they go to 
Bethany, which is near Jerusalem, those who are trying to stone Jesus to death will catch them and have 
them all killed. Thomas sees no sense in risking a visit to a dead man, and it doesn’t occur to him that 
Jesus is going to raise him from the dead.

1|Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, 
whom he, Jesus, raised from the dead, 
2|so they held a dinner for him there; Martha 
was doing the serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones relaxing at the table[a] with him. 

3|Then Mary takes a can’s worth[b] of fragrant ointment[c]—the pure, genuine 
expensive stuff— poured it on his feet, and wiped his feet off with her hair. The house 
was filled with the ointment’s fragrance. 
4|Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one 
who was going to facilitate his arrest, then says, 
5|”Why exactly wasn’t the ointment 
sold for $30,000[d] and the proceeds donated to the poor?” 
6|Now he didn’t make this 
remark about the poor because he gave a hoot about them, but because he was a thief 
and, being in charge of the purse, carried the donations around non-stop. 
7|So Jesus 
said to him, “Let her be, so that she gets to commemorate the day I get embalmed[e]. 

8|The fact is, the poor always have been and always will be amongst you[f], but me 
you won’t always have me around.”
          
9|A huge crowd discovered that he was there in Bethany, and they came by, and 
not just because of Jesus but also so that they could catch a glimpse of Lazarus, whom 
he raised from the dead. 
10|Now the chief priests determined to kill Lazarus too, 

11|because, on account of him, many of the Judeans kept on departing from their 
tutelage and believing in Jesus.
          
12|The next day, the huge crowd which had come to the festival heard that 
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
13|took branches off palm trees, went out to meet 
him, and loudly chanted over and over,

Rescue us[g]!
Blessed is he who comes at the Lord’s behest[h]
The king of Israel, oh yeah!


14|Jesus acquired a not-yet-fully-grown donkey and mounted it, according to 
what’s recorded in Scripture:


15|Don’t be afraid
Fair citizens of that glorious land over the rainbow[A]
Take a look—your king’s coming
Mounted on a donkey colt


16|His disciples didn’t understand this at first, but when Jesus was glorified, they 
then remembered that these things were written in exact reference to him and that these 
things were done for him by them[i].
          
17|So then the crowd that was with him when he summoned Lazarus from 
the tomb and raised him from the dead kept attesting to the miracle’s validity. 

18|This is also the reason that the crowd converged on him: it’s because they heard 
that he had performed this miracle[j]. 
19|So the Pharisees said amongst themselves, 
“As you can see, nothing we’re doing is working out[k]. Take a look—the world’s gone 
chasing after him to be his follower[B].”
          
20|Now some of those who went down to Jerusalem to worship in the 
festival consisted of Greek-speaking Jews[C]. 
21|These people approached Philip of 
Bethsaida, Galilee and asked him, “Sir, we’d like to see Jesus.” 
22|Philip then goes 
and speaks to Andrew, and both go and speak to Jesus. 
23|Jesus’s reply is, “The 
moment when the Man[l] will be glorified is approaching.
          
24|”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am—if a wheat 
seed doesn’t fall on the ground and die, it remains a single wheat seed. But if it were to 
die, it will bring forth a great yield. 
25|He whose soul, whose very life being, 
enjoys[D] this world, this established order of humans, basking in the comradery and 
friendship that he receives from it, destroys it, and he who despises—indeed hates—his 
very life being in this world to the extent of life eternal, which is that special fullness of 
life, guards and protects it, keeping it from harm. 
26|If a given person is to serve 
me, let him follow me, and where I am, the one who serves me will be also. If a given 
person is to serve me, the Father will honor him, including providing his financial 
support[E].
          
27|”At this time my very life being has reached the point where it is quite 
thoroughly troubled—and what should I tell you, Father?—Should I tell You to rescue me 
from this moment in time?—No, on the contrary: it was for this that I arrived at this 
moment in time. 
28|Father, glorify Your reputation and everything You stand 
for[m].” Then a voice from heaven came forth,

Having glorified it already, I will glorify it yet again
—I will do both, not just one or the other

          
29|So then, the crowd which was standing there listening proceeded to say 
that thunder had occurred, but others proceeded to say, “An angel has spoken to him.” 

30|Jesus responded in this manner, “The voice didn’t occur for my benefit, but for 
yours instead. 
31|Now is the moment that a verdict regarding this world, this 
system that the human race lives under, has been reached, and now is the moment that 
the Ruler of This System That the Human Race Lives Under will be given the boot and 
tossed out. 
32|And should I be hoisted up[F] off the ground and killed, I will rally 
everyone to myself.”
          
33|In the course of saying this, he was signifying the sort of death he would 
die, a death lingering over him. 
34|Then the crowd replied, “The Old Testament[n] 
tells us that the Messiah (the Christ) remains here on Earth forever and ever, so how can 
you say that the Man must be hoisted up and killed?” 
35|Jesus told them, “The 
light will remain among you for a little while longer. Walk about (i.e. conduct your 
lives) as though you’re in possession of the light, lest the darkness take you down, 
suppressing you. He who walks about in the darkness doesn’t know where he’s going. 

36|As you’re in possession of the light, believe in the light, so that you become 
embodiments[o] of light.”
      Jesus spoke these things, departed, and concealed himself from them. 

37|Though he performed so many miracles right in front of them, they still 
wouldn’t believe in him, 
38|in order that the quotation from the Prophet Isaiah 
would be fulfilled, in which he said,

Lord, who believed our report?
And to whom has the Lord’s capabilities and actions[p] been revealed?


39|They weren’t able to believe because of what Isaiah said in addition to that,


40|He has blinded their eyes
And hardened their hearts
So that they won’t be able to see with their eyes
And intelligently think things through in the heart
And turn from their ways
And be healed by Me[q]


41|Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke about Him. 

42|Nevertheless, many of the rulers believed in him in spite of what Isaiah 
prophesied, but wouldn’t profess their belief because of the Pharisees, lest they get 
excommunicated. 
43|The fact is, they loved and cherished the pride and joy that 
mankind revels in more than the pride and joy which God revels in.[r]
          
44|Jesus cried out, “He who believes in me doesn’t believe in me per se but 
instead believes in the One who sent me, 
45|and he who beholds me beholds the 
One who sent me. 
46|I—a light in the world—have come so that all who believe in 
me would not remain in the darkness. 
47|If a given person were to hear my 
sayings and not guard over them for the purpose of adhering to them, I don’t render a 
verdict in his case, for I didn’t come in order to render verdicts over the world, all those 
who live according to the system which is over mankind, but instead that I would save 
the world. 
48|He who’s not converted to my point of view and won’t whole-
heartedly embrace[s] my sayings, he has the verdict in himself. The message which I 
spoke: that will render a verdict in his case on that final day when it’s all said and 
done[t]. 
49|Because I didn’t speak from out of my own self, rather the very Father 
who sent me—He personally directed me[u] as to what I would say and how I would 
talk. 
*[a]relaxing at the table…Lit: reclining. Ref. note of Matt. 14:19

it would observe] for [or possibly, unto] the day of my embalming.

poor with yourselves

joy which God revels in…Lit: For they loved [agapaō, ἀγαπάω/Strong’s 25)] the glory of men more than 
the glory of God.
*[s]whole-heartedly embrace…Lit: receive
*[t]on that final day when it’s all said and done…Lit: in the last day
*[u]directed me…Lit: gave me a commandment. Same wording as John 10:18.

*[A]fair citizens of that glorious land over the rainbow…Lit: Zion-daughter. Some liberties taken. The word 
daughter is a synecdoche of all those who belong to Zion, with the implication that the daughters are 
those who love it and never want to depart from it. Zion is the ethereal, uncorrupted land that God 
promises Israel, and not just land but the state of living. It is the fulfillment of His promises; it is the 
elimination of the shortcomings of what is achievable in this life; it is the existence to come for those 
who love and follow God.
*[B]the world’s gone chasing after him to be his follower…Or perhaps: the world’s left to be his disciples, to 
be in subjection to him…Lit: the world’s departed behind him. The expression behind him/go behind him 
is used in Matt. 4:19 to mean be my disciple, and is used in Matt. 16:23 to mean be in subjection to.
*[C]Greek-speaking Jews…Lit: Greeks. Assumed that these are the same people as the diaspora of the 
Greeks referred to in John 7:35. Some, however, argue that these people are God-fearers (ref. Acts 
13:16): Gentiles who adhered to Jewish practices buy hadn’t converted to Judaism per-se. Whether 
Greek-speaking Jews or God-fearers, they are likely one or the other and not Gentiles (the word used 
here could also be rendered Gentiles), since Jews wouldn’t have any interactions with Gentiles, 
especially during a festival.
*[D]enjoys…Gk: phileō (φιλέω/Strong’s 5368). Philos is typically rendered love, but is not to be confused 
with agapā (ἀγάπη/Strong’s 26), which is also rendered love. The philos-kind of love is the love of 
another person, or in this verse of another thing, for the friendship, comradery, and enjoyment that one 
receives from such association; agapā is the love of another because one treasures that other person.
*[E]honor him, including providing his financial support…Lit: honor him. The Gk. word for honor means 
both to honor as the face-value of the word means and to provide financial support. Ref. Matt. 15:3–6, 1 
Tim. 5:17–18.
[F]hoisted up…The Gk. word also means exalted and also means killed. The verse has multiple meanings, 
based on the Gk. word having multiple meanings. On the one hand, Jesus will be hoisted off the ground 
by being put on a cross. Another meaning is that he’ll be killed, just as the same Gk. word is used to 
mean killed in Acts 7:28. On the other hand, Jesus will be exalted, lifted up as a spectacle for everyone to 
see, but afterwards exalted above every name (ref. Phil. 2:9).

&JOHN 13
1|Prior to the Passover festival, Jesus had known that the time had arrived for 
him to depart this world and cross over back to the Father. He loved his own who were 
in the world, this established order of humans—he loved them until the very end. 

2|The devil had already lodged himself in the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot so 
that he would facilitate his arrest, while a dinner was taking place; 
3|Jesus knew that 
the Father had placed all matters under his control[a] and knew that he had previously 
departed from God and now is heading back to God. 
4|Getting up from the dinner 
table, he then takes off his outer garments, took a towel and wrapped it around himself. 

5|He then puts some water in a wash basin and begins to wash the disciples’ feet and 
wipe them dry with the towel which was wrapped around him. 
6|So he comes to 
Simon Peter. He then says to him,
      “Lord, you’re going to wash my feet, now are you?”
          
7|Jesus’s response was, “You won’t understand what I’m doing right now, but 
you’ll figure it out when everything’s all over.”
          
8|Peter then says, “Don’t you ever wash my feet—ever.”
      Jesus answered, “If I don’t get to wash you, you can’t be a part of my inner-
circle[b].”
       
9|Simon Peter then tells him, “Lord, don’t just do my feet but do the hands and 
head too.”
          
10|Jesus then says, “He who’s been bathed doesn’t need anything else to be 
washed except for his feet; apart from that, he’s clean all over. And all of you are 
clean[A]…actually no, not all of you.” 
11|You see, he knew the one who was 
facilitating his arrest; this is the reason he said that not all of you all are clean.
          
12|When he’d finished washing their feet, he put his outer garments back 
on, sat back down at the table[c], and told them, “Do you understand what I’ve done? 

13|You address me as ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak properly, seeing that I 
am Teacher and Lord. 
14|So if I washed your feet—me, your Lord and Teacher—you 
too ought to wash each other’s feet. 
15|You see, I’ve left you an example so that 
you too would act in the same manner as I did. 
16|I’m telling you the honest-to-
goodness truth, I really am: a servant is not superior to his boss, nor is an emissary[d] 
superior to the one who sent him. 
17|If you know these things, you are blessed if 
you would do them. 
18|I’m not talking about all of you. I know I chose some men 
to be my disciples, but that aside, in order for the verse of Scripture to be fulfilled,

“He who dines with me in a fellowship setting[B]
Lifted his heel over top of me to stomp on me

          
19|”I’m telling you right now before it happens, so that you’d have faith 
when it does happen, that I am the One-and-Only-One[e]. 
20|I’m telling you the 
honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: he who receives (i.e. whole-heartedly embraces) 
someone I were to send receives me. He who receives me receives the One Who sent 
me.”
          
21|Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and went on 
record[f] to say, “I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: one of you is 
going to betray me and facilitate my arrest.” 
22|The disciples began looking at one 
another perplexed at what he was talking about. 
23|One of his disciples, whom 
Jesus loved and loved, was seated next to him, and since he was a close companion was 
in physical contact with him, leaning against him[C]. 
24|So Simon Peter nods at this 
fellow to ask whom he might be talking about. 
25|That fellow leaned in closer to 
Jesus, putting his head right next to Jesus’s head[C], and then says to him, “Lord, who is 
it?” 
26|Jesus replied, “The one for whom I ritualistically (signifying friendship) dip a 
small slice[g] of bread in olive oil and give it to—that’s the guy.” So he dipped the slice, 
takes it, and gives it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 
27|Right after giving it to him, 
Satan entered into[D] that guy. Jesus then says to him, “What you’re going to do, get to 
it—quickly now.”
          
28|Now no one who was seated around the table knew to what end he told 
him this. 
29|Truth be known, some of them surmised, “Since Judas is in charge of 
the purse, Jesus is telling him to go buy what we’re missing for the festival or that he 
should donate something to the needy.” 
30|So that guy received the slice of bread 
and departed poste-haste; and it was night.
          
31|So when he had departed, Jesus then says, “At this time the Man[h] has 
been glorified, and God has been glorified in him, 
32|[i] and in him God will glorify 
him, and He will glorify him straightaway. 
33|Fellas[j], I’ll be with you for a little 
while longer. You’ll go looking for me and just like I told the Judeans, ‘Where I’m 
headed, you can’t go’; but now, I’m telling you as well. 
34|I’m giving you a brand-
new directive[k], that you would love one another[E]; in the same manner which I loved 
you, that you too would love each other that way. 
35|This is the means by which 
you’ll be recognized, understood, and known by all, since you are my disciples, if you 
were to have love for one another.”
          
36|Simon Peter then says to him, “Lord, where are you headed?”
      Jesus replied, “Where I’m headed you can’t follow me now, but you’ll follow me 
at some later time.”
          
37|Peter then says, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I’d put my life on the 
line[l] for you.”
          
*[a]placed all matters under his control…Lit: given all things to him into the hands
*[b]can’t be a part of my inner-circle…Lit: you don’t have a portion with me
*[c]sat back down at the table…Lit: reclined
*[d]emissary…Lit: apostle
*[e]I am the One-and-Only-One…Lit: I am…Ref. note of Mark 13:6
*[f]went on record…Lit: testified
*[g]a small slice…Lit: a morsel; a hunk
*[h]the Man…Lit: the Son of Man. Ref. note of Matt 8:20.
*[i]Some of the early manuscripts here insert the phrase, If God has been glorified in him, but the better 
manuscripts do not, so it has been omitted.
*[j]fellas…Or: boys. Lit: children. Similar to usage in John 21:5.
*[k]directive…Also: commandment. Ref. usage in John 10:18.
*[l]put my life on the line…Or: lay my life down. Same phrase used in John 10:11,17.

*[A]clean…The word clean here has two meanings. First, the obvious meaning, the one based on the 
context: physically clean from a bath with water. Second, the word clean here means pure or holy.
*[B]He who dines with me in a fellowship setting …Lit: he who munches on my bread. The eating of bread 
here symbolizes the bond of fellowship and unity between those who partake of it together. This makes 
the Judas’s betrayal all the more wicked.
*[C]One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved and loved, was seated next to him, and since he was a close 
companion was in physical contact with him, leaning against him…Lit: He was reclining, one of his 
disciples, in Jesus’s bosom, whom Jesus was loving. Liberties taken here; also in vv. 12, 25. The disciples 
were reclined, not sitting (ref. note of Luke 16:22). It’s likely that John was propped up on his arm (hand 
on side of head, elbow on the couch); in v. 25 the Gk. text literally says that he fell back [leaned back] at 
Jesus’s bosom. One can deduce that he took away his arm-prop, laid down completely, and leaned back. 
This change in position caused his head to be in contact with Jesus’s bosom, specifically his stomach and 
chest. He leaned back so that his head would be in close proximity to Jesus’s head, so that he could 
speak a few words with him that no one else could hear.
*[D]Satan entered into…Though speculation, it may be that Jesus placed the morsel of bread directly into 
Judas’s mouth, similar to how a bride and a groom put wedding cake into each other’s mouth—a similar 
type of symbolism. It may be that John is implying that, just as the bread was physically placed into 
Judas’s mouth and entered his body, on a parallel level Satan entered Judas’s heart.
[E]I’m giving you a brand-new directive, that you would love one another…Lit: I’m giving you a brand new 
commandment, so that you would love one another. The wording is a figure of speech: instead of stating 
the commandment, the end-result of the commandment is stated instead; the commandment is 
insinuated.

38|Jesus then replies, “You’d put your life on the line for me?—I’m telling 
you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: there’s no way whatsoever that you’ll 
hear a rooster crow until you deny me three times.”


&JOHN 14
1|”Don’t let your heart be troubled: have faith[a] in God and have faith in me. 

2|On my Father’s estate[b] there are many apartments. Now if that were not the case, I 
would’ve told you, because I’m going over there to prepare a place for you. 
3|And if I 
manage to prepare a place for you—and I will[A]—I’ll come back again and collect you 
and keep you by my side[c], so that where I am, you too will be. 
4|And where I’m 
headed, you know the way.”
          
5|Thomas then says to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you’re headed; how 
can we know the way?” 
6|Jesus then says, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No 
one can go to the Father except through me. 
7|If you’ve known and understood me, 
you will know and understand the Father too. Starting now, you know and understand 
Him and have seen Him.” 
8|Philip then says to him, “Lord, show us the Father this 
once, and that’ll be good enough.” 
9|Jesus then says, “I’ve been with you for such a 
long time now, and you haven’t reached the point where you know and understand me, 
Philip? He who’s seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father 
this once’? 
10|You don’t believe that I’m in the Father and the Father is in me, do 
you? The messages that I tell you I don’t speak from myself, but the Father dwelling in 
me does His stuff[d]. 
11|Believe me: I’m in the Father and the Father is in me. If not, 
believe on account of the very works which I do. 
12|I’m telling you the honest-to-
goodness truth, I really am: he who believes in the works that I do—that person will do 
the same—better even[e]—since I’m going to the Father. 
13|And if you happen to ask 
for something in particular while acting in my delegated authority[f], I will do this thing, 
in order that the Father would be glorified by means[g] of the Son. 
14|Let me repeat—
If you were to ask me to do something while acting in my delegated authority[f], I will do 
it[B].
          
15|”If you’re set on loving me[h], you would keep my commandments. 

16|I’ll ask the Father to give you a helper of a different kind[C], one who makes the 
case for you and comforts you, and He will give him so that he would be with you 
forever, 
17|namely the Spirit of Truth, he whom the world, the established order of 
humans, cannot get, since it doesn’t see any indications of him nor knows and 
understands him. You all know him, the Spirit, since he dwells alongside you and will 
be in you— 
18|certainly, I will not have[i] cut you loose and set you on your own as 
orphans—certainly, I am coming to you. 
19|In a little while, the world will no 
longer see me; you see me, however, because I’m alive—and you too will be alive. 

20|In That Day you will know and understand that I am in the Father and you are 
in me and I in you. 
21|He who is in possession of my commandments and keeps 
them—that’s the person who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, 
and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.”
          
22|Judas (not Iscariot) then says to him, “Lord, how has it turned out that 
you intend to manifest yourself to us and not to the world?” 
23|Jesus thought it 
over and said, “If someone were to love me, he will keep my system of thought, and my 
Father will love him, and we will come to him and form and share an apartment with 
him. 
24|He who doesn’t love me won’t keep my system of thought. And the 
system of thought you hear didn’t originate from me but instead is from the Father who 
sent me.
          
25|”I have spoken these things to you while I’m still among you. 

26|Now the Helper, the Holy Spirit, he whom the Father will send upon my 
authorization[f], that person will teach you everything and remind you and cause you to 
recall all that I’ve said to you. 
27|I leave you peace—I give you My Peace; not in 
the same manner that the world, the established order of humans, gives you. Don’t let 
your heart be troubled[j] nor cower in fear. 
28|You heard that I told you, ‘I’m 
heading out and will come to you.’ If you were consumed with loving me, you would 
rejoice over this event, because I’m going to the Father, since the Father is greater than 
me. 
29|I have spoken to you at this moment in time before it happens, so that when 
it happens you will have faith and believe. 
30|I don’t have a lot to talk to you about 
any longer; the fact is, the Ruler of the World (the System Which Dominates the Human 
Race System) is coming—and he can accuse me of nothing, tempt me with nothing, nor 
intimidate me in any way[k]. 
*[a]have faith…Also: believe; trust
*[b]on my Father’s estate…Also: in my Father’s house
*[c]collect you and keep you by my side…Lit: receive you to myself
*[d]does His stuff…Lit: does His works
*[e]that person will do the same—better even…Lit: that [person] will do and greater than these will do.
*[f]acting in my delegated authority…upon my authorization…Lit: in my name

faced with a choice of doing something or not doing it.
*[i]I will not have…Lit: I will not [Gk. ou (οὐ/Strong’s 3756 )]. The Gk. word ou is unexpected, whereas the 
word ma is expected here, skewing the meaning.
*[j]don’t let your heart be troubled…The same exact wording as used in v. 1.
*[k]he can accuse me of nothing, tempt me with nothing, or intimidate me in any way…Lit: he has nothing 
in me

*[A]And if I manage to prepare a place for you—and I will…Lit: If I were to prepare a place for you. The 
tentativeness of the subjunctive verb tense used in the GT is a figure of speech. But what is actually 
meant is arduousness. In order for Jesus to prepare a place, he must first endure the cross, and only 
then afterwards, being resurrected and ascending to the Father, can he prepare a place. He having to go 
to the cross is not tentative but arduous; hence the figure of speech. 
*[B]Let me repeat—If you were to ask me to do something while acting in my delegated authority, I will do 
it…Lit: If you were to ask me something in my name, I will do. Obvious to the reader of the GT, v. 14 is a 
repetition of v. 13a. The difference between the wording in these two verses is that v. 13 is a more 
compact repetition, omitting a few words with the confidence that the reader will understand that they 
were omitted for brevity. Therefore, the repetition of the statement is a figure of speech, one where 
Jesus wants to be clear about what he’s saying and to emphasize it.
[C]I’ll ask the Father to give you a helper of a different kind…Lit: I’ll ask the Father [to give you another 
helper] and He will give you another helper. The Gk. text omits the phrase to give you another helper, 
with the wording shortened to I’ll ask the Father and He will give you another helper. This short form is a 
figure of speech.

&JOHN 15
1|”I am the True Grape Vine, and my Father is the gardener. 
2|He removes all 
branches that are attached to me that don’t produce[A] any grapes[a], but He prunes all 
branches which produce grapes and trims off their dead growth so that they’ll produce 
more. 
3|You’ve been pruned and trimmed already on account of the system of 
thought[b] I’ve communicated to you. 
4|Stay attached to[c] me and make sure I am 
attached to you. Just as a branch can’t produce fruit on its own, except if it stays attached 
to the vine, in the same way you can’t either except if you stay attached to me. 
5|I’m 
the vine, you’re the branch[d]. He who stays attached to me and I to him produces a lot 
of fruit, since apart from me you can’t do a thing. 
6|If a given person were to not stay 
attached to me, he’ll be like the branch that was discarded[B] and dried out: they gather 
such branches together and toss them into the refuse fire, and the fire burns and burns. 

7|If you would stay attached[c] to me and my sayings to you, if you so-happened to 
want something, you’ll ask for it, making the request once[e], and it’ll be given to you. 

8|My Father was glorified to see to it that you continuously yield a lot of fruit and that 
you would achieve the status of being my disciples.[f]
          
9|”In the same way that the Father loved me, I love you too: dwell in My Love. 

10|If you were to, on the whole[g], keep my commandments, dwell in my love on 
the whole[g], just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and dwell in His love.
          
11|”I’ve spoken these things to you so that My Joy would be in you and that 
your joy would be realized to the fullest extent. 
12|My Commandment is this: that 
you love in the same way that I loved you. 
13|No one has a greater love than this, 
that he would put his life on the line[h] on behalf of his close friends. 
14|You all are 
my close friends if you do what I command you to do by way of commandment. 

15|No longer do I say that you are compulsory servants, since the run-of-the-mill 
servant doesn’t know what his master goes about doing, but I’ve put out the statement 
that you all are friends, because I’ve made known to you what I’ve heard from my 
Father and made you understand it. 
16|You have not chosen me, but rather I have 
chosen you and set you up[i] so that you would go your own way and yield fruit and 
that your fruit would endure; that that particular thing which you were to ask the 
Father for while acting in my delegated authority[j], I would give to you. 
17|These 
things I command you to do, in order that you would love one another.
          
18|”If the world, the established order of humans, hates you, understand 
that, first and foremost, it has come to hate me. 
19|If you were a part of[k] this 
world-system, as you went along for the ride the world would have been cordially 
befriending its own, but since you’re not a part of this world-system, since instead I 
chose you thereby taking you out of the system—because of this the world hates you. 

20|Remember the saying I told you, ‘A servant isn’t greater than his master’?—If 
they persecuted me, they’ll persecute you all too. If they followed my message, they’ll 
follow yours also.
          
21|”Anyways, they will do all these things to you on account of my 
reputation and the authority I’ve delegated to you[l], since they don’t know the One who 
sent me. 
22|Had I not come and spoken to them, they would not be in sin[m]. But at 
this time they don’t have an excuse in regard to their sin. 
23|He who hates me 
hates my Father too. 
24|If I had not done the miraculous works among them that no 
one else ever did, they wouldn’t be in sin[m][C]. But now they have had the chance to see 
and observe all that I’ve done and have come to hate both me and my Father. 

25|That aside, that the verse from their sacred book[n] be fulfilled, ‘They 
gratuitously hated me.’
          
26|”When the Helper[o] does come, whom I will sent to you from the Father, 
the Spirit of Truth, the one who proceeds forth[p] from the Father, that person will 
declare things about me for the record. 
*[a]grapes…Lit: fruit
*[b]system of thought…Lit: the word. Same thing spoken in John 14:23,24.
*[c]stay attached to…Lit: remain or dwell
*[d]you’re the branch…Lit: you all are the branches. The gospel writers frequently use plurals forms when 
we in English would render the equivalent using the singular.
*[e]making the request once…This interpolation reflects the verb tense of the word ask in this verse.
*[f]My Father was glorified to see to it that you continuously yield a lot of fruit and that you would achieve 
the status of being my disciples…Lit: In this my Father was glorified, so that you would [over and over 
again] bear much fruit and [in a single leap] become my disciples.
*[g]on the whole…the Gk. verb tense for the word keep insinuates keeping the commandments viewed in 
its entirety.
*[h]put his life on the line…Or: lay his life down. Ref. note of John 10:11.
*[i]set you up…Or: positioned
*[j]while acting in my delegated authority…Lit: in my name
*[k]a part of…Lit: out of
*[l]reputation and the authority I’ve delegated to you…Lit: my name
*[m]be in sin…Lit: have sin
*[n]sacred book…Lit: Law [of Moses]
*[o]Helper…Also: Advocate, Comforter, Intercessor. Same word used in John 14:16. The Gk. word refers to 
someone who, nowadays, fills the role of an attorney.
*[p]proceeds forth…Lit: goes out

*[A]He removes all branches that are attached to me that don’t produce…The meaning of this remark 
should be understood in light of what Jesus said in Matt. 3:10, 7:19, and also later in John 15:6; in other 
words, branches that don’t produce fruit are unbelievers: those who are presented with Jesus’s message 
but refuse to believe. It is not the believer who makes mistake after mistake.
*[B]discarded…Lit: thrown outside. This expression (the keyword in the expression being outside) appears 
in Matt. 5:13, 13:48, 21:39; Mark 4:11, 12:8; Luke 14:35, 20:15; John 6:37, 9:34 (and perhaps more) and 
has the consistent meaning of categorically rejected in all these occurrences.
[C]If I had not done the miraculous works among them that no one else ever did, they wouldn’t be in 
sin…This is consistent with what’s found in Mark 3:29, namely blaspheming the Holy Spirit. The rejection 
of an irrefutable display of God’s miraculous power is a deep sin.

&JOHN 16
1|”I’ve spoken these things to you so that you don’t wind up doing the wrong 
thing[a]. 
2|They’ll shun you and excommunicate you. No—even worse[b]—there’s 
coming a time that everyone who kills you will be proud of the fact—will exult—that 
they’re doing God a favor, as though they’re bringing an offering to the temple and 
presenting it to Him. 
3|They’ll do these things because they didn’t know, recognize, 
and understand neither the Father nor me. 
4|Anyways, I’ve spoken these things to 
you so that when the time does come you’ll remember that I told you.
      “Now, I didn’t tell you these things from day-one, because I was with you all. 

5|But the time has come for me to head back to the One who sent me, and not a one of 
you asks me, ‘Where are you headed?’ 
6|No—because I’ve told you these things, the 
pain and grief of it all has filled your heart.
          
7|”But that aside, I’m telling you the truth: it’s more beneficial for you that I 
depart. For if were to not depart, the Helper won’t come to you. But if I do in fact 
depart[c], I’ll send him to you. 
8|That person will come and expose to the world (the 
established order of humans) the things concerning the nature of any and all sins, 
exposing them for what they are and convicting the world of them; and the things 
concerning acting the right way and doing the right things[d]; and the things concerning 
verdicts rendered in judgment. 
9|To start off with, concerning sin, because they refuse 
to believe in me. 
10|And concerning acting the right way and doing the right 
things, because I’m headed to the Father and you’ll no longer watch me or behold me. 

11|And concerning verdicts, because a verdict has been issued against the Ruler of 
this World System.
          
12|”There’s still a lot more that I have to tell you again and again, but—no—
you can’t handle it[e] just now. 
13|But when that person comes—the Spirit of 
Truth—he’ll guide you in the truth, in all of it. The fact of the matter is, he won’t speak 
from himself, but rather he’ll speak that which he’ll hear, and he’ll report to you what’s 
coming. 
14|That person will glorify me, because he’ll take from what is mine and 
report it to you. 
15|All things that the Father has are mine; this is the reason I said 
that he’ll take from what is mine and report it to you. 
16|In a bit you’ll no longer be 
able to look at me, and a bit after that you’ll see me.”
          
17|So various disciples of his said to one another, “What’s this he’s telling 
us, ’In a bit you’ll no longer be able to look at me, and a bit after that you’ll see me,’ and, 
that ‘I’m headed to the Father’?” 
18|They kept on saying, “What’s this ‘in a bit’?—
We don’t know what he’s talking about.” 
19|Jesus understood that they were 
wanting to ask him about it, and he said, “Is this the reason you’re inquiring of one 
another, because I said, ’In a bit you’ll no longer be able to look at me, and a bit after 
that you’ll see me’? 
20|I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am, 
you will weep and mourn, but the world, the established order of humans, will break 
out in joy. You’ll be in pain, but your pain will turn into joy. 
21|When a woman 
gives birth, she experiences pain, since her due-date has arrived, but once she gives 
birth to a child, she no longer remembers the suffering on account of the joy, since she’s 
brought a human being into the world. 
22|So—yes—you too are experiencing pain. 
But I’ll see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take the joy away 
from you. 
23|When that day arrives[f], you won’t ask me for anything. I’m telling 
you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: that particular thing that you would ask 
the Father for while acting in my delegated authority[g], He will give to you. 
24|Up 
to this point, you haven’t asked for anything while acting in my delegated authority[g]. 
Ask and you’ll receive, so that your joy would be fulfilled.
          
25|”I’ve spoken these things to you plainly, without wrapping them in 
analogies; there’s coming a time when I’ll no longer speak to you in analogies but will 
inform you plainly about the Father. 
26|When that day arrives[f], while acting in 
my delegated authority[g] you’ll ask for something, and I’m not going to tell you that I’ll 
personally ask the Father for this thing regarding you; 
27|you see, the Father 
Himself extends his close friendship to you all, since you all have closely befriended me 
and have believed that I came from God. 
28|I came from the Father, and I have 
come into the world, the established order of humans. I’m leaving the world, letting 
them go their own way, and am going to the Father.”
          
29|His disciples then say, “Hey, you’re speaking plainly now, not explaining 
things by way of analogy. 
30|At this time we know that you know everything, and 
there’s no need[h] for anyone to ask you the meaning of any analogy. This is the reason we 
believe that you came from God.” 
31|Jesus replied, “Now you believe? 

32|Look here—the time’s coming, and in fact has arrived, that each one of you will 
be dispersed, retreating to his home town. You’ll leave me by myself. But I’m not alone, 
since the Father is with me. 
*[a]wind up doing the wrong thing…Lit: do wrong by me; fall apart; sin; stumble. Ref. note of Matt. 11:6.
*[b]no—even worse…Lit: never mind that [and consider this]; put that aside [and take this in]; and that’s 
nothing. A figure of speech of a sort, to forget about the previous remark because the next one is so 
much more severe.
*[c]if I do in fact depart…Lit: if I were to depart
*[d]acting the right way and doing the right things…Also: righteousness
*[e]handle it…Lit: bear it; endure it
*[f]when that day arrives…Lit: in that day
*[g]while acting in my delegated authority…Lit: in my name
*[h]there’s no need…Lit: you have no need. The you is used like one, like one has no need.

[A]be brave now…Lit: courage. A short remark; same one rendered brace yourself in Mark 10:49. This 
same remark used to be used in English but has dropped out of usage. In Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs, Doc tells the other dwarfs, Courage, men, courage!, before they scrub themselves with soap and 
water.

1|Jesus said these things then lifted his eyes up to the sky, to where heaven is, 
and said, “Father, my time has arrived. Glorify Your son this once, so that the son 
would glorify You, 
2|just as You’ve given him authority over every imaginable 
being[a], so that he would give that special fullness of life, eternal life, to all those who’ve 
been given to him. 
3|Eternal life is this: that they would know and understand You, 
the Only True God and Jesus Christ the Messiah whom You sent. 
4|I have glorified 
You upon the earth, having completed the works You’ve given me to do. 
5|At this 
juncture in time, glorify me this once, Father, using your inherent glory, the glory which 
came from you, the glory which you ever had before the world came into being.
          
6|”I’ve made Your reputation and everything you stand for[b] manifest to the 
people You’ve given to me from among those in the world. They were with You, and 
You gave them to me, and they have kept Your system of thought[c]. 
7|By now they’ve 
come to understand that everything You’ve given me is from You; 
8|that the sayings 
which You gave me, I’ve given to them. They whole-heartedly took it all in[d] and have 
come to know and understand the truth that went forth from You, and have believed 
that You sent me. 
9|I ask in matters concerning them; I don’t ask in matters concerning 
the world, the established order of humans, but rather concerning those whom You’ve 
given me, because they are with You. 
10|All that is mine is Yours, and Yours mine, 
and I have been glorified in them. 
11|No longer am I to stay in the world (but they 
are in the world), but I’m heading Your way. Holy Father, hold them fast this once, they 
whom You’ve given me, in everything You stand for[b], so that they would be in unity[e] 
the same way we are. 
12|When I was with them, I never ceased to hold they whom 
You’ve given me fast in everything that You stand for[b], and I was on the lookout and 
guarded them, and not a single one of them perished except the one who had self-
destruction written all over him[f], so that the Scriptures be fulfilled.
          
13|”But at this time I’m heading Your way, and while still in the world I 
speak these things so that they might have My Fulfilled Joy within them. 
14|I have 
given them Your system of thought[c], and the world (the established order of humans) 
hated them, because they are not part of[g] the world in the same way that I am not part 
of the world. 
15|I’m not asking that You remove them from the world, but that You 
keep them from the Evil One[h] instead. 
16|They are not a part of[g] the world in the 
same way that I am not part of the world. 
17|Partition them off this once, 
separating them in the truth: Your system of thought[c] is truth. 
18|In the same way 
that you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world. 
19|And on their 
behalf, I separate myself and keep myself holy, in order that they too would be 
partitioned and separated in truth.
          
20|”I don’t ask this request only, but I also ask concerning those who believe 
in me by way of their discourse, 
21|so that everyone would be in unity[e], just as 
You, Father, are united with me, and I am united with You; so that they would be 
united in us, in order that the world would believe that You sent me. 
22|And I 
have given to them the glory which You have given me, so that they would be unified 
in the same way we are unified, 
23|I in them and You in me, so that they would be 
made complete in unity, so that the world would know and understand that You sent 
me and that You loved them in the same way that You loved me.

whom You’ve given me—I want those people to be at the same place I’m at too, in 
order for them to behold My Glory, the glory which You’ve given to me because You 
loved me before time even began[i].

&JOHN 18
1|After saying these things, Jesus, together with his disciples, departed to the 
other side of Kidron Creek, to where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples 
entered. 
2|Judas, the one who’ll facilitate his arrest, was familiar with the place, since 
Jesus and his disciples had gathered there often, 
3|so Judas took the platoon of 
soldiers tasked with making the arrest and some of the high priests’ and Pharisees’ 
attendants and gets there with lamps, torches, and weapons. 
4|Jesus, knowing 
everything that was about to befall him, left the garden and then says to them,
      “Whom are you looking for?”
          
5|They replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
      He then says, “I am he whom you’re looking for, the One-and-Only-One[a].”
      His betrayer Judas stood there among them.
          
6|As he said, “I am,” they thereupon retreated backwards and fell on the 
ground[A]. 
7|So again he asked them,
      “Whom are you looking for?”
      So they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
          
8|Jesus answered, “I told you that it’s me[b]. So if I’m the one you’re looking for, 
let the others go their own way.” 
9|He said that in order that the remark, “not a single 
one of them perished[c],” would be fulfilled.
          
10|Simon Peter, in possession of a sword, hauled it out and struck the Chief 
Priest’s slave, slicing off his right ear (the name of the slave was Malchus). 
11|So 
Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back in its place—shall I not go through with what 
the Father’s assigned me to do[d]?”
          
12|So the platoon, the captain, and the Judean attendants arrested Jesus and 
tied him up. 
13|They went over to Annas first, as, you see, he was Caiaphas’s 
father-in-law, who was High Priest that year. 
14|Now it was Caiaphas who was the 
one who advised the Judeans that it’s beneficial that one person die on behalf of the folk 
people.
          
15|Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the Chief Priest’s 
staff[B] was familiar with that disciple, and he entered into the Chief Priest’s courtyard 
together with Jesus. 
16|But Peter stood outside at the doorway. So the other 
disciple, the one whom the Chief Priest’s staff was familiar with, spoke to the doorman 
and he let Peter in. 
17|The doorman’s girl-servant said to Peter,
      “Aren’t you one of this man’s disciples too?”
      That fellow said, “No I’m not.”
          
18|Now the servants and attendants made a charcoal fire and were standing 
there keeping warm. It was cold, you see. Peter was standing there with them keeping 
warm too.
          
19|The Chief Priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 

20|Jesus answered, “I have spoken to the world publicly and in the open. I taught 
in synagogues and in the temple, where every Judean assembles, all the time and have 
said nothing that was not disclosed to the public. 
21|Why are you asking me? Go 
ask the audience what I spoke to them. Check it out yourself—those folks know what I 
told them.”
          
22|After he said these things, one of the attendants who was standing there 
slapped Jesus in the face and said, “Is this any way to address the High Priest?” 

23|Jesus replied, “If I’ve said something that’s wrong[e], for the record specify what 
I said that was wrong. But if what I’ve said is correct[e], why are you hitting me?” 

24|Annas sent him tied up to the High Priest Caiaphas.
          
25|Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm. They said to him, 
“You’re one of his disciples too, aren’t you?” That guy put out a denial and said, “No 
I’m not.” 
26|One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one Peter cut the ear 
off, then says, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?” 
27|Again Peter denied it, 
and without delay a rooster crowed.
          
28|They took Jesus away, taking him from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace 
complex. Now it was early morning the next day, and they didn’t enter the palace 
complex, so that they wouldn’t be defiled by having contact with Gentiles but instead 
could partake of the Passover meal. 
29|So Pilate left the complex and went outside to 
them, and they conversed:
      “What charge do you bring against this man?”
          
30|Mustering a response, they told him, “If this guy hadn’t done anything 
wrong, we wouldn’t have brought him to you.”
          
31|So Pilate told them, “Take him and prosecute him according to your code 
of law.”
      The Judeans told him, “It’s forbidden for us to sentence anyone to death.” 

32|The transferring of the sentencing to the Romans happened in order that Jesus’s 
statement which he made be fulfilled, in which he indicated what kind of death he was 
going to die. 
33|So Pilate went back into the complex, called for Jesus, and told 
him,
      “Are you the king of the Jews?”
          
34|Jesus replied, “Are you saying this of your own accord or repeating what 
others told you about me?”
          
35|Pilate replied, “I’m not a Jew, now, am I? Your own people and the high 
priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?”
          
36|Jesus answered, “My Kingdom is not of this world. Had My Kingdom 
been of this world, my entourage would have put up a fight so that I wouldn’t have 
been taken into custody by the Judeans. But at the present time My Kingdom is not over 
the place we’re at now.”
          
37|So Pilate said to him, “So you’re not a king?”
      Jesus replied, “Whatever you say[f]—I’m a king. I have been born[g] and came into 
the world, the established order of humans, for this reason: that I would go on record 
and speak using the truth. All who exist as part of[h] the truth hear my voice.”
          
38|Pilate then says, “What is truth?”
      After saying this, he once again left the complex to go to the Judeans and then tells 
them, “I find nothing to charge him with. 
39|Now, by custom I free one person on 
the Passover, handing him back over to you. So have you decided that I should free the 
King of the Jews?”

revelation of the holiness of God, caused the mob to fall to the ground.

40|They yelled out again and again, “Not this guy—Barabbas 
instead!” (Barabbas was a thug).


&JOHN 19
1|Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped, 
2|plus the soldiers weaved a 
crown out of thorns and placed it on his head and clothed him in clothing one finds on 
a nobleman[a]. 
3|They proceeded to go up to him and say again and again, “Pleased to 
meet you[b], King of the Jews,” and slap him. 
4|Once more Pilate left the complex and 
then says to them, “Hey, I’m taking him outside, removing him from the complex, so that 
you understand that I haven’t found anything to charge him with.” 
5|Jesus came out 
wearing the crown of thorns and the nobleman’s clothing. He then tells them, “Here he 
is[c]—the man of the hour.” 
6|When the chief priests and their attendants saw him, they 
yelled out,
      “Crucify! Crucify!”
      Pilate then says, “Take him and crucify him yourselves; the fact is, I haven’t 
found anything to charge him with.”
          
7|The Judeans answered, “We have a code of law, and according to this code 
he has to die, since he made himself out to be a son of God.”
          
8|So when Pilate heard this remark, he feared all the more, 
9|reentered the 
complex, and then says to Jesus, “Are you out of your mind[d]?”
      Jesus didn’t reply.
          
10|Pilate then says, “You won’t talk to me? Don’t you know that I have the 
authority to acquit you or the authority to crucify you?”
          
11|Jesus replied, “You don’t have any authority at all over me except that 
which was given to you from above. Because of this, the one who betrayed me and 
facilitated my arrest, handing me into your custody, has a worse sin.” 
12|As a 
result of this, Pilate proceeded to try to find a way to release him.
      The Judeans yelled out, “If you set this guy free, you’re not Caesar’s friend. 
Everything ‘the king’ himself has done is in defiance to Caesar.”
          
13|Pilate heard these words, brought Jesus out, and seated himself upon the 
judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement (which is Gabbatha in Aramaic). 

14|Now it was around noon on the preparation day which occurs on the day before 
the Passover. He then says to the Judeans,
      “Here he is[c]—your king.”
          
15|Those people yelled out, “Away! Away! Crucify him!”
      Pilate then says, “Shall I crucify your king?”
      The chief priests replied, “Apart from Caesar we have no king,”
          
16|So he then handed him over to be crucified.
      They laid hold of Jesus 
17|and, lugging his own cross, departed for 
something called Skull Place (which in Aramaic is Golgotha), 
18|where they 
crucified him, and two others with him, one here and one there, with Jesus in the 
middle. 
19|In addition, Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross; on it was 
written, “Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.” 
20|It was written in Aramaic, 
Latin, and Greek, so that many of the Judeans who were near the city where Jesus was 
crucified could read what was written on it. 
21|The Judean chief priests proceeded 
to tell Pilate, “Don’t write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but instead write, ‘This guy said, “I’m 
the king of the Jews.”’” 
22|Pilate replied, “What I’ve written, I’ve written.”
          
23|When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothing, divided them 
into four parts, one part for each soldier, and they divided up the undergarment[e]. Now 
the undergarment was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down, 
24|so they 
said to one another, “Let’s not rip it into pieces, but we’ll play a game of chance for it 
instead and one person will win it,” in order that the verse of Scripture be fulfilled:

They divvied up my outer garments among themselves
And they tossed dice[f] for my inner garment

So—yes—the soldiers did this.
          
25|Now Jesus’s mother stood there next to Jesus’s cross; so did his mother’s 
sister, as well as Mary wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. 
26|So Jesus, seeing his 
mother and the disciple whom he loved standing next to her, close at hand, available 
should she need anything, then says to his mother, “Lady, take a look at your new son.” 

27|Then he said to the disciple, “Take a look at your new mother.” And from that 
time onwards, the disciple took her into his household as one of his own.
          
28|After these things happened, Jesus saw that everything had already 
arrived at the finishing point. In order to fulfill the Scriptures, he then says, “I’m 
thirsty.” 
29|A container full of wine was lying there, so a sponge-full of wine was 
put on a stick and put to his mouth. 
30|When he took the wine, Jesus said, “It’s 
finished,” leaned his head to one side and passed away[g].
          
31|Since it was the day of preparation for the Passover, the Judeans asked 
Pilate if they could break their bones into tiny pieces and take them away, so that the 
bodies wouldn’t remain on the crosses on the Sabbath, since that Sabbath was a high 
day, being the Passover. 
32|So the soldiers came and fragmented the bones of the 
first man and the bones of the other man, those crucified with him. 
33|But when 
they came for Jesus, as they saw that he’d already died, they didn’t fragment his bones; 

34|instead one of the solders pierced the side of his rib cage with a spear, and 
blood and water came out right away. 
35|One person who had seen this went on 
record to verify that this did actually happen[h], and his testimony is trustworthy, and that 
fellow knows that he’s telling the truth, so that you all too would believe that this 
happened. 
36|In fact, these things happened so that the verse of Scripture would be 
fulfilled, “Not a single one of his bones will be broken,” 
37|and not only that but 
another verse which says, “They will look at the one they pierced.”
          
38|After these things happened, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus who 
but for fear of the Judeans concealed the fact, asked Pilate if he could take Jesus’s body 
away, and Pilate permitted it. 
39|And Nicodemus—he who came to him at night—
came too bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 75 lbs. (33 kg.)[A]. 
40|So they 
took Jesus’s body and wrapped it in fine linen with the aromas, according to the Jewish 
burial custom.
          
41|Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the 
garden was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. 
*[a]clothing one finds on a nobleman…Lit: purple. Ref. note of Mark 15:17.
*[b]pleased to meet you…Ref. note of Mark 15:18

42|So on account of 
the Jewish day of preparation and because the tomb was nearby, they then put Jesus in 
it.


&JOHN 20
1|Now on Sunday[a], while still dark, Mary Magdalene comes early to the tomb 
and sees that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. 
2|So she runs and comes 
to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus had, throughout, a close friendship 
with and tells them, “They took the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they 
put him.”
          
3|So Peter and the other disciple left and started towards the tomb. 
4|The 
two were running neck-and-neck, but the other disciple got out ahead of Peter and 
arrived at the tomb first, 
5|peered in, and sees that the linen cloth lying there, but he 
didn’t enter, however. 
6|Right behind him, Simon Peter arrives too and entered the 
tomb and sees the linen cloth lying there 
7|along with the face cloth, which was on his 
head, and which was not lying with the linen cloth but was folded up separately instead 
and was in its own[b] spot. 
8|Then the other disciple, the one who arrived at the tomb 
first, entered, saw what there was to see, and believed; 
9|the fact is, they still had not 
acquired an experience-based understanding of the verse of Scripture which says that he 
must arise from the dead. 
10|So they left once more to go to the other disciples.
          
11|Now Mary stood crying just outside the tomb. As she cried and cried, 
she peered into the tomb 
12|and beholds two angels in white sitting there where 
Jesus’s body was lying, one at his head and one at his feet. 
13|Those angels tell her,
      “Lady, why are you crying?”
      She then says, “They took my Lord away and I don’t know where they put him.” 

14|After saying these words, she turned around and then sees Jesus standing there, 
but didn’t know that it was Jesus.
          
15|Jesus then tells her, “Lady, why are you crying? Whom are you looking 
for?”
      That woman thought that he was the gardener and tells him, “Sir, if you hauled 
him off, tell me where you put him, and I’ll take him away.”
          
16|Jesus then says, “Mary!”
      That woman turned to him and says in Aramaic, “Rabbi!” (i.e. “Teacher”). 
          
17|Jesus then says to her, “Don’t touch me; you see, I have not ascended to 
the Father yet. Now, go to my comrades[c] and tell them, ‘I’m ascending to my Father 
and your Father and to my God your God.’” 
18|Mary Magdalene goes and 
announces to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he told her these things.
          
19|While it was early that Sunday, and while the doors where the disciples 
were at had been shut tight due to the fear of the Judeans, Jesus came and stood in their 
midst and tells them, “Peace be with you.” 
20|After saying this, he showed them 
his hands and the side of his rib cage. So the disciples rejoiced, seeing the Lord. 

21|Jesus told them once more, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father sent me, I too 
send you.” 
22|After saying this, he breathed on them and tells them, “Receive the 
Holy Spirit. 
23|If you were to forgive multiple-someones’ sins, they’ll be forgiven 
with respect to them; if you were to not forgive their sins, the sins stay put.”
          
24|Now Thomas (i.e. Twin[d]), one of the Twelve, wasn’t with them when 
Jesus came by. 
25|So the other disciples proceeded to tell him, “We have seen the 
Lord.” But he told them, “If I don’t get to see the nail holes in his hands and poke my 
finger into the holes and reach my hand into his rib cage, there’s no way I’m going to 
believe it.”
          
26|Eight days later his disciples once again were gathered inside, and 
Thomas was with them this time. While the doors were shut tight, Jesus then comes, 
stood in their midst, and says, “Peace be with you.” 
27|Then he tells Thomas, 
“Bring[e] your finger here and take a look at my hands and bring[e] your hand here and 
reach into my rib cage, and don’t turn out to be someone who refuses to believe[f] but 
turn out to be someone who believes[f] instead.” 
28|In response to it all, Thomas said 
to him, “My Lord and my God.” 
29|Jesus then tells him, “Because you’ve given me 
a good looking-over, you’ve reached the point where you believe? Blessed are those 
who haven’t seen and make the decision to believe.”
          
30|So, yes, Jesus performed many miracles[g] and a variety of them in front 
of his disciples, ones that aren’t recorded in this book of the Bible[A]. 
*[a]Sunday…Lit: the first [day] of the Sabbaths [week]. The NT in various places refers to days of the week

31|But these 
miracles have been recorded so that you all would acquire faith that Jesus is the 
Messiah—the Christ—the Son of God, and so that, while faith is being acquired, you 
would have that special life through the authority vested in him[h].


&JOHN 21
1|After these things Jesus manifested himself once more to the disciples at the 
Sea of Tiberias. Now this is the way he made his appearance: 
2|Simon Peter; Thomas 
(i.e. “Twin”); Nathanael, who was from Cana, Galilee; the sons of Zebedee; and two of 
his other disciples were together. 
3|Simon Peter then tells them, “I’m going fishing.” 
They then say, “We’re coming with you.” They left, boarded the boat they used for 
fishing, and caught nothing that night.
          
4|Now it had already become early morning. Jesus stood on the shore; the 
disciples however didn’t know it was him. 
5|So Jesus says, “Boys[A], you don’t have 
anything that’s edible—namely fish[B]—now do you?” They replied, “No.” 
6|So he said, 
“Cast the net over the starboard side of the boat, and you’ll get some.” So they cast the 
net and could barely haul it in due to the huge number of fish. 
7|That disciple whom 
Jesus loved and loved then says to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” Simon Peter, after he heard that 
it’s the Lord, took off the coat which was wrapped around him (he was naked 
underneath, you see) and dove into the sea. 
8|But the other disciples came in with the 
boat, seeing that they were not far from land, no, not far at all, only about 100 yards/90 
meters[C] away, dragging the net full of fish.
          
9|As they got out onto the dry ground, they see a charcoal fire spread out over 
the ground and grilled fish laid on top of the fire, plus bread. 
10|Jesus then tells them, 
“Pull out the fish that you caught just now.” 
11|So Simon Peter went over and 
dragged the net full of enormous fish onto the land, 153 in all. The net didn’t tear, even 
though there were so many fish.
          
12|Jesus then tells them, “Come have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples 
dared to question who he was—they knew he was the Lord. 
13|Jesus then comes 
and takes the bread and passes it out to them, and the grilled fish likewise. 
14|This 
is the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
          
15|When they finished with breakfast, Jesus then says to Simon Peter, 
“Simon son of John[D], do you love me more than these[a]?”
      He tells him, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you as a close friend does.”
      He then tells him, “Feed my lambs.”
          
16|He then says a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”
      He then tells him, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you as a close friend does.”
      He then tells him, “Be a shepherd[b] to my sheep.”
          
17|He then says a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me as a close 
friend does?”
      Peter was grieved that he said to him a third time, “Do you love me as a close 
friend?” He then says to him, “Lord, you know all things; you understand that I love 
you as a close friend.”
      Jesus then says to him, “Feed my sheep.”
          
18|”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth—I really am: when you 
were a young man in your late teens, you got yourself ready for the day ahead of you time 
and time again[c] and went here and there, wherever you wanted. But when you do 
finally grow old, you will stretch your hands out and another will get you ready[c] and 
will carry you where you don’t want to go.[E]” 
19|He said this signifying and 
insinuating what sort of death he will glorify God with. After he said this, he then tells 
him, “Follow me, even in death[d].”
          
20|Peter turns to face and look at the disciple who was following them, the 
one whom Jesus loved and loved, the person who also was the one leaning against him 
at the dinner[e] they had and said, “Lord, who’s your betrayer?” 
21|Looking at this 
fellow, Peter then says to Jesus, “Lord, now what about this fellow?” 
22|Jesus then 
tells him, “If I were to want him to remain on the earth until I come back again, what’s it 
to you? You follow me even in death.” 
23|So this statement circulated among the 
comrades[f], that that disciple won’t ever die. Now Jesus didn’t tell him that he wouldn’t 
die, rather, “If I WERE to WANT him to remain[F]…”
          
24|This is the disciple, the one who’s going on record and giving an official 
account[g] about these things and the one who’s writing this book of the Bible. And we 
know that his official account is trustworthy.
          
*[a]these…It’s unclear what the antecedent of these is. It’s could either refer to fish or refer to the other 
disciples.
*[b]be a shepherd…Or: lead; pastor
*[c]got yourself ready for the day ahead of you time and time again…will get you ready…Lit: were girding 
yourself…will gird
*[d]follow me, even in death…Lit: follow me. Also means, be my disciple. Same phrase used in Matt. 4:19.
*[e]at the dinner…Ref. John 13:23
*[f]comrades…Lit: brothers [brethren]
*[g]going on record and giving an official account…Lit: witnessing

*[A]boys…Not unusual in a lot of cultures to address grown men who are at work as boys. This is done in 
the Deep South; in France, waiters are called garcon (boy).
*[B]anything that’s edible—namely fish…The Gk. word here for edible occurs once in the NT and the 
lexicon is sparse on detail. The word is derived from food, and I’m guessing the prefix changes its 
meaning to ready-to-eat. The Gk. experts say that the word means fish, but they probably deduce this 
from the context.
*[C]100 yards/90 meters…Lit: 200 cubits. 1 cubit = 18 inches.
*[D]Simon son of John…Jesus speaking to him formally, somewhat like a mother talking to a misbehaving 
son using the full form of his first name, plus the middle and last names (for example: William Patrick 
Smith instead of just Bill).
*[E]you will stretch your hands out and another will get you ready [Lit: gird you] and will carry you where 
you don’t want to go…Church tradition says that Peter was crucified in his old age, and that this 
statement refers to his crucifixion. Stretching your hands out refers to Peter stretching his hands out to 
have them nailed to a cross, and carry you where you don’t want to go refers to taking the cross and 
posting it in the ground.
[F]if I were to want him to remain…The point John’s making is that Jesus is speaking hypothetically; he 
didn’t really intend for John to stay on the earth until his second coming.



Acts
       Luke writes another long treatise for Theophilus, who may have been his former master, a 
sequel to his Gospel. He picks up the story as he left off in his Gospel, and by the time he reaches Acts 
16:10 the narrative switches from they to we, as Luke joins Paul on his journeys.
       The book is named Acts of the Apostles, but it might be better named Acts of the Early Church.
       Luke at times will break into long sentences, like Acts 2:30,31. Of course, this long sentence is a 
quotation from Peter, and in that passage Luke captures a side of Peter which is unseen in the Gospels. 
In that spontaneous oration of Acts 2—which is one of the high points of the entire book—Peter follows 
a train of thought through a few quotations from the Old Testament with remarkable clarity and agility, 
to the point that even his opponents marveled at his newly-found rhetorical abilities (Acts 4:13). These 
came from the Holy Spirit which came upon him on Pentecost.
       More so than the other Gospel writers, Luke’s command of Greek allows him to pepper the text 
with a word here or there, broadening the meaning with nuanced implications, some of which take an 
entire half-sentence to convey to the English reader. An example this is in Luke 2:39, where he adds an 
additional word (and).
       Luke has a knack for finding imaginative metaphors. For example, in Acts 1:17 he compares 
Judas’s misfortune of being the one who betrays Jesus to someone who casts lots and loses. In Acts 2:1, 
the counting of days until Pentecost uses a term commonly used by ship captains as they fill their quota 
of cargo or tackle or whatnot before setting sail. In Acts 9:1, Paul is “still huffing [lit: breathing] 
murderous threats at the Lord’s disciples.” Interspersing hyperbole with metaphor, Acts 17:21 says, 
“Now all Athenians and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for anything other than talking 
about or hearing about something novel.”
       Luke quietly introduces Paul (Saul)—who after Jesus is the most influential figure in 
Christianity—in Acts 7:58 by showing him in the backdrop of the stoning of Stephen, letting the 
circumstances describe who Paul was rather than a description itself. Luke uses this introduction to 
transition from Stephen’s stoning at the end of the seventh chapter into Paul’s zealous persecution at 
the beginning of the eighth, eventually culminating in Saul’s conversion. In his deft use of indirection, in 
Acts 12:18, instead of directly saying “…a lot of commotion took place..,” he says instead, “When 
daylight came, no small amount of commotion took place among the soldiers.”
       An additional benefit gleaned from Luke’s narrative here is that it sheds light on expressions and 
idioms used throughout the NT. There are several occurrences of the expression “name of Jesus” where 
a character is doing this or that in the name of Jesus. The student of the Bible deduces the underlying 
meaning of the name of Jesus by its preponderance in Acts. Another example is “enter God’s kingdom” 
(Acts 14:22): the context of this verse indicates that this is an idiom, and one should keep that in mind 
when Jesus says how difficult it is for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom.
       In the earlier chapters of Acts, much of the dialog and wording sheds light on certain NT 
concepts. The fourth chapter specifies what the name of Jesus is; in Acts 4:9, we have captured in 
writing an incident of testing the Lord, and this expanded understanding of what it is to test the Lord 
sheds light on other NT verses, in this case for example, Matt. 4:7, 1 Cor. 10:9.
       To top it off, a pattern emerges in the story line, and it goes like this: a miracle occurs, the 
miracles draws the undivided attention of those who witness it, as their attention is captured, the 
message of the Gospel is delivered, and those who hear it are converted. Treats like that are found by 
those who look for them.

       The book is named Acts of the Apostles, but it might be better named Acts of the Early Church.
       Luke at times will break into long sentences, like Acts 2:30,31. Of course, this long sentence is a 
quotation from Peter, and in that passage Luke captures a side of Peter which is unseen in the Gospels. 
In that spontaneous oration of Acts 2—which is one of the high points of the entire book—Peter follows 
a train of thought through a few quotations from the Old Testament with remarkable clarity and agility, 
to the point that even his opponents marveled at his newly-found rhetorical abilities (Acts 4:13). These 
came from the Holy Spirit which came upon him on Pentecost.
       More so than the other Gospel writers, Luke’s command of Greek allows him to pepper the text 
with a word here or there, broadening the meaning with nuanced implications, some of which take an 
entire half-sentence to convey to the English reader. An example this is in Luke 2:39, where he adds an 
additional word (and).
       Luke has a knack for finding imaginative metaphors. For example, in Acts 1:17 he compares 
Judas’s misfortune of being the one who betrays Jesus to someone who casts lots and loses. In Acts 2:1, 
the counting of days until Pentecost uses a term commonly used by ship captains as they fill their quota 
of cargo or tackle or whatnot before setting sail. In Acts 9:1, Paul is “still huffing [lit: breathing] 
murderous threats at the Lord’s disciples.” Interspersing hyperbole with metaphor, Acts 17:21 says, 
“Now all Athenians and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for anything other than talking 
about or hearing about something novel.”
       Luke quietly introduces Paul (Saul)—who after Jesus is the most influential figure in 
Christianity—in Acts 7:58 by showing him in the backdrop of the stoning of Stephen, letting the 
circumstances describe who Paul was rather than a description itself. Luke uses this introduction to 
transition from Stephen’s stoning at the end of the seventh chapter into Paul’s zealous persecution at 
the beginning of the eighth, eventually culminating in Saul’s conversion. In his deft use of indirection, in 
Acts 12:18, instead of directly saying “…a lot of commotion took place..,” he says instead, “When 
daylight came, no small amount of commotion took place among the soldiers.”
       An additional benefit gleaned from Luke’s narrative here is that it sheds light on expressions and 
idioms used throughout the NT. There are several occurrences of the expression “name of Jesus” where 
a character is doing this or that in the name of Jesus. The student of the Bible deduces the underlying 
meaning of the name of Jesus by its preponderance in Acts. Another example is “enter God’s kingdom” 
(Acts 14:22): the context of this verse indicates that this is an idiom, and one should keep that in mind 
when Jesus says how difficult it is for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom.
       In the earlier chapters of Acts, much of the dialog and wording sheds light on certain NT 
concepts. The fourth chapter specifies what the name of Jesus is; in Acts 4:9, we have captured in 
writing an incident of testing the Lord, and this expanded understanding of what it is to test the Lord 
sheds light on other NT verses, in this case for example, Matt. 4:7, 1 Cor. 10:9.
       To top it off, a pattern emerges in the story line, and it goes like this: a miracle occurs, the 
miracles draws the undivided attention of those who witness it, as their attention is captured, the 
message of the Gospel is delivered, and those who hear it are converted. Treats like that are found by 
those who look for them.

Acts
25|Now there’s a lot of other things that Jesus did, so many so that if every 
detail were to be written down one-by-one, my hunch is that there wouldn’t be enough 
room in the world to store all the scrolls that would be written.


&ACTS 1
1|Indeed now—the previous composition which I drafted about everything, oh 
Theophilus, about what Jesus proceeded to do and do and teach and teach 
2|up until 
the day he was taken up into heaven, having left orders with the apostles through the 
Holy Spirit—apostles whom he had personally hand-picked. 
3|After his suffering, he 
also appeared to them alive using many demonstrations and proofs, making himself 
visible to them over the course of forty days and discussing matters related to God’s 
kingdom. 
4|While they were assembled, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem 
for a while, but instead to wait for the Father’s promise (quoting Jesus),
      “…Which you’ve heard about from me. 
5|While—yes—John baptized people by 
immersing them in water, but you, though, will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many 
days from now.”
          
6|Indeed now—when they were gathered together, they kept asking him over 
and over, “Lord, is this the moment in time you’re going to reinstate Israel as its own 
sovereign nation[a]?”
          
7|He told them, “It’s not been granted for you to know the exact dates or the 
windows of time[b] which the Father has established using His own authority. 
8|But 
never mind that—you will receive miracle-working power when the Holy Spirit has gone 
to you and come upon you, and you will attest to my truthfulness[c] in Jerusalem, in all 
of Judea and Samaria, and elsewhere—even as far as the furthest reaches of the planet.”
          
9|After he said these things, while they were still looking at him he was taken 
up: a cloud took him away out of their sight. 
10|As they were staring up into the 
sky while he was travelling upwards, two men dressed in white appeared out of 
nowhere and stood next to them, 
11|and they said, “Gentlemen, fellow Galileans[d], 
why are you just standing there looking up into the sky? This Jesus who was taken 
away from you up into the sky will come in the same manner which you’ve observed 
him travelling into the sky.”
          
12|They then returned to Jerusalem from what’s known as the Mount of 
Olives, which is near Jerusalem, about a half-mile/1 km[e] down the road. 
13|When 
they entered the city, they went to the top floor of where they were staying, they being 
Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of 
Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 
14|All of these fellows were 
in one accord and single-mindedly sticking to it—not getting side-tracked—in prayer, 
accompanied by women[f] and by Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers.
          
15|During the span of time they were up there, Peter stood up in the midst of 
the comrades (and there was a group consisting of 120 grown men, the figure not 
including the women, teens, and children) and said, 
16|”Gentlemen, fellow comrades[d], 
the verses in the Bible[g] had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand 
through David’s mouth about Judas, who became ringleader to those who apprehended 
Jesus, 
17|that he was considered to be one of us and that he wound up being the 
unfortunate one who performed this duty[h].”
          
18|To recap, that guy used some or all of the payment he received for his 
wrong-doing and acquired a plot of property with it, and got himself in a head-first 
direction and killed himself in such a way that his torso ruptured[A] and all of his intestines 
spilled out. 
19|This became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, resulting in 
that plot of land being called Akeldama in their language, which is translated “Plot of 
Blood,” 
          
20|Returning to what Peter said, ”Seeing that the Book of Psalms has recorded 
in it,

“Let his domicile go from occupied to unoccupied,
And from there on out 
Let there be no one who occupies it

“And,

“Let someone else assume his leadership position


21|”So it has to be one of the men who accompanied us the entire time that the 
Lord Jesus was acquainted with us[i], 
22|starting from John’s baptism up until the 
day which he was taken from us (namely that he was a witness of his resurrection), in 
order for one of these men to become one of us.”
          
23|Two candidates were put forward, Joseph who’s called Barsabbas, who’s 
also known as Justus, and Matthias. 
24|They prayed and said, “You, Lord, are 
intimately familiar with the hearts of everyone; point out the one you’ve selected from 
among these two 
25|to assume the position of this ministry and apostleship, which 
Judas usurped for his own purpose[i].” 
*[a]reinstate Israel as its own sovereign nation…Lit: restore the kingdom to Israel
*[b]exact dates or windows of time…Lit: times and seasons. Likely an expression; therefore, it’s meaning is 
more expansive than the literal rendering. The expansive meaning would include: sequences of events, 
prerequisites—things such as these.
*[c]will attest to my truthfulness…Lit: will be my witnesses
*[d]Gentlemen, fellow Galileans…Gentlemen, fellow comrades…Lit: Men, Galileans…Men, comrades. This 
rhetorical form is the opening to a public speech, as though one will attempt to persuade the audience.
*[e]half-mile/1 km…Lit: a Sabbath [permissible journey]
*[f]by women…Or: by their wives
*[g]verses in the Bible…Lit: the Scripture. Some liberties taken.
*[h]he wound up being the unfortunate one who performed this duty…Lit: the lot-casting the lot of this 
service. A metaphor is used whereby Judas competed in the casting of lots (a game of chance) and was 
the loser. We might say, “he would up being the one who drew the last stick and got stuck with 
performing this duty.”
*[i]was acquainted with us…Lit: entered and departed at us.
*[j]for his own purpose…Lit: to his Own Place
*[k]they flipped a coin, and Matthias won the toss…Lit: they gave them lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. 
Some liberties taken.

[A]got himself in a head-first direction and killed himself in such a way that his torso ruptured…Lit: 
became head-first and burst [the] middle. The verb form for head-first (πρηνής/Strong’s 4248) from verb 
pranizō/no Strong’s number) means to throw oneself head-first or to fall headlong, so other translations 
say that he dove head-first and that the impact of the fall caused his body to split open and his 
intestines to come out. But the word head-first also refers to the prone position, so the phrase became 
head-first could mean became prone instead. There’s not enough content and enough clarity to 
conclude with certainty that he dove head-first off a high cliff or off some other precipice—not to 
mention the practicalities of what that entails. Suffice to say that there remains ambiguity and 
uncertainty of what exactly Luke was talking about in this verse.

&ACTS 2
1|When all the days had been checked off until fifty were reached[A]—the Day 
of Pentecost—everyone was together and on the same page[a]. 
2|From out of the sky a 
noise suddenly occurred, one which seemed like a violent wind was being swept in[b], 
and it filled the entire building in which they were sitting. 
3|Tongues like the tongues 
of the flames from a fire were seen being distributed to them, and a tongue sat upon each 
and every one of them, 
4|and every one of them was filled with the Holy Spirit and 
began to speak in various tongues (other languages) as the Spirit kept on giving them 
the unction to be uttering in tongues.
          
5|Now there were Jews staying in Jerusalem, devout men, who were from 
every nation across the globe[c]. 
6|So when this sound happened, a bunch of them, 
confused, gathered together, because each person kept hearing them speaking in his 
own dialect of his own language. 
7|They were non-stop confused and kept on 
wondering saying, “Don’t look now—but aren’t all of these folks who are speaking 
Galileans? 
8|And how is it that each of us can hear what’s being spoken in his own 
native dialect of his own native language?— 
9|Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those who 
live in Mesopotamia, Judea and not only there but in Cappadocia, Pontus, the province 
of Asia, 
10|Phrygia, and not only there but Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of 
Libya around Cyrene; visitors from Rome, 
11|both Jews and Gentiles who’ve 
converted to Judaism; Cretans and Arabs—we all hear them in our own languages 
saying things which magnify God.” 
12|Now everyone kept on being amazed, 
confused and perplexed, telling one another, “What in the world’s going on[d]?” 

13|But others, jeering, kept on saying something to the effect, “They went off and got 
drunk on sweet wine[B], the stuff the winos are always drinking.”
          
14|Peter along with the eleven others stood to address the crowd, raised his 
voice, and announced, “Men, Judeans[l], and everyone who’s staying in Jerusalem: may 
you listen to what I have to say and may this become understood to you. 
15|The 
fact of the matter is, it’s not what you think, that is that these people are drinking, 
seeing that it’s only nine in the morning, 
16|but instead this is what’s spoken 
through the prophet Joel,


17|”’In the Last Days, things will turn out this way,’
God says:
‘I’ll pour out My Spirit onto all flesh.
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
Your young men will see visions,
Your elderly men will dream dreams.

18|In those days I will pour out My Spirit
Upon My male and female servants—
Indeed I will—
And they will prophesy.

19|I will grant that wonders occur in the sky above
And signs upon the earth below:
Blood, fire, and smoke trails.

20|The sun will change into darkness
And the moon into blood
Prior to the coming
Of the Great and Marvelous Day of the Lord.

21|And things will turn out this way:
All who choose to call for the Lord to act on his behalf
In the way He is reputed to act[e]
Will be spared calamity[f].’

          
22|”Men, Israelites[l], listen to what I’m telling you. Jesus of Nazareth was a 
man who had been appointed by God to act on our behalf, and God performed miracles, 
wonders, and signs for us through him in your midst, as you all know. 
23|By the 
specific determination of God, one which He decided ahead of time, this man was 
apprehended and taken into custody by bad, out-of-control men, fastened to a cross, 
and the cross was hoisted up as a form of execution. 
24|God resurrected this man, 
having broken the travail of death, on account of the fact that it wasn’t possible for him 
to be overpowered and constrained by death, 
25|seeing that in the Scriptures David 
told him,

“Throughout it all, I kept on seeing the Lord ahead of time
In the area that I was most concerned about[g]
Because He is right where I need Him[h]
So that I don’t get rattled.

26|Because of this, I rejoiced in heart and uttered exultations,
And, what’s more, my physical well-being
Will occupy the spot where hope exists[i],

27|Because You have not left the essence of my life-being
In the graveyard[j],
Nor will You allow your Holy One to undergo decay.

28|Having familiarized me with the way of life,
You will fill me with gladness
With Your undivided attention[k].

          
29|”Men, comrades[l], it’s appropriate to address you with confidence 
concerning our patriarch David, to say that he too passed away and was buried, and 
that his tomb has been right nearby from the day he died up until the present time. 

30|So being a prophet and knowing that God made an oath and ‘swore to him that 
from out of the collection of those whom he would sire and their offspring, one of them 
would sit on his throne,’ 
31|while seeing into the future, he spoke about the 
resurrection of Jesus; the fact is,

“He has neither been left to the graveyard,
Nor has his flesh undergone decay


32|”God resurrected this Jesus-fellow, of which we all are witnesses, 
33|and 
thereupon promoted him to the position of God’s Chief Executive[m]—not only that but 
having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he’s poured out all of 
this that you see and hear. 
34|You see, David didn’t ascend into heaven, but it was 
he specifically who said,

“The Lord said to my Lord,
‘Assume the role of being My right-hand man

35|Until such time I choose
To subjugate your enemies in obeisance to you[n]’


36|”Let it be known with certainty to the entire Israeli ethnicity-nation[o] that God 
made him both Lord and Messiah (Christ), this Jesus-fellow whom you crucified.”
          
37|Now, after they heard this, it caused their hearts to melt[p], and they told 
Peter and the rest of the apostles, “What should we do about it, men, comrades?” 

38|Peter told them, “Have a change of heart and of ways[q] and go ahead and have 
each of you be baptized by the authority of[r] Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your 
sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
39|You see, the promise is for 
you, for your children and for everyone who’s far away—it is just as much given to the 
one as to the other[C]; in other words, it is for all those whom the Lord God happens to or 
chooses to summon.” 
          
40|He kept on stating[D] a lot of other declarations, and kept on appealing to 
them summarized by saying, “May you escape[s] from this twisted contemporary 
Zeitgeist[t].” 
41|So those who took to heart and acted upon[u] his message were 
baptized, and on that day around three-thousand individuals were added. 
42|They 
were faithful to keep listening to the apostles’ instruction, to keep having fellowship-
dinners together, dinners culminating in a communion memorial[v], and to keep 
attending the prayer meetings.
          
43|Now a deep reverence was continually maintained, and many signs and 
wonders kept on occurring through the apostles. 
44|Now all of those believing 
were on the same page in regard to the previously mentioned things and shared 
everything, 
45|and properties and possessions kept on being sold[w], and that 
which was sold kept on being distributed to every person according to whoever 
happened to have a need[E]. 
          
46|Not only that but day by day they continued to be faithful to be in one 
accord in the temple, and furthermore they continued to attend the dinners mentioned 
previously from house to house, sharing food with great joy and simplicity of heart, 

*[a]on the same page…Lit: upon the same
*[b]being swept in…Lit: being carried
*[c]across the globe…Lit: under the sky

*[h]He is right where I need Him…Lit: he is out of my right hand
*[i]I rejoiced in heart and uttered exultations, and, what’s more, my physical well-being will occupy the 
spot where hope exists…Lit: my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted and what’s more my flesh will 
dwell at hope. A mixed figure of speech, a mixture of synecdoche and personification. 
*[j]the essence of my life-being in the graveyard…Lit: my soul to Hades
*[k]with your undivided attention…Lit: with your face
*[l]Men, Judeans…Men, Israelites…Men, comrades…Ref. note of Acts. 1:11.
*[m]promoted him to the position of God’s Chief Executive…Lit: having been exalted to the right hand of 
God
*[n]Assume the role of being My right-hand man until such time I choose to subjugate your enemies in 
obeisance to you…Lit: sit at My right [hand] until I would place your enemies under your feet.
*[o]Israeli ethnicity-nation…Lit: house Israel
*[p]it caused their hearts to melt…Lit: they were pierced the heart
*[q]Have a change of heart and of ways…Lit: repent
*[r]by the authority of…Lit: upon the name of
*[s]escape…Lit: be saved. The rendering of the Gk. word save or saved is context-specific. This rendering is 
the same as that of Matt. 19:25.
*[t]contemporary Zeitgeist…Lit: generation
*[u]took to heart and acted upon…Lit: received
*[v]fellowship-dinners together, dinners culminating in a communion memorial…Lit: the Breaking-of-the-
Bread-Fellowship
*[w]properties and possessions kept on being sold…Lit: properties and possessions kept on selling. The GT 
uses the active voice instead of the passive, perhaps an expression similar to what we use in English.

*[A]When all the days had been checked off until fifty were reached…Lit: in the day of the fifty filling-
together. The Gk. word for filling-together refers to manning a ship with a full complement of sailors. In 
other words, filling-together is a metaphor which compares the counting of the days until fifty is 
reached to a ship captain who desires to set sail but needs a nominal number of sailors, and sailors with 
a list of essential skills. The captain cannot depart until he fills out his quota, so he searches the harbor 
looking to recruit sailors needed to staff his ship. He sets sail immediately once the quota has been 
filled.
*[B]sweet wine…This is a young, sweet wine, the wine known as must. It’s likely a wine that’s drunk 
undiluted, a wine which has a higher alcohol content, is less expensive, or both: the beverage-of-choice 
when the goal of is to get drunk as easily and as cheaply as possible.
*[C]it is just as much given to the one as to the other…This phrase is not an interpolation but is justified by 
the insertion of the word and before the word children, an and which is in addition the and between 
children and everyone who’s far away. In v. 39 here, Luke says that the promise is for those closest to 
you and that you have the closest human bonds to—your children—and for those who are furthest from 
you geographically and for whom you have no human bond whatsoever. The point he’s making (and he 
clears this up immediately after) is that if the promise is for both extremes relationally and physically, 
then certainly it is for everyone else.
*[D]stating…Lit: witnessing. The Gk. word witness is used throughout Acts, John’s Gospel and his epistles, 
and elsewhere in the NT. This usage in v. 40 here is about as good a definition of what is meant by 
witnessing as can be found anywhere in the NT. First, begin with an understanding of the usage of 
witness in the OT, which is a person testifying in a court of law. After that, study the context of v. 40 
here, and the definition of witnessing becomes apparent. Apply this understanding to other places in 
the NT where witness is used (Acts 1:8 for example).
[E]distributed to every person according to whoever happened to have a need…Some have said that this 
(and Acts 4:35) rings of Karl Marx’s quotation, “From each according to his ability, to each according to 
his need.” Keep in mind the following, however. First, Luke states this as a fact and does not say that it 
was a command, confirmed by what Peter said in Acts 5:4. Second, the apostles were convinced that 
Jesus would return to earth any day now—certainly no more than a few weeks hence—so what’s the 
use of owning property? Third, Acts 8:1 said that there was a great persecution against the church in 
Jerusalem. In such a persecution, those persecuted would surely have had their property confiscated, so 
they might’ve anticipated this and sold what they owned preemptively. Fourth, not everyone sold what 
they owned; otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to meet from house to house (v. 46), as there 
wouldn’t have been any houses to meet at. Fifth, this was an extraordinary period of revival, and 
extraordinary things happen in extraordinary revivals, things that don’t otherwise happen.

were going on.


&ACTS 3
1|Now Peter and John went over to the temple at the Three-in-the-Afternoon-
Prayer-Time, 
2|and a certain man who was lame from the time he was born, having to 
be carried around all time, was there, whom some people day after day kept on placing at 
the temple gate known as the Beautiful Gate, so that he could beg for handouts from 
those entering the temple complex. 
3|Seeing that Peter and John were about to go into 
the temple complex, he asked for a handout. 
4|Peter stared at him, and John joined in 
with him, and Peter said, “Look at us!” 
5|He proceeded to give heed to them, looking 
at them and paying attention to them, waiting to—expecting to—get something from 
them. 
6|Peter said, “I don’t have any cash on me[A], but I’ll give you what I’ve got[a]: by 
the authority vested in me by Jesus Christ of Nazareth[b], get up and walk around[B]!”— 

7|And he grabbed him by his right hand and pulled him up—And immediately his 
feet and ankles were strengthened and made sturdy— 
8|And with a leap he stood up 
and started walking around and entered the temple complex together with them, 
walking around, jumping, and praising God. 
9|All the folk-people saw him walking 
around and praising God, 
10|and they recognized him as the same beggar who 
used to sit where the beggars sit at the temple’s Beautiful Gate, and they were filled with 
amazement and exhilaration at how things had turned out for him.
          
11|While the lame man was clutching Peter and John, folks everywhere[c] at 
the colonnade known as Solomon’s Colonnade ran towards them, utterly amazed. 

12|Seeing this, Peter responded to the crowd, “Men, Israelites[d], why are you 
amazed at this? Why are you staring at us as though we enabled him to walk by our 
own power or piety? 
13|The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of 
Jacob—the God of our patriarchal ancestors—glorified His servant[e] Jesus, whom you 
all had arrested and whom you all rejected in the very presence of Pilate, after that guy 
delivered a verdict that would have set him free. 
14|You rejected the holy and 
righteous one and asked for a homicidal man—a murderer—to be let off the hook and 
given back to you. 
15|You killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised from the 
dead, of which we are witnesses. 
16|And based on[f] the faith which is derived from 
Jesus’s authorization to act[g], this person whom you see and know first-hand—Jesus’s 
authorization to act strengthened him and made him sturdy, and right in front of you all, 
the through-him-faith[h] gave him this perfect health which you see. 
17|Yes indeed 
comrades, I know that you conducted your lives in a way which is consistent with 
ignorance, just like your predecessors and ancestors did, 
18|but the God that made 
the suffering of His Messiah known ahead of time through the mouth of all the 
prophets caused these things be fulfilled in this manner.
          
19|”So now, have a change of ways[i] and turn your hearts to the obliteration 
of your sins, 
20|in order that episodes[j] of refreshing would issue forth from the 
Lord’s totally-focused attention[k], and He would send you the one who’s already been 
appointed to a position of authority, Christ Jesus, 
21|whom the spiritual world[l] will 
most definitely embrace up to the times of the establishment of everything that God has 
spoken through the mouth of His saints—namely the prophets—from day-one. 

22|Yes, in the Old Testament Moses said that,

“The Lord our God will bring to prominence a prophet
And send him your way,
A prophet from among our fellow men—
One who is like me.
You shall listen to what comes out of him
And you shall act in accordance to everything
That he happens to say to you.

23|What will happen to any individual
Who chooses not to listen to that prophet
Is that he will be absolutely annihilated,
Never seen or heard from again[m].

          
24|”Indeed, all the prophets starting with Samuel, including those who 
came afterwards, talked about and announced these days that we’re living in. 

25|You all are the beneficiaries[n] of the prophets and of the covenant which God 
entered into with our ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘All of the nationalities[o] of the 
earth will be blessed by one of your descendants[p].’ 
*[a]but I’ll give you what I’ve got…Lit: but that which I have, this I give you
*[b]by the authority vested in me by Jesus Christ of Nazareth…Lit: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
*[c]folks everywhere…Lit: all the people
*[d]Men, Israelites…Ref. note of Acts. 1:11.
*[e]servant…Or: boy. The other Gk. word rendered servant is alternatively rendered slave. This is not; this 
is more of a household servant.
*[f]based on…Lit: at or upon
*[g]Jesus’s authorization to act…Lit: his name
*[h]the through-him-faith…Or: the by-means-of-him-faith
*[i]have a change of ways…Lit: repent
*[j]episodes…Lit: seasons or appointed times
*[k]the Lord’s totally-focused attention…Lit: the face of the Lord
*[l]the spiritual world…Lit: heaven
*[m]absolutely annihilated, never seen or heard from again…Lit: annihilated [or obliterated] from the 
people. An expression used throughout the OT.
*[n]beneficiaries…Lit: sons
*[o]nationalities…Lit: patriarchies [lineages]. The idea is that every person on the earth is a descendant 
from some ancient patriarchy, and, though these lineages can no longer be traced, they still exist.
*[p]one of your descendants…Lit: your seed [sperm]. Metonymy for a descendant who will come later.

*[A]I don’t have any cash on me…Lit: silver and gold I don’t possess with me. This sounds like an 
expression, as one would expect Peter to say he has no silver, as the word silver itself is a synonym for 
money. Furthermore, one doesn’t usually give a gold coin to a beggar.

around instead.

&ACTS 4
1|While they were talking to the folk-people, the priests, the temple guards, 
and the Sadducees showed up, 
2|exasperated because of them teaching the people 
and proclaiming Jesus’s resurrection from the dead, 
3|and they arrested them and put 
them in jail until the next day; you see, it was evening already. 
4|Many of those who 
heard the message became believers, and the number of men (not including women and 
children) who believe in Jesus reached five thousand.
          
5|Now what happened the next day is that the rulers, the councilmen, and the 
designated teachers[a] convened in Jerusalem— 
6|and Annas the High Priest was 
among them, and Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and any person at all who was born 
into and, as a result, belonged to the high priests’ caste. 
7|They made them stand in the 
center for questioning,
      “By what governmental power have you done this, or who authorized you to do 
this in their agency[A]?”
          
8|Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, told them, “Rulers of the people and 
councilmen: 
9|If we’re being questioned in court today in reference to a good deed 
done to a feeble man, namely as to just how exactly this fellow has been pulled out of his 
miserable condition[b]: 
10|Let it be known to every one of you and to all of the folk-
people of Israel that at the behest of and by the authority of Jesus[c] of Nazareth, whom 
you all crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by using this delegated authority, this 
fellow stands before you completely well. 
11|That is,

“The stone treated with contempt by you, the builders
Has become the principal cornerstone


12|”There is no security and protection for our natural and spiritual lives[d] in 
anyone else; the fact of the matter is, there is no other person of impeccable reputation 
and of authority[e] among the breadth of the varieties of peoples everywhere[f] that the 
human race has ever produced and put forward as a candidate of such[g] in whom it is 
absolutely necessary to be rescued from our deplorable spiritual, mental, and physical 
condition[h].”
          
13|Gawking at the boldness and confidence with which Peter and John were 
speaking, and floored by the fact that the men were uneducated and untrained, they 
were flabbergasted and began to notice that they had a close connection with Jesus, 
having been a part of his life and ministry. 
14|Furthermore, seeing the man standing 
there in unison with them—the one who had been healed—they couldn’t come up with 
anything to say against the whole affair. 
15|Ordering them to leave the council 
chamber, they huddled together 
16|saying,
      “What should we do about these people, since it certainly has become apparent 
to everyone who’s visiting or living in Jerusalem that a recognizable miracle[i] has 
occurred through them, and we can’t deny it? 
17|We can’t let this go on; instead, so 
that this won’t continue to spread more and more among the folk-people, we’ll threaten 
them telling them to no longer speak to any person using this authority as the basis for 
their speaking[j].”
          
18|They summoned them and ordered them not to teach—not even to utter 
a peep[k]—acting on the basis of Jesus’s authority[j]. 
19|Responding to that order 
Peter and John told them, “You make the call whether God considers heeding you more 
than heeding Him the right thing to do; 
20|you see, as far as we’re concerned, we 
can’t NOT talk about what we’ve seen and heard.”
          
21|After they were threatened, they released them, not being able to figure 
out a way they could punish them on account of the folk-people, because everyone 
glorified God over what had happened; 
22|you see, the man whom this miraculous 
healing happened to was more than forty years old.
          
23|After they were released, they went to their own particular group of 
people[l] and reported what the chief priests and the councilmen told them. 

24|After they heard this, everyone single-mindedly and in unison raised their 
voices and directed their words towards God and said, “Master, You who made the sky, 
the earth, the sea, and everything in it, 
25|who, by means of the Holy Spirit, spoke 
from the mouth of our ancestor, Your servant[m] David,

“Just why, now, did the people
In all the various nations become insolent[n]?
The folk-people carefully planned
Things which are useless, 
26|for which
The kings of the land stood nearby in support,
And the rulers were assembled for the same purpose:
To oppose the Lord and to oppose His Messiah (Christ).


27|”The fact is, they actually were assembled in this city for the purpose of opposing 
Your holy servant[m] Jesus, whom You singled out to be specially chosen and to be given 
special, supernatural abilities[o]—they being Herod and Pontius Pilate joined by the 
Gentiles and the Israeli people— 
28|to do what Your situational control[p] and Your 
well-thought-through plan decided ahead of time would happen. 
29|And now, 
Lord, take a good, hard look at their threats and grant that Your servant speak Your 
message time after time with total boldness and confidence, 
30|while at the same 
time You supernaturally intervene[q], the intervention resulting in healings, miracles, 
and supernatural portents occurring through the authority placed in[j] your holy 
servant[m] Jesus.”
          
31|After they were done praying, the place they were gathered was shaken, 
and everyone there was filled with the Holy Spirit and then began to speak God’s 
message with boldness and confidence once they left and got on with their daily business.
          
32|Now the sizable group of believers was of one heart, mind, and soul, and 
not a single person was saying that anything that he owned belonged to him exclusively, 
but instead everything was kept in common between them. 
33|The apostles kept 
on putting the account[r] of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus out there by means of 
tremendous miracles, and tremendous grace (i.e., God’s favor and His willingness to act in 
their behalf and to act through them) was upon them. 
34|In fact, not a person among 
them was in need. You see, those who owned properties or houses and other buildings 
kept on selling them and selling them and bringing the proceeds of the sales 
35|to 
the apostles, placing the proceeds in under their care and ownership[s]. Money, goods, and 
the like were continuously being distributed to each person in proportion to what a 
given person happened to need[B].
          
36|Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which translated means “the 
epitome of one who fills the role of[t] assistant, advocate, counselor, and encourager[C]”), 
a clergyman[u], Cyprian by birth, 
*[a]the rulers, the councilmen, and the designated teachers…Lit: the rulers, the elders, and the scribes
*[b]pulled out of his miserable condition…Lit: saved
*[c]at the behest of and by the authority of Jesus…Lit: in the name of Jesus. Ref. note of v. 7.
*[d]security and protection for our natural and spiritual lives…Lit: salvation. Also see Luke 1:69
*[e]person of impeccable reputation and of authority …Lit: name
*[f]among the breadth of the varieties of peoples everywhere…Lit: under the sky. An expression, one 
similar to the expression under the sun, found in Ecclesiastes 1:9.
*[g]that the human race has ever produced and put forward as a candidate of such…Lit: that has been 
given in men
*[h]rescued from our deplorable spiritual, mental, and physical condition…Lit: saved
*[i]recognizable miracle…Lit: known [or recognizable] sign
*[j]using this authority as the basis for their speaking…acting on the basis of Jesus’s authority…through the 
authority placed in…Lit: upon this name…upon the name of Jesus…through the name of. Ref. notes of vv. 
7,10.
*[k]not to teach—not even to utter a peep…Lit: neither to utter [a word] nor to speak. A figure of speech, a 
hendiadys of a sort.
*[l]their own particular group of people…Lit: their own. An expression; also used in John 1:11.
*[m]servant…Or: boy. Ref. Acts 3:13.
*[n]insolent…In regard to the usage of this word, quoting Max & Mary: “properly of prancing and 
whinnying of high-spirited horses”
*[o]You singled out to be specially chosen and to be given special, supernatural abilities…Lit: anointed
*[p]situational control…Lit: hand
*[q]You supernaturally intervene…Lit: extend Your hand
*[r]account…Lit: witness
*[s]to the apostles, placing the proceeds under their care and ownership…Lit: putting [it] near the feet of 
the apostles. A NT idiom, one which is a variation of the expression found in Eph. 1:22.
*[t]the epitome of one who fills the role of…Lit: son of. Expression used throughout the Bible. Also, ref. 
note of Matt. 8:20.
*[u]clergyman…Lit: Levite. Some liberties taken.

*[A]who authorized you to do this in their agency…Lit: in what name you did this. The phrase in his name 
or something akin to it is used throughout the NT, and this occurrence here in vv. 7 and 9 provide one of 
the best examples of what the phrase means. To do something in the name of someone else means one 
or several of the following: To do something at one’s bidding or command; to do something as one 
authorized by another, using delegated authority which the other grants; to acquire the right to do 
something that one naturally has no right to do, only because of the reputation or authority of the one 
whose name is invoked. Related to in his name, ref. notes of Matt. 21:9; Mark 9:41; Mark 16:17; Rom. 
2:24.
*[B]distributed to each person in proportion to what a given person happened to need…Ref. note of Acts 
2:35
[C]assistant, advocate, counselor, and encourager…The well-known Gk. word paraklātos 
(παράκλητος/Strong’s 3875) is used here, and the word has several meanings. The specific meaning of 
paraklātos which best applies to Barnabas, however, can be discovered by studying what Barnabas did 
through the Book of Acts (Acts 11:23–26, for example) and drawing conclusions based on that. Barnabas 
assisted Paul in his missionary journeys, but also advocated for Mark, thereby causing a dispute 
between him and Paul. In the end, though, Barnabas’s judge of Mark’s character was vindicated by 
Mark’s maturity.

Acts
37|being the owner of a field, sold it and gave the 
money to the apostles, putting it in their custody.


&ACTS 5
1|Now a certain man named Ananias sold a piece of property in conjunction 
with his wife Sapphira 
2|and withheld—appropriated—part of the proceeds, keeping 
the money for himself (his wife was in on it too) and gave a certain amount to the 
apostles, placing it under their care and ownership[a]. 
3|Peter told him,
      “Ananias, how is it[b] that Satan filled your heart causing you to lie in the presence 
of the Holy Spirit and appropriate some of the sales price from the sale of the property? 

4|While you still had it, wasn’t it yours to keep[A], and after it was sold, didn’t you 
have the right to retain control over the proceeds? How did this whole affair get lodged in 
your heart? You didn’t lie to human beings but to God.”
          
5|While Ananias was listening to these words, he dropped dead. An enormous 
sense of awe and reverence—downright fear—came over[c] all those who were listening. 

6|The older teens and younger men wrapped his body up, carried him out, and 
buried him.
          
7|About three hours went by and his wife came in, unaware of what had 
happened. 
8|Peter reacted to her entrance,
      “Tell me: did you sell the property for X amount of dollars?”
      She said, “Yes, for X dollars.”
          
9|Peter said to her, “Why did you two conspire to try to pull a fast one on[B] the 
Spirit of the Lord? Take a look at the feet[C] of those who buried your husband at the 
door[D]—and they’re going to carry you out as well.”
          
10|She immediately dropped dead alongside his feet. The older teens and 
younger men came in, checked that she was dead, and took her and buried her next to 
her husband. 
11|A sense of awe and reverence—downright fear—came upon the 
entire community of believers and upon those who heard what happened. 
          
12|Lots of miracles, all kinds of them[d], occurred among the folk-people. 
Everyone was on the same page, sharing the same heartfelt passion, meeting in the part of 
the temple complex called Solomon’s Colonnade. 
13|As far as everyone else was 
concerned, no one was daring enough to join them, but apart from that, the people 
thought they were awesome. 
14|More and more kept being added to their party, 
those who believe in the Lord that is, and not only men but women too, 
15|to the 
point that they were even bringing out into the streets those with maladies of one sort 
or another, physical problems that were dragging them down[e], and placing them upon 
single-person dining couches[f] and cots, so that when Peter came through he might 
possibly peer down and check in on[E] any one of them and offer assistance in the form of 
healing. 
16|Swaths of people in the vicinity of Jerusalem began to gather, bringing 
those with maladies and those inflicted by dirty, disgusting[g] spirits, all of whom kept 
on getting healed or otherwise treated for whatever was wrong with them.
          
17|The High Priest and all those associated with him (those who belong to 
the Sadducees sect) were stirred to action[h] by a competitive, passionate zeal, 

18|and they apprehended[i] the apostles and put them in the city jail. 
19|But 
some time during the night, an angel[F] unlocked the cell door and lead them out, and 
said, 
20|”Go stand in the temple complex and tell all the short messages—the 
accounts, stories, sayings, and anecdotes—of this new life in Christ, and do this over and 
over again.” 
21|Once they heard this, they entered the temple at the crack of dawn 
and proceeded to teach.
      Now the chief priest came over while leading his entourage of associates—the 
Council with all of the councilmen[j]—and they sent word to the city jail to retrieve them. 

22|But when the attendants got there, they didn’t find that they were in the jail, so 
they turned around, went back, and reported it, 
23|saying, “We found that the city 
jail was firmly locked down and found the prison guards standing at all of their posts at 
all of the doors. After they opened the door and let us in, we discovered that no one was 
there.” 
          
24|As they heard these words, both the commander of the temple guard and 
the high priests were perplexed over how this could’ve happened. 
25|Someone 
showed up and reported to them, “Check this out—the men whom you put in jail are 
standing in the temple complex teaching the folk-people.” 
26|Then the commander 
with a party of attendants attached to him proceeded to get them again and take them 
away—but not by employing violent force, since they were wary and fearful of the 
people, lest they be pelted with stones.
          
27|After they brought them into the council chamber, they were made to stand 
before the Council. The High Priest questioned them, 
28|”Didn’t I absolutely and 
emphatically command[k] you not to teach basing your authority to speak on this 
person[l]? See here now—Jerusalem’s been filled with your teaching, and you want to 
blame us and have us assume the guilt and consequences for this man’s death[m].”
          
29|Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God over obeying people. 

30|God our Father resurrected Jesus, whom you got your grubby hands on and 
killed, having hung him on a wooden cross-beam[G]. 
31|God exalted this person, this 
number-one leader and savior, to the position of chief executive officer, to be His right-
hand man[n], to grant a change of heart and of ways[o] to Israel and a forgiveness of sins. 

32|You personally are first-hand witnesses of these affairs and of the Holy Spirit 
whom God gave to those who obey Him.”
          
33|This hit a real sore spot with those who heard this, and they became 
infuriated and were wanting to kill them. 
34|A Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher 
of the Law of Moses who was well-respected by all the folk-people, got up in the council 
and ordered the men out for a short while 
35|and said to them, “Men, Israelites[p], 
stop, take a look at yourselves, and think for a moment about what you’re about to do 
to these men. 
36|The fact is, a good while ago, Theudas came to prominence, 
claiming to be someone special, and four hundred men joined up with him. Everyone 
who believed in his cause[q] disbanded, and his cause amounted to nothing. 
37|After 
this, Judas the Galilean came to prominence during the time that the census was being 
taken, and he led a group of people away in apostasy. And that guy perished too, and 
everyone who believed in his cause[q] dispersed.
          
38|”With that in mind, at this point in time I’m telling you to walk away 
from these men and leave them alone, because if either the intentions themselves or this 
cause as a whole happens to be man-made, it will be demolished. 
39|But if it 
originates from God, you won’t be able to wipe them out—lest it become self-evident[r] 
that you’re fighting against God.”
      They were persuaded by him, 
40|and they summoned the men, beat them, 
and commanded them not to speak based on Jesus’s authority[l] and set them free. 

41|They therefore proceeded to go their way rejoicing after facing the Council 
because they had been deemed worthy to be dishonored on behalf of Jesus’s authority 

*[a]placing it under their care and ownership…Lit: he brought a certain portion and placed it near the feet 
of the apostles. An idiom; ref. note of Acts 4:35.
*[b]how is it…Lit: through what [Usually rendered: because of what; why; on what account]
*[c]came over…Lit: came to pass
*[d]miracles, all kinds of them…Lit: signs and wonders. A biblical expression.
*[e]maladies of one sort or another, physical problems that were dragging them down…Lit: weaknesses. 
Ref. note of Matt. 4:23.
*[f]single-person dining couches…A piece of furniture used to recline on while dining
*[g]dirty, disgusting…Lit: unclean
*[h]were stirred to action…Lit: rose up. Common usage of the verb rise in the Bible. 
*[i]apprehended…Lit: laid their hands on. A common NT phrase.
*[j]the Council with all the councilmen…Lit: the Sanhedrin and all the elders of Israel
*[k]absolutely and emphatically command you…Lit: command you with a command. This repetition of the 
word command is a figure of speech.
*[l]basing your authority to speak on this person…based on Jesus’s authority…Lit: upon this name…upon 
the name of Jesus. Ref. note of Acts 4:17
*[m]you want to blame us and have us assume the guilt and consequences, for this man’s death…Lit: you 
wish to bring upon us the blood of this man.
*[n]to the position of chief executive officer, to be His right-hand man…Lit: to His right hand
*[o]a change of heart and of ways…Lit: repentance
*[p]Men, Israelites…Ref. note of Acts 1:11
*[q]who believed in his cause…Lit: he persuaded to him
*[r]it become self-evident…Lit: it be found

*[A]While you still had it, wasn’t it yours to keep…Lit: a remaining to you kept remaining [Gk: menon soi 
emenen (μένον σοὶ ἔμενεν), (μένον/Strong’s 3306), (σοὶ/Strong’s 4771), (ἔμενεν/Strong’s 3306)]. In the 
GT, the terse wording of the phrase, the repetition of the verb menō, and the fact that this is a quotation 
of someone speaking and is not narrative leads to the conclusion that this is an expression, and 
therefore has a meaning beyond the face-value word-for-word transliteration. The bottom line is that an 
equivalent English expression for this Gk. expression would be, “what’s yours is yours.”
*[B]to try to pull a fast one on…Lit: to test; to tempt. The context of the usage of the Gk. word peiradzō 
(πειράζω/Strong’s 3958) used here in v. 9 sheds light on the meaning of this multi-faceted word, aiding 
in one’s understanding of how it’s used in other passages, Matt. 4:7, 1 Cor. 10:9 for example.
*[C]Take a look at the feet…Of course, Peter meant take a look at the young men instead. The word feet is 
a synecdoche for the young men themselves. Throughout the Bible, the word feet is symbolic of what a 
person does at a high-level, or the things a person does which are more involved than simple actions. 
The word hand is for simple actions, but feet is symbolic of something which requires a sequence of 
actions to complete. In this verse here, Peter’s synecdoche indicates what the young men are about to 
do. Of particular interest is how deeply rooted such figures of speech were in the Israelis of that time, 
that they were used in impromptu, conversational speech such as this. We can assume that Jesus talked 
the same way; passages such as Matt. 18:8, though they sound out of place to the modern ear, were 
commonplace remarks for the time and place. 
*[D]at the door…One possible reason that those who carried off Ananias where standing at the doorway 
instead of being in the building could be because, having handled a dead body, they were unclean 
according to Jewish purity law and therefore were banned from rejoining the others.
*[E]peer down and check in on any one of them…Lit: the shadow would cast a shadow on [or overshadow] 
any one of them. Not absolutely certain, but this appears to be an idiom/expression. This phrase paints a 
picture of someone sitting or lying on the ground when the sun’s shining, and someone else walks up to 
this person stands near them in such a way as to block the sun. Sometimes movies, especially Westerns, 
have scenes like this where a stronger person approaches a weaker person and blocks the sun when 
close. The weaker person squints up until when the stronger person is close, and he no longer needs to 
squint because of the shadow provided by the stronger person. The stronger person has come by to 
have an encounter of some sort with the weaker person—in this case, for Peter the stronger, the one 
standing, to heal the weaker one, who’s sitting or lying due to his weakness.
*[F]an angel…Lit: an angel of the Lord. At times the NT uses the phrase angel of the Lord instead of simply 
angel (Luke 2:9 for example) to clarify any ambiguity as to the meaning of angel, specifying the angelic 
being as opposed to a human being. Since the word angel is rendered a couple different ways into 
English, once in English there’s no need to retain the words of the Lord as the ambiguity has been 
stripped. Also, ref. usage in Rev. 1:20.
[G]having hung him on a wooden cross-beam…A figure of speech—a synecdoche—where instead of using 
the obvious words crucify, cross, etc., which the listener normally hears used, the act of crucifixion is 
described in more detailed, graphical terms. To illustrate by analogy, if we were to describe someone 
being executed by electrocution in the following way: “We shaved his head, strapped him in a chair, put 
electrodes on his head and legs, and jolted him with electricity,” instead of simply saying, “We 
electrocuted him,” which every listener would understand. The point of such figures of speech is to 
illustrate how barbaric the act was, as the well-known words, being overly used, desensitizes one to the 
reality of what was perpetrated.

reality of what was perpetrated. 

Acts
42|and didn’t stop meeting in the temple complex and from house to house every 
day, teaching and proclaiming the good news—the Gospel—of Christ Jesus.


&ACTS 6
1|Now during this timeframe when the number of disciples was expanding, a 
complaint originated from the Greek-speaking Jews against the native Israeli Jews, that 
their widows[A] were being overlooked in the Daily Meal Service. 
2|So the twelve 
summoned the bulk of the disciples and said, “We’re not happy about neglecting the 
teaching of God’s word by being restaurant waiters[a]. 
3|Look into the matter, 
comrades, and come up with seven men from among you that it’s been observed[b] and 
generally agreed are full of spirit[B] and wisdom, whom we might put in charge of this 
matter[C]. 
4|We, though, will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the 
word of God.”
          
5|The reasoning put forth was agreeable in the view of the large group 
assembled, and Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Procorus, 
Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, who was a convert to Judaism from Antioch, 
were chosen. 
6|They stood these men before the apostles, and after they prayed for 
them, they laid their hands on them. 
7|And the word of God kept on being 
proclaimed, being received, and producing results[c], and the number of disciples in 
Jerusalem continued to grow at a high rate, and a bunch of the priests began to obey by 
believing in the faith.
          
8|Now Stephen, full of grace—God’s favor and His willingness to work 
through him—and miracle-working capability, began to perform tremendous miracles[d] 
among the people. 
9|Some people from the synagogue of those who are said to be 
Freedmen, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and the Roman Province of 
Asia asserted themselves, arguing with Stephen, 
10|and didn’t have the strength of 
words to withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he continuously spoke. 

11|Then they got men to claim that, “While he was speaking, we definitely heard 
him make a blasphemous remark against the Bible[e] and God,” 
12|and stirred up 
the folk-people, the councilmen, and the designated teachers[f] and descended on him 
all of a sudden, apprehended him, and brought him into the Council chamber. 

13|From there, the phony witnesses produced testimony saying, “This man won’t 
stop uttering remarks against this Holy Place and the Bible[e]. 
14|The fact is, we 
definitely heard him saying that this Jesus-of-Nazareth-guy will destroy this place and 
alter the traditions which Moses passed down to us.” 
*[a]by being restaurant waiters …Lit: to serve tables. Some liberties taken. Serving tables is more a figure 
of speech akin to hyperbole than a completely accurate description of what the apostles were doing.
*[b]it’s been observed…Lit: being witnessed
*[c]kept on being proclaimed, being received, and producing results…Lit: kept on growing
*[d]miracles…Lit: signs and wonders
*[e]the Bible…Lit: Moses. Some liberties taken.
*[f]the councilmen, and the designated teachers…Lit: the Elders and the Scribes

*[A]widows…Widows were the poorest in society, since they had no one to care for them and no way to 
earn a substantial living. Ref. note of Mark 12:40.
*[B]spirit…In this context, the word spirit means deeply-rooted fervor, dedication, etc. It is listed as a 
personal quality just as wisdom is listed as such. It does not mean Holy Spirit, in spite of other 
translations rendering this the Spirit, short for the Holy Spirit. In the Bible the word spirit has multiple 
meanings; sometimes it means Holy Spirit, sometimes it means a person’s spirit, sometimes it refers to a 
deeply-rooted disposition of one sort or another (example of that is 2 Tim. 1:7). The NT writers 
understood the potential for ambiguity, and if, when writing, they were referring to the Holy Spirit, they 
added qualifiers to the word spirit where ambiguity might exist. (Or they added qualifiers for emphasis.) 
The qualifiers consist of adding an article, adding the word Holy, or forming a full predicative construct. 
So in v. 5, such a qualifier is added, as Stephen is full of the Holy Spirit, not full of spirit. But the usage in 
v. 3 has no qualifiers, is paired with another personal quality wisdom, so therefore does not refer to the 
Holy Spirit.
[C]put in charge of this matter…This key phrase indicates why the seven—the first church deacons—had 
to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do their job. They were put in charge of the food 
distribution in order to ensure that it was being done fairly, that widows were not being overlooked 
because of their ethnicity. This required spirit and wisdom. But it is not a necessary prerequisite for the 
ordinary church worker to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do the simple, mundane labor that 
all churches require (such as being an usher, a greeter, etc.). Faithfulness and a willingness to work with 
others is about all such a worker needs. Furthermore, the takeaway from this passage is that a deacon is 
an overseer, one who can oversee an area of responsibility which is fraught with moral challenges; the 
run-of-the-mill church worker is not a deacon. If the qualification for every church worker was that he 
had to be filled with spirit and wisdom (in addition to being faithful and getting along with others), then 
there would be very few church workers, and much work would remain undone. Also, see description of 
deacon in note of 1 Cor. 15:24.

Acts
15|The panel of councilmen 
fixed their eyes upon him and looked at his face and saw that his countenance was like 
the countenance of an angel.


&ACTS 7
1|So the high priest said, “Is this so?”
          
2|He began to speak and said, “Men, comrades, and patriarchs: listen to me. 
The God of Glory appeared to our ancestral patriarch Abraham while he was living in 
Mesopotamia, prior to him getting settled in Harran, 
3|and told him, ‘Leave your 
homeland and your relatives and go to a country which I will point out to you at some 
point.’ 
4|He then left the country of Chaldea and settled in Harran. After his father 
died, from there he relocated to this country, to where we live now, 
5|and he wasn’t 
given a tract of land in this country, one that he and his descendants would own in 
perpetuity—not even a tiny plot that would’ve been barely big enough to get by on[a]—
And he had been promised that, ‘This country be granted to him, given to him for him to 
own, he and his descendants—his progeny[A]—after him,’ while not having a son at the 
time. 
6|Here’s what God had to say to him: ‘This is what’s going to happen: his 
descendants—his progeny[A]—will be foreigners and outsiders in another country, and 
those in the other country will enslave them and mistreat them for four hundred years. 

7|And I will judge the nation (i.e. personally intervene and put an end to the evil that 
they’re doing) who made the decision to enslave you…,’ God said, ‘…and after these 
things have occurred, they will leave and come back to this place here and continuously 
offer up worship by attending to an ongoing service of rituals.’
          
8|”And He imparted to him a covenant comprised of circumcision. According 
to this set of instructions, he sired Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day after his 
birth, and Isaac did this to Jacob, and Jacob to the twelve patriarchs, the ancestral founders 
of what would be the twelve tribes of Israel.
          
9|”But the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and handed him over to be put in 
the custody of some Egyptians; but God was with him, 
10|and delivered him out 
of all of his tribulations and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of the king of 
Egypt, that is Pharaoh, and he was put in charge over Egypt and over his (Pharoah’s) 
entire ruling clan and staff. 
11|Now a famine came out of nowhere and oppressed[b] 
Egypt and Canaan causing a terrible ordeal, and our eleven patriarchal ancestors weren’t 
able to find enough food to eat. 
12|Jacob heard that there was wheat in Egypt and 
sent out our ancestors as envoys to make the initial contact. 
13|Second time around 
Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s birth, lineage, and ethnicity 
were made apparent to Pharaoh. 
14|Joseph sent a message and summoned Jacob 
his father to his side and all the relatives, a total of seventy-five individuals, 
15|and 
Jacob went down to Egypt. He died and so did our twelve ancestors, 
16|they 
relocated to Shechem, and he was placed in the tomb which Abraham bought (paying 
in cash[c]) from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
          
17|”Just as the time for the fulfillment of the promise which God promised to 
Abraham got closer, the Israeli people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
18|until 
‘…Another king ascended to power over Egypt, one who wasn’t affiliated with the 
Israeli people.’ 
19|This fellow used cunning, Machiavellian techniques against our 
people and mistreated our ancestors going so far as to expose their babies to the raw 
elements to where they wouldn’t survive. 
20|That was the timeframe in which 
Moses was born, and he was polished, charming, courteous, polite, witty, and elegant to 
the highest degree[d]—he who had spent three months being raised in momma’s 
house[e]. 
21|While he was exposed to the raw elements in order to die, Pharaoh’s 
daughter adopted him as her own son 
22|and trained and disciplined Moses in 
every sort of Egyptian wisdom and sophistication; he was formidable in speech, ability, 
and actions.
          
23|”Now as he reached the age of forty, he felt an urging[f] to visit his 
kinsmen, the Israelites. 
24|While seeing someone being ill-treated, he came to his 
defense and took vengeance on the one being oppressed and struck down the Egyptian 
oppressor. 
25|Now he was assuming that his brethren would understand that, 
through his abilities and actions[g], God was coming to their rescue[h], but they didn’t 
understand, 
26|and the following day he appeared to some men as they were 
fighting and tried to get them to reconcile with one another and said, ‘Men, you’re 
kinsmen, why are you hurting each other?’ 
27|But one who was harming his 
acquaintance[i] spurned him and said, ‘Who appointed you to be a ruler and a judge 
over us? 
28|I hope you don’t want to eliminate me the same way you eliminated the 
Egyptian yesterday.’ 
29|Moses fled at this remark, and became a stranger and a 
foreigner in the land of Midian, where he gave birth to a couple of sons.
          
30|”When forty years were completed, ‘…An angel appeared to him in the 
Mt. Sinai wilderness in the flame of a burning bush.’ 
31|Seeing this, Moses was 
captivated by such a sight. While approaching it, a commanding voice appeared, 

32|’I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses 
became terrified and dared not try to wrap his head around the whole thing. 

33|’The Lord said to him, “Take your sandals off; the place on which you’ve come 
to stand is holy ground. 
34|I’ve seen[j] the mistreatment of My people in Egypt and 
have heeded their groaning and have come down to deliver them. Go now: I’m sending 
you to Egypt.”’
          
35|“This Moses whom they spurned by saying, ‘Who appointed you ruler 
and judge?’—this is the ruler and deliverer God sent with the assistance of an angel that 
was seen by him in the bush. 
36|This person led them out of Egypt and performed 
spectacular miracles[k] for forty years in the country of Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the 
wilderness. 
37|This person is Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will bring to 
prominence in your midst a prophet like me from among your kinsmen.’
          
38|”This is the fellow who was present in the gathering in the wilderness, 
along with the angel which spoke to him on Mt. Sinai and with our ancestors, and is the 
person who was shown living words to give to us, 
39|whom our ancestors didn’t 
want to become subordinate to, but instead rejected and in their hearts turned back to 
Egypt, 
40|having told Aaron, ‘Make us gods that will be our banner on the march 
and in battle, ensuring success at every turn[B]. The fact is, this Moses-fellow who led us 
out of Egypt—we don’t know what’s become of him.’ 
41|During that timeframe 
they did the calf-making-thing and proceeded to offer up sacrifices to the idol and to 
rejoice in what their hands had wrought. 
42|So God turned His head from them and 
let them have their own way in enacting worship to the vast array of planets and stars 
in the sky[l], just like it’s written in the prophet-section of the Old Testament[m],

“‘You didn’t bring Me offerings and sacrifices
When you were in the wilderness for forty years,
Now did you house of Israel?

43|But you applied yourselves to Molok’s house of worship[n]
And to your star-god Rephan
And to the idols which you created
For the purpose of worshipping them.
Because of this I will exile you
To a place which is somewhere out beyond Babylon[C].’

          
44|”The tabernacle of the ark of the covenant existed with our ancestors in 
the wilderness just the way the end-to-end specifications were dictated to Moses to be 
built according to the blueprint he got to see; 
45|the tabernacle which our ancestors 
took turns entering while[o] Joshua was taking possession of the lands owned by foreign 
nations, nations which God drove out by the onslaught[p] of our ancestors up until the 
timeframe of David, 
46|who found favor in the eyes of God, and he begged God 
that he would be allowed to come up with a plan to build a permanent tabernacle for the 
lineage of Jacob. 
47|But instead Solomon built Him a building—a home— 

48|but no—the Most High doesn’t reside in man-made structures, just like the 
prophet says,


49|“’To Me, the heavens are a throne
And the earth is a stool that I use to rest My feet on.
What sort of house will you make for me,’ says the Lord,
‘Or what would be the place which I rest?

50|Has not My hand made all of these things?’

          
51|”Unyielding and unchanged in hearts and ears[D], you always resist[q] the 
Holy Spirit; you’re just like your ancestors. 
52|Tell me—which prophet did your 
ancestors not persecute? Which one? They killed those who announced ahead of time 
things associated with the coming of the Righteous Man, whom you’ve become traitors 
to and murderers of— 
53|you the very people who received the Law of Moses, 
taking it to be an angelic ordinance, but didn’t keep it.”
          
54|Having heard these things, they were piqued and went into a rage of 
fury[r] and proceeded to grit their teeth, biting down hard, gnashing them[s] against him. 

55|Being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed up into the sky, to where heaven is, and 
saw God’s glorious magnificence and Jesus standing at God’s right hand (signifying that 
he’s completely vested in all executive powers) 
56|and said, “Check this out—I see the 
sky up to heaven opened up and the Man[t] standing at God’s right hand.” 
57|They 
screamed with their ears covered tightly, rushed him in unison, 
58|took him out of 
the city and proceeded to stone him to death. And the witnesses (who according to the 
Law of Moses must be the first to cast stones) took their jackets[u] off and set them next to an 
aspiring young man named Saul[E]. 
59|As they were stoning Stephen he invokes 
heaven saying,
      “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”

typically describing agony.

*[C]I will exile you to a place which is somewhere out beyond Babylon…As it says in Ps. 37:29, “The 
righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.” Going back to Genesis, God promised the

disobeyed, they would eventually be driven out. Out beyond Babylon shows how far away they’ll be 
removed from the promised land.

10:16). Stiff-necked means a person won’t bend his head either downwards in contrition or upwards in 
hope and faith. Circumcision is the OT pact, the acceptance of and entry into God’s covenant. Also, the 
removal of the foreskin in the circumcision ceremony symbolizes the peeling away and discarding of a 
hardened outer layer surrounding the heart (Deut. 10:16).

jackets (cloaks actually) was done so that the witnesses would be able to move about more freely when 
casting the stones. It’s also a gesture of intent, analogous to high school boys who are about to get into 
a fight and taking off their jackets and showing how tough they are while doing so. Once the high school 
boy takes off his jacket, he turns a person next to him and hands him his jacket for safekeeping. Now the 
boy who’s about to get into a fight would’ve been flanked by his close friends, so the person he hands 
his jacket to is a close friend. All of this paints a picture of who Saul was; he was standing next to the 
witnesses, so he was part of the inner clique, someone who was trusted, someone who, though 
younger, was permitted to tag along closely with the high-priest-caste. When the witnesses put their 
jackets next to Saul, the assumption was that Saul was responsible for their safekeeping. As the 
witnesses quickly scanned their throng looking for someone to entrust their jackets to, Paul was the 
logical choice because of his trustworthiness, his close proximity to the witnesses (indicating his zeal), 
and his youth (indicating that he was the younger among elders). It’s more appropriate to give a young 
man menial duties than someone who’s older and more senior.

60|He dropped to his knees and loudly shouted out, “Lord, may you not 
hold them accountable for[v] this sin.”
      Having said this, he went to sleep (i.e. he died as a believer).


&ACTS 8
1|Now Saul whole-heartedly agreed with eliminating Stephen.
      On that day a terrible persecution broke out against the church—the gathering of 
believers—in Jerusalem. Everyone scattered over the Judean and Samarian countryside 
except for the apostles. 
2|Devout men buried Stephen and mourned greatly for him 
during the period of mourning held for him. 
3|Saul proceeded to go from house to 
house ravaging the church, barging in[a] and dragging off men and women, arresting 
them and putting them in jail.
          
4|Those who were scattering throughout the countryside were announcing the 
good news message—proclaiming the Gospel, the good news of the Word. 
5|Philip 
went over to a Samaritan city and proceeded to preach Christ to them. 
6|The crowds 
eagerly took in the various statements made by Philip, united in one heart and mind in 
their listening and in their watching miracles that he performed. 
7|The fact is, many 
filthy, disgusting spirits were being cast out[b] one after another, crying out in a loud 
voice as they left. Many paralyzed and lame were being healed. 
8|Much joy took place 
in that city.
          
9|Now a certain man named Simon used to awe the Samaritans in the city by 
practicing magic, claiming to be someone special[c], 
10|a person who captivated 
everyone’s attention, from the insignificant to the important, what they were describing 
as, “God’s miracle-working power: the Bomb.[d]” 
11|They kept paying attention to 
him for a long time, dazzled by the works of magic. 
12|But when they believed 
Philip proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom and proclaiming the authority 
vested in Jesus Christ and what he’s all about[e], they proceeded to be baptized, men and 
women both. 
13|Simon himself also believed and, once baptized, while sticking 
like glue to[f] Philip and seeing spectacular miracles[g] and tremendous miracle-working 
abilities, kept on becoming more and more enchanted by having been dazzled over and 
over again.
          
14|Now once the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had whole-
heartedly embraced and acted upon[h] God’s word, they sent them Peter and John, 

15|such individuals who[i] would go over and pray for them so that they would 
receive the Holy Spirit[A]: 
16|for he (the Holy Spirit) had not yet fallen[B] upon any 
one of them, but they only existed in a state where they had been baptized[C] into all that 
the Lord Jesus stands for[j]. 
17|Then they laid hands on them and they began 
receiving the Holy Spirit. 
18|Simon, seeing the Spirit given through the apostles’ 
laying on of hands, offered them money 
19|saying,
      “Give me this ability too, so that the person I lay my hands on would receive the 
Holy Spirit.”
          
20|But Peter said to him, “Get lost—I hope you die—you and your money 
along with you[k]—since you assumed you could acquire God’s offering[D] to mankind 
through cash. 
21|You don’t get to participate in this business—not even a bit[l], 
seeing that your heart is not right in God’s sight[m]. 
22|So abandon[n] this 
wickedness and beg the Lord if he would somehow possibly forgive your heart’s 
intention; 
23|the fact is, I see that you’re coughing up bitterness and are 
handcuffed by unrighteousness.”
          
24|In response, Simon said, “You all pray to the Lord on my behalf, so that I 
won’t be afflicted by what you’ve said[o].”
          
25|So then they thoroughly presented and spoke about the concept of the 
Lord and returned to Jerusalem, and many Samaritan towns began to have the good 
news proclaimed in them.
          
26|Now an angel spoke to Philip, “Head on out south on the road which 
runs from Jerusalem to Gaza, the one that nobody uses.” 
27|He got going. Out of 
nowhere an Ethiopian man appeared, a eunuch who had control over the Queen of 
Ethiopia’s entire treasury, one who had gone to Jerusalem to worship 
28|and was 
on the return trip sitting on his chariot and reading out of the prophet Isaiah. 

29|The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up to him and join his chariot.” 
30|Philip ran 
over to him and heard him reading[E] out of the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Hmm…do 
you really understand what you’re reading?” 
31|He said, “Ya, about that. How 
would I be able to unless someone walks me through it?”, and he asked Philip to climb 
aboard the chariot, sit down together with him, and help him out. 
32|The passage 
of Scripture which he was in the middle of reading was this:

Like a sheep led to slaughter
And like a lamb speechless before the shearer:
In the same way he won’t open his mouth.

33|In his self-abasement his justice has been stripped from him.
How can anyone possibly describe
The prevailing Zeitgeist of his time[p],
Since his life has been wiped off the face of the Earth[q]?

          
34|Upon reflection the eunuch said to Philip, “Can I ask you whom the 
prophet’s talking about here? Is he talking about himself or about someone else?” 

35|Philip opened his mouth and, from this passage of Scripture, began to tell him 
all about the good news of Jesus. 
36|As they were going down the road, they 
stumbled across some water, and the eunuch said, “Look—water: what’s stopping me 
from getting baptized?”

38|He ordered his chariot to come to a halt, and 
both of them—Philip and the eunuch—got off the chariot and went into the water, and 
Philip baptized him. 
39|When they got out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took 
hold of Philip and redirected him[r], and the eunuch didn’t see him anymore; you see, he 
was going his way rejoicing. 
*[a]barging in…Lit: entering

*[d]God’s miracle-working power: the Bomb…Lit: God’s [miracle-working] power called great. This 
sentence is assumed to be conversational in nature, like a slang expression.

*[A]the Holy Spirit…the definite article (the) isn’t in the GT, but in Acts 5:3 the definite article is present in 
the Holy Spirit. Although there are several reasons for inclusion or exclusion of the definite article, it 
appears that the inclusion of the article in Acts 5:3 emphasizes the Holy Spirit as a person, whereas the 
exclusion here in v. 15 emphasizes the effects that the Holy Spirit has after coming upon a person.
*[B]fallen…There is a distinction between the Holy Spirit being in a person and the Holy Spirit falling upon 
a person. The Holy Spirit went into the eleven when Jesus breathed on them in John 20:22. Later, the 
Holy Spirit fell on the eleven (plus one) on Pentecost.
*[C]they only existed in a state where they had been baptized…Existed in a state is the Gk. word huparchō 
(ὑπάρχω/Strong’s 5225), and the words had been baptized reflect the Gk. perfect participle to be 
baptized. This adds clarity to the fact that they had become believers and were baptized in water but 
that the Holy Spirit had not come upon them. It is the rule and not the exception that the Holy Spirit 
comes upon a person a span of time after he becomes a believer.
*[D]God’s offering…Or: God’s gift. The Gk. word for gift here (dōrean), (δωρεάν/Strong’s 1432) is not the 
same word for gift used in 1 Cor. 12:4 (charisma), (χάρισμα/Strong’s 5486); the word charisma is 
expected. A dōrean is a gift brought and offered to another, like the offerings of the OT Mosaic Law. A 
dōrean is also a gift that the recipient has earned or deserves, whereas a charisma is a gift a person 
hasn’t earned. Charisma comes from charis (grace), (χάρις/Strong’s 5485); ref. note of Rom. 12:6). 
Therefore, the gift (dōrean) of the Holy Spirit is something that God brings to mankind and presents as a 
gift, as an offering.
*[E]heard him reading…In ancient times, those who could read always read aloud and never silently to 
themselves, even when alone.
[F]vs. 37 would read: Philip said, “If you believe with all of your heart, you may.” He said in response, “I 
believe the Son of God to be Jesus Christ.” This verse is not to be found in almost all of the best 
manuscripts, and is therefore a spurious addition. Verse 37 is instructive of text added years after Luke 
wrote Acts. Rather than attempting to propagate a lie, it attempts to embellish the text.

40|Philip wound up in Azotus, and while travelling 
through there kept on proclaiming the good news to all of the cities all the way to 
Caesarea.


&ACTS 9
1|Saul, still huffing murderous threats[a] at the Lord’s disciples, went to the 
high priest 
2|and asked—begged—for letters of authorization from him to present to 
the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he were to find anyone belonging to “the 
Way”[A], either man or woman, once they’re caught and tied with rope, he would lead 
them to Jerusalem. 
3|While travelling he was nearing Damascus and suddenly a light 
from up in the sky—from out of heaven—flashed around him, 
4|and he fell to the 
ground and heard a voice saying to him,
      “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
          
5|He said, “Who are you, sir?”
      “This is Jesus, the one you’re persecuting. 
6|But enough—get up and go into 
the city, and you’ll be told what you must go about doing.”
          
7|His fellow travellers stood speechless, without doubt hearing the voice but 
not seeing anyone. 
8|Saul got up off the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he 
couldn’t see a thing; he entered Damascus being led by the hand. 
9|For three days he 
had no sight and didn’t eat or drink anything.
          
10|Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord 
spoke to him in a dream,
      “Ananias.”
      He said, “I’m here, Lord.[b]”
          
11|The Lord told him, “Get yourself ready and go down Straight Street and 
look in Judas’s house for a man named Saul who’s from Tarsus; you see, he’s praying 
for help 
12|and saw[c] a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in 
order to recover his sight.”
          
13|Ananias replied, “Lord, a lot of people have told me about this man[d], 
about how much harm he’s done to the set-apart-people[e] in Jerusalem— 
14|and he 
has the backing[f] of the high priest to catch and tie up anyone in this location who’s 
inviting you into his life[g].”
          
15|The Lord said to him, “Get going, since he’s a specially-chosen 
instrument of mine—this fellow is—to take what I stand for[h] and with pains bring it to 
the attention of foreign nations, and not just foreign nations but kings and Israeli 
descendants scattered all around[B]. 
16|In fact, I’ll show him how much he’ll have to 
suffer on behalf of acting as my representative[h].”
          
17|So Ananias left and entered the house, laid his hands upon him, and 
said, “Saul, fellow comrade[C], the Lord sent me—Jesus, the one who appeared to you 
while you were on the way here—in order that you would regain your sight would be 
filled with[i] the Holy Spirit.” 
18|And without delay something akin to fish scales 
fell away from his eyes, and he regained his sight. He took the initiative and was 
baptized. 
19|Once he got something to eat, he was invigorated.
      He spent several days with the Damascus disciples. 
20|He straightaway 
proceeded to preach Jesus—that this person is the Son of God—in the synagogues. 

21|Again and again everyone who heard him was amazed, and they started 
saying, “Isn’t this the guy who’s wreaking havoc on those in Jerusalem who’ve invited 
Jesus into their lives[g]? Hasn’t he come here for the same reason, so that he could take 
the ones he’s caught, tie them up, and bring them right to the high priest?” 
22|But 
Saul proceeded to become all the more forceful and confounded the Jews living in 
Damascus, demonstrating through proofs that this very person Jesus is the Messiah, the 
Christ.
          
23|As a good many days had gone by and things were coming to a head, the 
Jews conspired to eliminate him, 
24|but their plot became known to Saul. They 
even started monitoring the gates closely, not just by day but by night too, so that they 
could eliminate him, 
25|but in spite of this disciples took him one night and put him 
all the way through the city wall and lowered him down in a large basket.
          
26|After arriving in Jerusalem, he kept attempting to join up with the 
disciples, but a lot of them kept on being afraid of him, not believing that he actually 
was a disciple. 
27|So Barnabas got ahold of him and brought him to the apostles 
and told them all about him: how he was on the road and saw the Lord, and that the 
Lord spoke to him…how in Damascus he was speaking out on behalf of Jesus and all 
that he stands for[j]. 
28|He accompanied them while entering and leaving 
Jerusalem, accompanying them the entire time while in Jerusalem, speaking out on behalf of 
the Lord and all that he stands for, 
29|and he proceeded to speak to and to have 
discussions—to the point of arguing—with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to 
apprehend him in order to eliminate him. 
30|The comrades[k] recognized that this 
was a problem and brought him over to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
          
31|So now the church up and down the entire stretch of Judea, Galilee, and 
Samaria experienced peace, being edified and conducting their lives[l] in the deep 
reverence—the fear—of the Lord, and with the assistance and comfort of the Holy 
Spirit, they were growing and growing.
          
32|While Peter happened to be travelling all throughout the area, he also 
went over to the-set-apart-ones[e] living in Lydda. 
33|He found a man there, a 
certain person named Aeneas, who had been bedfast for the last eight years, a person 
who had become paralyzed. 
34|Peter told him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing 
you: get up and make your bed.” Immediately he got up. 
35|Everyone living in 
Lydda and Sharon saw him; those very people turned to the Lord.
          
36|Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which 
translated means “Dorcas.” She was teeming in good works and in donations to the 
poor[m], which she was constantly contributing. 
37|During that timeframe she 
happened to get run-down with an illness, becoming sick to the point of death and 
eventually dying. They bathed her and put her in the top floor of a building. 

38|Lydda being close to Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was over there and 
sent two men to him asking him earnestly—begging him, “Hurry up! Come over to our 
place!” 
          
39|Peter got up and went with them and, once he arrived, was ushered up 
to the upper floor. All the widows stood next to him crying and showing the oh-so-
many tunics and cloaks which she was in the habit of making[D] while she was with 
them. 
40|Peter pushed everyone out of the room, and got on his knees and prayed 
and turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes and, seeing 
Peter, sat up. 
41|He gave her a hand and got her up. He called for the set-apart-
people[e] and presented her alive from the dead. 
42|What happened became known 
up and down the entire Joppa stretch, and many believed in the Lord. 
*[a]murderous threats…Lit: threat and murder. A hendiadys. Ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[b]I’m here, Lord…Lit: hey I, Lord
*[c]he saw…The best manuscripts are divided here; the others say, in a vision he saw.
*[d]a lot of people have told me about this man…Lit: I’ve heard from a lot of people about this man
*[e]the set-apart-people…Or: the saints
*[f]backing…Lit: authority
*[g]inviting you into his life…invited Jesus into their lives…Lit: calling upon your name…calling upon this 
name
*[h]what I stand for…acting as my representative…Lit: my name
*[i]with…Lit: of [from]
*[j]on behalf Jesus and all that he stands for…Lit: in the name of Jesus
*[k]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[l]conducting their lives…Lit: walking
*[m]donations to the poor…Lit: alms
*[n]Simon Tanner…Or: Simon the tanner

*[A]”the Way”…The sect or movement that believed in Jesus was called the Way. One had to be Jewish to 
join the Way. It wasn’t until Acts 11:26 that those who believe in Jesus are called Christians, where one 
believes in Jesus without first being Jewish, coming to God while circumventing Judaism altogether.
*[B]Israeli descendants scattered all around…Lit: sons of Israel. The assumption is that this refers to the 
Hellenistic Jews scattered throughout the Roman Empire.
*[C]fellow comrade…Lit: brother. Saul had become a brother in the Lord before Ananias prayed for him to 
receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit; being baptized in the Holy Spirit almost always occurs at a time 
after believing in Jesus. Therefore, Saul was a believer already, when he was baptized in the Holy Spirit. 
Since the Holy Spirit comes to live in every believer at the time they receive Christ, the baptism in the 
Holy Spirit must be something different.
[D]was in the habit of making…From the sounds of it, Tabitha used to make clothing and donate it to the 
needy. Those whom she showed the most generosity to in life (i.e. the widows) wept the hardest when 
she died.

43|As it 
turned out, he remained a good amount of time in Joppa with one Simon Tanner[n].


&ACTS 10
1|In Caesarea a certain man named Cornelius, a centurion in a battalion[a] 
named “From (the Roman province of) Italia[A],” 
2|a devout Gentile who, together with 
his entire household, was a sympathizer and near-convert to Judaism[B], often giving 
contributions to the poor-folk and constantly praying to God[b], 
3|around three o’clock 
in the afternoon distinctly saw an angel in a vision enter this world and go to him and 
say, 
      “Cornelius.”
          
4|Once he stared at him, he became afraid and said, “What is it, sir?”
      He told him, “Your prayers and donations have percolated upwards to where 
they’ve garnered God’s attention, and He’s quite pleased by what He sees[C]. 
5|Send a 
few men to Joppa right now and summon Simon, who goes by ‘Peter.’ 
6|This fellow’s 
being boarded by one Simon Tanner, whose house is next to the sea.” 
7|As the angel 
who was speaking to him left, he called for two men from his household staff and a 
pious soldier from among those who waited on him. 
8|He explained everything to 
them and dispatched them to Joppa.
          
9|During the next day, while those men were on the road and getting near to 
the city, Peter went out on the back deck[D] around noon to pray. 
10|He got hungry 
and had a hankering to eat. While they were getting the noon meal ready, what 
happened is that he fell into a trance 
11|and sees that the sky had been opened up 
and sees an object something like a huge, four-cornered cloth sheet coming down, being 
lowered to the ground, 
12|on top of which[c] was every type of four-footed animal, 
were reptiles[d], and were birds from the sky—In other words, all sorts of animals which, 
according to Jewish kosher laws, Jews are forbidden to eat. 
13|Out of nowhere a voice 
addressed him, “Get to it, Peter: slaughter and eat them.” 
14|But Peter said, “No 
way, sir, since I’ve never eaten anything which isn’t kosher[e].” 
15|Again a second 
time a voice from the sky spoke to him, “The item which God has purged of its non-
kosher-ness is permissible for you to eat[E].” 
16|This happened a third time and 
immediately after that the object was taken up into the sky.
          
17|While Peter was turning things over in his head, being stumped at what 
the vision he’d witnessed could possibly mean, out of nowhere the men who were sent 
by Cornelius stopped at the gate asking around about Simon’s house, 
18|and in 
their conversation proceeded to inquire if Simon who goes by Peter was staying at this 
place. 
19|While Peter was thinking over the vision, the Spirit told him, “Take a 
look—three men are looking for you. 
20|Enough said—go down, go over, and 
introduce yourself to them; I’ve sent them, no doubt.” 
21|So Peter went over to the 
men and said, “Hey, I’m the one you’re looking for. What’s the reason you’ve come?” 

22|They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and a Jewish-
sympathizer—plus well-spoken-of and respected by the whole Jewish race—was 
divinely instructed by an angel to have you sent to his house and to listen to a message 
by you.” 
23|As a result he invited them in and entertained them, letting them stay 
at his place.
      The next day, he got ready and departed with them, and some of the comrades[f] 
from Joppa came with him. 
24|The following day, they arrived in Caesarea; 
Cornelius was waiting for them to arrive and gathered together his close friends and 
relatives. 
25|Now just as Peter arrived, Cornelius went up to him and prostrated 
himself before him in worship[g]. 
26|Peter got him up by saying, “Get up: me—I’m 
just a human being.” 
27|Conversing with him, he entered the house and discovered 
that a lot of people had gathered there 
28|and said to them, “You understand that 
it’s forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit someone of another race. But 
God showed me that the item which has been purged of its non-kosher-ness (talking 
about a person in this case) is to be permitted. 
29|Therefore, I had no objection to 
coming when you sent for me. So let me ask: what reason have you summoned me?”
          
30|Cornelius said, “Starting four days ago up until this very moment we 
were praying just like we pray during the Three-in-the-Afternoon-Prayer-Time[h] in my 
house, and—just like that—a man dressed in white appeared out of nowhere and stood in 
front of me 
31|and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayers and donations have percolated 
upwards to where they’ve garnered God’s attention, and He’s quite pleased by what He 
sees. 
32|So now, send some men to Joppa and send for Simon who goes by Peter. 
This fellow’s being boarded in Simon Tanner’s house next to the sea.’ 
33|So 
without delay I dispatched some men your way, and you’ve kindly acquiesced to being 
brought here. So at this time all of us are on the edge of our seats waiting[F] to hear and 
to obey everything that you’ve been directed and commanded by the Lord.”
          
34|Peter opened his mouth and said, “I’m really, really floored[i] by the fact 
that God doesn’t show partiality, 
35|but instead those in every race, culture, and 
nationality who reverence Him and go about doing right are acceptable to Him[j]. 

36|He sent the word out to the Israeli descendants issuing a good-news 
proclamation of peace through Jesus Christ—this person is everyone’s Lord— 

37|you know about it: the affair that happened all throughout Judea, starting in 
Galilee after the baptism that John preached: 
38|That God singled out and specially 
chose Jesus of Nazareth and put on him[k] an oh-so-powerful-dose of the miracle-
working power of the Holy Spirit[l], who then, since God was with him, went 
throughout the confines of Israel doing good works and healing all who were being 
oppressed by the devil[G]. 
39|We ourselves are eyewitnesses to all that he did in the 
country occupied by the Jews and in Jerusalem—he that they hung on a wooden cross-
beam[m] and killed. 
40|God resurrected this fellow on the third day and caused him 
to be seen by the naked eye and appear before people, 
41|but not to be seen by any-
old person but instead to provide evidence to those hand-picked beforehand by God—
that is us—the very people who ate and drank together with him after his resurrection 
from the dead. 
42|He commanded us to preach to the folk-people and to solemnly 
testify that this fellow is the one who’s been promised by God; this fellow is a judge of 
the living and the dead. 
43|To this end, all of the prophets affirm the receiving of 
forgiveness of sins through his authority and what he stands for[n]…”
          
44|While Peter was still in the middle of saying this, the Holy Spirit fell (i.e. 
they were baptized in the Holy Spirit by the Spirit manifesting Himself in a strong, sudden way 
inside of them, to the point of having trouble keeping control of themselves) on everyone who 
was listening to the message. 
45|The believers who were dedicated to a strict form 
of Judaism[o] who accompanied Peter were flabbergasted because the offering—the 
gift[p]—of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles, those who are not 
Jewish by birth or by conversion: 
46|for they heard them speaking in tongues and 
magnifying God. Then Peter reacted to what had happened, 
47|“Surely water for 
someone to be baptized in can’t be denied to[q] these people, particularly those who 
received the Holy Spirit just like we did?” 
*[a]battalion…Lit: cohort
*[b]constantly praying to God…Lit: asking of [or from] God throughout everything
*[c]on top of which…Lit: in which
*[d]reptiles…Lit: creatures which crawl on the ground
*[e]isn’t kosher…Lit: is profane and unclean. A hendiadys. Profane is something which one should never 
indulge in; unclean is something which you shouldn’t indulge in until it flips back to clean (assuming it 
can or ever does). Also, ref. Rom. 14:14.
*[f]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[g]prostrated himself before him in worship…Lit: fell at the feet and worshipped
*[h]praying just like we pray during the Three-in-the-Afternoon-Prayer-Time…Lit: praying a ninth[-hour 
prayer]. Ninth refers to three in the afternoon. Ref. Acts 3:1.
*[i]really, really floored…Lit: upon a truth overtaken. Upon a truth is an expression. Overtaken is the same 
word rendered John 1:5 take him down.
*[j]who reverence Him and go about doing right are acceptable to Him…Lit: who fear Him and work 
righteousness are acceptable to Him. Also, acceptable to Him means accepted by Him, meaning that He 
accepts them if they were to ask.
*[k]God singled out and specially chose Jesus of Nazareth and put on him…Lit: God anointed Jesus of 
Nazareth
*[l]an oh-so-powerful-dose of the miracle-working power of the Holy Spirit…Lit: the Holy Spirit and power. 
A hendiadys similar to the one in Matt. 3:11; ref. note there.
*[m]wooden cross-beam…Lit: wood [beam]. This is a synecdoche for crucifixion. Ref. 5:30.
*[n]through his authority and what he stands for…Lit: through his name
*[o]the men who were dedicated to a strict form of Judaism…Lit: the faithful from out of circumcision. This 
phrase is an expression which wraps a metonymy. Circumcision is the metonymy; the expression is Jews 
who believe one must adhere strictly to edicts of the Law of Moses. Similar wording as Acts 11:2.
*[p]offering—the gift…Ref. note of 8:20.
*[q]water for someone to be baptized in can’t be denied to…A figure of speech; water here is a synecdoche 
for baptism itself. What he means is, baptism can’t be denied to…
*[r]by the authority of…Lit: in the name of

*[A]From (the Roman Province of) Italia…Lit: [from] Italia. The Gk. word Italia in the ablative case; hence 
the insertion of from. Just like Waffen-SS divisions had names given to them, and some American 
divisions have nicknames, in the same way this battalion was given a name. It’s reasonable to assume 
that all the soldiers in this battalion were conscripted from the Roman province of Italia.
*[B]a devout Gentile who was a sympathizer and near-convert to Judaism…Lit: pious and fearing God [a 
God-fearer]. God-fearers were Gentiles who followed Jewish practices but weren’t converts to Judaism.
*[C]have percolated upwards to where they’ve garnered God’s attention, and He’s quite pleased by what 
He sees…Lit: have ascended for a memorial before God. This literal wording is taken from Lev. 2:2; 
Therefore, OT offerings such as the gift offerings of Lev. 2 are a metaphor for Cornelius’s prayers and 
alms. The metaphor made a few times in the NT (2 Cor. 2:15; Eph. 5:2; Heb. 13:15; etc.) compares 
Christian duty to the aroma that went up in the smoke in the burning of OT offerings. The way it is 
presented, God left commandments in the OT for His people to burn offerings, then way up in the sky 
sniffs the air for the smell of the sacrifices being burned as He commanded, and is pleased when He 
smells them.
Also, the fact that this angel spoke to Cornelius using an OT metaphor means that Cornelius must’ve 
known the OT pretty well, or he wouldn’t have understood what the angel was saying.
*[D]back deck…Lit: the rooftop. Some liberties taken. Houses in that time and in that part of the world 
used their rooftops the same way we use back decks, and they had ladders or stairways which led up to 
them. A rooftop provided privacy from the confines of the house (ref. Prov. 25:24), and one presumes 
that Peter sought such privacy for prayer. Peter got a whiff of the smoke from the midday meal, he was 
hungry already, and it distracted him. God used this distraction as a vehicle to teach him something 
new.
*[E]the thing which God has purged of its non-kosher-ness is permissible for you to eat…Lit: that which God 
has cleaned is not profane [for] you. The kosher laws are listed in the Law Moses in chapters such as Lev. 
11. Various creatures are specified to be clean or not clean, and if clean, permissible to eat. However, 
there are other passages in the Law of Moses where a person, for example, will be unclean for a while, 
but then can purge the uncleanness from himself and thereby become clean again. Verse 14 here 
alludes to this concept.
The vision came to Peter when he was hungry and the vision was concerning food—at least superficially. 
In a broader sense, it was redefining what is and isn’t permissible for Peter to do, according to Jewish 
beliefs, and the lifting of the ban on non-kosher foods is applicable to the lifting of the ban on Gentiles 
themselves. And—incidentally—this is one of a few NT passages which teaches that Christians are not 
subject to certain taboos enumerated in the Law of Moses.
*[F]all of us are on the edge of our seats waiting…Lit: we all exist before God. This appears to be an idiom; 
it’s not entirely certain if this rendering is correct. In fact, some manuscripts have been redacted to 
change the wording here so this verse reads, we’re present here before you.
[G]healing all who were being oppressed by the devil…The Gk. word used for healing here iaomai 
(ἰάομαι/Strong’s 2390) refers specifically to physical healing; Luke selected this word over the all-
encompassing Gk. word for healing therapeuō (θεραπεύω /Strong’s 2323), which generally means 
treated and can and often does encompass more than physical healing; in the NT, therapeuō is generally 
preferred over iaomai when describing the treating of a person who’s demon-possessed (i.e., casting the 
demon out). The point being made is that this is another instance in the NT where physical sickness is 
said to be an oppression of the devil. If this is so, how can sickness be a means which God uses to teach 
people something?

Acts
*[G]healing all who were being oppressed by the devil…The Gk. word used for healing here iaomai 
(ἰάομαι/Strong’s 2390) refers specifically to physical healing; Luke selected this word over the all-
encompassing Gk. word for healing therapeuō (θεραπεύω /Strong’s 2323), which generally means 
treated and can and often does encompass more than physical healing; in the NT, therapeuō is generally 
preferred over iaomai when describing the treating of a person who’s demon-possessed (i.e., casting the 
demon out). The point being made is that this is another instance in the NT where physical sickness is 
said to be an oppression of the devil. If this is so, how can sickness be a means which God uses to teach 
people something?

Acts
48|He commanded that they be baptized 
by the authority of[r] of Jesus Christ. After that, they asked him to stay for several days.


&ACTS 11
1|Now the apostles and comrades[a] over in Judea heard that the Gentiles too 
and not just the Jews had whole-heartedly embraced and acted upon[b] God's word, God’s 
system of logic. 
2|When Peter went over to Jerusalem, the believers who adhered to 
Judaism strictly[c] proceeded to show that they had misgivings about what he did and 
questioned what he did: 
3|“You went into a house that has those outside of Judaism[d] 
in it and shared a meal with them.”
          
4|Peter proceeded to explain to them what happened, explaining it in sequential 
order: 
5|“I was in Joppa praying and had a vision while in a trance: the vision was of an 
object something like a huge, four-cornered cloth sheet descending out of the sky, and it 
came as far as me and stopped. 
6|I stared at it and started to notice what was there: I 
saw the gamut of four-footed animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds from the sky. 

7|Along with it, I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get to it, Peter: slaughter and eat them.’ 

8|But I said, ‘No way, sir, since nothing which isn’t kosher has ever entered my 
mouth.’ 
9|A second time a voice from the sky spoke in reply, ‘That which God has 
purged of its non-kosher-ness is permissible for you to eat.’ 
10|This happened a third 
time, and the objects in the vision were taken back up into the sky again. 
11|Just like 
that, three men stopped at the house which I was staying, men sent as messengers[A] 
from Cornelius to me. 
12|The Spirit told me to have no doubts or reservations and 
go introduce myself to them. Some of the comrades—these fellows here—also 
accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.
          
13|”He reported how he saw an angel in his house, and the angel stood 
there and said, ‘Send messengers to Joppa and send for Simon who goes by Peter, 

14|who’ll speak to you and tell you things by which you will be rescued from your 
spiritual malaise[e], you and your entire household[B].’ 
15|While I was just getting 
started talking, the baptism in the Holy Spirit fell on them just like it did on us too way-
back-when. 
16|But I remembered the Lord’s sayings, as he kept on telling us, ‘Sure, 
John baptized with water, but you all will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 
17|So 
now, if God gave the same exact offering—gift—to them as He gave to us too, to believe 
in[f] the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God’s way[g]?” 
18|After hearing 
this, they fell silent and glorified God saying, “Then that means that God also granted the 
Gentiles the Complete-Changeover which leads to[h] that special fullness of life.”
          
19|So now, those who were scattered because of the pressure due to the 
persecution that occurred upon Stephen’s stoning spread out as far as Phoenicia, 
Cyprus, and Antioch telling the Concept to Jews alone. 
20|Among them were some 
men from Cyprus and Cyrene, men in particular who went to Antioch and were talking 
and talking to the Greek-speaking Jews, telling them the good news—the Gospel—of 
the Lord Jesus. 
21|The Lord was supernaturally and spectacularly working behind 
the scenes in conjunction with them[i], and consequently there were many people who 
believed and turned to the Lord.
          
22|The whole story was heard by the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and 
they dispatched Barnabas, who passed through the region until he got to Antioch. 

23|Once he got there and got to see the manifestation of God’s grace, rejoiced. 
Because he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit, and faithful, he advised, 
encouraged, and in every way helped[C] them all with a heartfelt determination to stick 
with it until the Lord comes back. 
24|[j] —And a good-many people were added to 
the Lord. 
25|He left for Tarsus to hunt Saul down, 
26|and once he found him 
brought him to Antioch. As things turned out in their case, they got together in the 
church for a whole year and taught a good number of people, and as a result the 
disciples were first referred to as “Christians[D]” in Antioch.
          
27|During this timeframe, prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch. 

28|One of them by the name of Agabus stood up and through the Spirit portended 
that a huge famine over the entire civilized world[E] was going to occur, which 
happened during the Roman Emperor Claudius’s reign. 
29|The disciples reacted in 
such a way that what came out of them was that each one of them, as far as he had the 
means to do so, determined to send a ministry-gift to the comrades living in Judea. 

*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]whole-heartedly embraced and acted upon…Lit: received
*[c]they who adhere to Judaism strictly…Lit: they from out of circumcision. The phrase they from out of 
circumcision is an abbreviated form of the faithful from out of circumcision, which appears in Acts 10:45.
*[d]those outside of Judaism…Lit: uncircumcised
*[e]by which you will be rescued you from your spiritual malaise…Lit: by which you will be saved
*[f]in…Lit: upon
*[g]who was I to stand in God’s way…Lit: was I somebody who could block God?
*[h]Complete-Changeover which leads to…Lit: repentance to
*[i]The Lord was supernaturally and spectacularly working behind the scenes in conjunction with them…Lit: 
the Lord’s hand was with them. An expression found throughout the Bible.
*[j]first part of v. 24 moved to v. 23.
*[k]using Barnabas and Saul as couriers…Lit: through the hand of Barnabas and Saul

*[A]men sent as messengers…The participle used here is the root word for apostle. The usage here 
provides insight into what an apostle is.
*[B]you and your entire household…Some have taken this (along with Acts 16:15,31,33; Acts 18:8) to be a 
promise that God will cause your immediate family to become believers if you simply have faith in that 
promise. This is a principle, not a promise. The principle is that those who submit to and follow you in 
natural affairs will do the same with spiritual affairs; if a person submits his will to another, it will carry 
over into spiritual things also. Cornelius was the head of his household, which included his family, his 
relatives that were living with him, and his servants, and his household were following his spiritual lead 
(Acts 10:27) before Peter arrived. The literal wording of Acts 16:33b confirms this; the entire half-verse 
says, “He himself was baptized and all they of his immediately”; the confirming phrase is “all they of 
his.”
*[C]advised, encouraged, and in every way helped…This is the verb from which the well-known Gk. word 
paraklātos (παράκλητος/Strong’s 3875) is derived. Ref. note of Acts 4:36. This passage demonstrates 
what the “the Son of Encouragement” (Acts 4:36, NASB) is all about. In the role of Son of 
Encouragement , Barnabas had a knack for knowing who was needed, where and when they were 
needed, and this urged him to bring Paul to Antioch (v. 26). In the rift between Barnabas and Paul in 
Acts 16:36–41, Barnabas’s instincts derived from his gift of Encouragement caused him to stand against 
Paul on John-Mark’s behalf. His instincts were later vindicated as some of Paul’s last words, spoken in 2 
Tim. 4:11, attested to Mark’s faithfulness.
*[D]Christians…It’s insinuated that the renaming of the disciples as Christians was a result of Barnabas’s 
and Paul’s teaching, just after Cornelius’s conversion, who was the first Gentile to become a believer. 
We can deduce that Paul at this time was teaching that a non-Jew could become a believer, and this 
new teaching was the crux of this new movement called “Christianity.” Therefore, technically-speaking, 
a Christian is one who circumvented Judaism and became a believer directly, as opposed to a person 
who’s a part of “the Way,” which is a Jew who becomes a believer in Jesus (ref. Acts 9:2). Consequently, 
in terms of technicalities, it is not possible for a Jew to become a Christian; a Jew who believes in Jesus 
the same way that a Christian does becomes a part of the Way, and not a Christian. A Jew can be a 
genuine believer in Jesus and not renounce his Judaism.
*[E]the entire civilized world…Or: the entire inhabited world. Assumption is that Luke was principally 
speaking of the Roman Empire.
[F]the presiding board, the leaders of the church in Jerusalem…Lit: the elders. In the early days of 
Christianity, passages such as these indicate that the churches were led similar to the way synagogues 
were: they were led by a board of elders. To claim that, according to the Bible, the only true and proper 
model for governing a church is that the church be headed by one and only one person fails to reconcile 
verses like this.

Acts
30|They did just that and sent the money they collected to the presiding board, the 
leaders of the church in Jerusalem[F], using Barnabas and Saul as couriers[k].


&ACTS 12
1|About that time, King Herod seized[a] a few people who belonged to the 
church in order to mistreat them badly. 
2|He killed John’s brother James with a 
sword. 
3|Seeing how pleasing this was to the Judeans, he proceeded to take it a step 
further and apprehend Peter too (it was around Passover), 
4|whom he arrested and 
put in jail, putting him in the custody of four squads (a squad consisting of four men) of 
soldiers who would guard him, intending to haul him up before the folk-people[b] after 
the Passover. 
5|So now, Peter was being kept in jail; the church continued praying 
fervently to God for him.
          
6|When Herod was about to lead him forth to his death, Peter was sleeping that 
night between two soldiers, chained up with two chains[A]. In addition to that, two 
soldiers were guarding the door. 
7|Out of nowhere, an angel went up to him and a 
light shined in the cell. He tapped Peter’s chest and woke him up saying,
      “Get up—quickly now!”
      His chains fell from his arms.
          
8|The angel told him, “Put your shirt and pants on[c] and put your sandals on.” 
He did just that.
      He then says to him, “Put your jacket[d] on and follow me.”
          
9|Once he left the prison, he followed him, but because of the angel he didn’t 
know that what was happening was for real; he kept on thinking that he was having a 
dream. 
10|After passing through the night watchmen’s first checkpoint and 
through the second[e], they went to the Iron Gate, the gate people use when carrying 
things into the city. That very gate opened automatically itself for them, and after they 
left the city, they went down one narrow street and immediately the angel left him. 

11|Peter came to his senses and said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord sent 
one of his angels and delivered me from Herod’s clutches and from all that awaited me 
from the Judean folk-people.” 
12|Realising where he was, he went to Mary’s house 
(Mary the mother of John, who goes by “Mark[B]”), where a good number of people 
were gathered praying.
          
13|He knocked on the outer courtyard door and a girl[f] named Rhoda went 
to answer it. 
14|Recognizing Peter’s voice, out of joy she didn’t open the door but 
ran in and announced that Peter’s standing at the door. 
15|They told her, “You’re 
crazy,” but she kept on insisting that it’s so. They kept on telling her, “It’s his 
messenger[g],” 
16|but Peter stayed there knocking, so they opened the door, saw 
him, and just lost it. 
17|He motioned with his hand to get them to quiet down and 
began to explain how the Lord led him out of the prison; in addition, he told them, “Go 
out and tell these things to James and his brothers.” He left and went to some other 
place.
          
18|When daylight came, no small amount of commotion took place among 
the soldiers: what exactly[h] happened to Peter? 
19|Herod looked for him and upon 
not finding him interrogated the guards and ordered that they be taken away and 
executed and left Judea for Caesarea and proceeded to spend time there.
          
20|Now he was furious with Tyre and Sidon; but in the solidarity of a unified 
front, they approached him and, once they won the king’s chamberlain Blastus over to 
their side, kept begging for peace on account of their country being fed out of the king’s 
grain silos. 
21|On a prearranged date, Herod, fully clothed in his regal apparel and 
presiding in his official capacity as judge[i], proceeded to address them. 
22|The 
populace kept shouting out, “We’re hearing a god’s voice and not a human voice!” 

23|Immediately an angel struck him in retaliation for not coming clean and telling 
the truth[j] by letting that remark slide, and he wound up[B] being eaten by worms and 
breathed his last.
          
24|The Word of God kept on growing and multiplying. 
*[a]seized…Lit: he laid the hands
*[b]haul him up before the folk-people…Lit: take him up with the people
*[c]Put your shirt and pants on…Or perhaps: put your undergarments [or underwear] on. Lit: gird your 
loins. Some liberties taken. Also, gird your loins is a biblical idiom which means “get ready to roll” or “get 
ready for action.”
*[d]jacket…Lit: cloak. Some liberties taken.
*[e]night watchmen’s first checkpoint and through the second…Or: the first of night watchmen and the 
second
*[f]girl…Or: servant-girl
*[g]his messenger…Or perhaps: his angel. The text is ambiguous. If it is his angel, that would be facetious, 
and in this case we would instead say his ghost.
*[h]what exactly…Lit: what therefore
*[i]presiding in his official capacity as judge…Lit: seated on his judgment seat
*[j]coming clean and telling the truth…Lit: he didn’t give God the glory. An idiom; ref. note of John 9:24.

*[A]chained up with two chains…Probably chained to both guards
*[B]wound up…Lit: became. It’s unlikely that he was eaten by worms immediately, the moment he was still 
in the middle of speaking, but, while the wording in the GT indicates that this was his fate, it doesn’t say 
that it happened instantly.
[C]Mark…The same Mark who wrote the Gospel of Mark. Also referred to as John-Mark. Also, some 
scholars believe that this house was the same building where the upper room was used for both the Last 
Supper and where the 120 were gathered on Pentecost.

Acts
25|Having 
fulfilled their mission, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem and took along with 
them John who goes by Mark[C]. 


&ACTS 13
1|Now there were prophets and teachers interspersed throughout the church 
in Antioch: Barnabas, Simeon who goes by Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian; Manaen a 
close, boyhood friend (might’ve even been a foster brother) of the tetrarch Herod, and 
Saul. 
2|While worshipping the Lord in worship services and while fasting, the Holy 
Spirit told them, “Consecrate Barnabas and Saul to the work that I have called them.” 

3|Then, after fasting, praying, and laying hands on them, they turned them loose.
          
4|So then they, having been dispatched by the Holy Spirit, went over to 
Seleucia, and from there sailed out to Cyprus. 
5|When they wound up in Salamis, 
they proclaimed God’s word in the Jews’ synagogues. Now he had Mark[a] around to run 
errands for him and to help with odds-and-ends.
          
6|After they went through the entire island all the way to Paphos, they ran 
across a particular man, a sorcerer/false-prophet Jew who adopted the name “Joshua-
2.0[A],” 
7|an associate of the intelligent, quick-witted Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus. 
This fellow Sergius Paulus[B] summoned Barnabas and Saul, seeking to hear all about 
God’s word. 
8|The sorcerer Elymas (that’s the way his name—Joshua-2.0’s name, that 
is[B]—is translated), though, opposed them, trying to distort the message, steering the 
proconsul away from the faith. 
9|But Saul (which is also “Paul”[C]), being full of the 
Holy Spirit, glared at him 
10|and said, “Oh, aren’t you full of all kinds of 
deception, trickery, and unscrupulousness, you spitting image of the devil, you enemy 
of any shape or form of righteousness?[b]—You won’t pause for a moment in your 
turning people away by your distortion of the Lord’s Straightforward Ways. 
11|See 
here: a supernatural working of the Lord’s power will assail you[c] right this moment, 
and you’ll become blind—not even able to see the sun—for a duration of time”—and 
immediately a total loss of sight to where everything went completely dark[d] was 
imposed upon him[e], and he began to go around trying to find a blind-man’s guide to 
lead him about by the hand. 
12|Upon seeing what had happened, the proconsul 
then believed, astonished at the lesson that the Lord taught Elymas.
          
13|Paul and the band which surrounded him put out to sea at Paphos and 
went to Perga, Pamphylia. Mark, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem. 

14|For their part, though, starting at Perga, they cut across and arrived in Antioch-
Pasidia, and attended a synagogue meeting on the Sabbath, introduced themselves, and 
took a seat. 
15|After the bringing-out of the Old Testament scrolls[f], the synagogue 
heads sent them a message, “Men, comrades, if any one of you has an encouraging 
word[D] for the folk-people, speak up.” 
16|Paul stood up, gestured with his hand, 
and said:
      “Men, Israelites, and Gentile sympathizers to Judaism[g], listen to what I have to 
say. 
17|The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and brought them to 
prominence[h] in the temporary stay in Egypt, and by a supernatural intervention in the 
affairs of mankind[i] brought them out of there 
18|and tolerated them for about 
forty years in the wilderness. 
19|After destroying seven nations in Canaan, he took 
possession of their land, 
20|occupying it for about 450 years. After this, He 
designated ad-hoc rulers[j] until the prophet Samuel came on the scene. 
21|And then 
they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the clan[k] of 
Benjamin, for forty years. 
22|Once he was removed, He brought David to 
prominence, making him their king. He went on record and said about him, ‘I found 
David son of Jesse, a man after My heart, one who does everything I ever wanted.’ 

23|From out of this fellow’s lineal descendants God brought Israel to a savior 
named Jesus, according to what had been promised, 
24|John having preached 
ahead of time, before Jesus came on the scene, a baptism, an initiation ceremony of a 
change of heart and of ways[l], to all the people of Israel. 
25|But as John crossed the 
finish line[m] and his ministry was waning, he kept on saying, ‘What do you all suppose 
that I am? I am not the One—No—get ahold of this: he who comes after me—I am not 
worthy to take his sandal off.’
          
26|”Men, comrades, descendants of Abraham’s line, and those Gentiles 
among you who are Jewish sympathizers: the message of this rescue-plan rescuing you 
from your spiritual malaise[n] has been sent out to you. 
27|The fact is, those who live 
in Jerusalem along with their rulers, not acknowledging this and the voices of the 
prophets which are read aloud every Sabbath, finished coming to a verdict, 

28|and—without a single one of them finding a reason for the death penalty—
asked Pilate to kill Jesus. 
29|Just as all the things noted about him in the Scriptures 
were fulfilled, they took him down off the wooden cross-beam[o] and put him in a tomb— 

30|But God resurrected him from the dead, 
31|the one who for many days 
was seen by those who accompanied him from Galilee to Jerusalem, by the very people 
who are declaring to the folk-people that this is indeed factual. 
32|And we are 
delivering the good news to you all, that what was promised to the forefathers has 
occurred, 
33|because God has fulfilled this among us the descendants, having 
resurrected Jesus, as there is also a verse in the second Psalms which reads:

“You are My son:
I have begotten you today


34|”Since He resurrected him from the dead, he’s not going to be returning to 
bodily decomposition[p] ever again. This has resulted in the following being the case:

“I will give you David’s holy things[q], his guaranteed things


35|”Consequently, there’s another place where it says:

“You will not destine[r] Your Holy-One[q]
To undergo bodily decomposition


36|”Indeed, when his own generation was alive, David attended to the will of God 
and expired[s] and went to be with his ancestors and underwent decomposition, 

37|but the one whom God raised from the dead didn’t undergo decomposition. 

38|So now, let it be known, men, comrades, that through this resurrection 
forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you—forgiveness of everything which you 
have not been justified in doing by the Law of Moses. 
39|By this resurrection, 
everyone who believes is justified. 
40|So see to it that what’s been spoken by the 
Old Testament prophets not get the better of you[t]:


41|”Here they are, the cynics and the scoffers:
Gape at them for a moment and then vanish,
Because I’m doing something special in your lifetime[u].
There’s no way at all that you would believe what I’m up to,
Even if someone were to describe it to you.”

          
42|While they were saying goodbye, they kept pleading with him to speak 
to them on the following Sabbath, to talk some more about what was said. 
43|Once 
they were dismissed from the synagogue service, many of the Jews and the devout 
proselytes to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas. While certain ones of them in 
particular were speaking face-to-face with them, Paul and Barnabas kept on persuading 
them to continue in the grace of God.
          
44|On the following Sabbath, almost the entire city gathered together to 
hear the Word of the Lord. 
45|Seeing how many were in the crowd, the Jews were 
filled with envy and proceeded to say things in opposition to what was spoken by Paul, 
contradicting him and blaspheming him, 
46|and so Paul and Barnabas, speaking to 
the wider audience, said, “It was necessary to speak the Word of God to you first, but 
since you reject it and render yourselves unworthy of that special fullness of life[E] 
(eternal life), take note: I’m turning to the Gentiles. 
47|You see, the Lord has given 
you commands to follow like this:

“I have positioned you Jews
To be a light for Gentile nations,
In order that you be a means of rescue and refuge
To the furthest reaches of the planet.”


48|Hearing this, the Gentiles proceeded to rejoice and to glorify the Word of the 
Lord, and the very ones who were appointed to eternal life believed[E].
          
49|Now the Word of the Lord kept on being spread throughout the whole 
country. 
50|The Jews incited the pious women, the ones who were prominent and 
who were leaders in the city, fomented a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and 
kicked them out of their district. 
51|They wiped their hands of it[v] and went to 
Iconium, 
*[a]Mark…Lit: John. Some liberties taken.
*[b]Oh, aren’t you full of all kinds of deception, trickery, and unscrupulousness, you spitting image of the 
devil, you enemy of any shape or form of righteousness?…Lit: Oh, full of all deceit and all 
unscrupulousness, devil’s son, enemy of all righteousness? Full of all deceit, etc. is a figure of speech (ref. 
Matt. 4:23).
*[c]a supernatural working of the Lord’s power will assail you…Lit: a hand of the Lord upon you
*[d]a total loss of sight to where everything went completely dark…Lit: dimness and darkness. A hendiadys; 
ref. note of Matt. 3:11.

expression.

*[n]rescue-plan, rescuing you from your spiritual malaise …Lit: salvation
*[o]the wooden cross-beam…Lit: the wood. A synecdoche for the cross; ref. note of Acts 5:30.
*[p]bodily decomposition…Or: decay. A synecdoche for death, one taken from the OT in the quotation in v. 
35. When Paul uses this word in v. 34, he’s thinking ahead about the OT verse which he quotes in v. 35.
*[q]holy things…Holy-One…Plural and singular forms of the same word. Since the word itself is uncommon, 
Paul appears to be associating the two OT quotations, and that’s why he begins v. 35 with the word 
therefore. In other words, one of the things referred to by “David’s holy things” in v. 34 is the “Holy-
One” (Jesus) in v. 35.
*[r]destine…Lit: grant [or perhaps, allow]
*[s]expired…Lit: fell asleep. A NT expression.
*[t]get the better of you…Lit: come upon you. A well-known biblical expression.
*[u]because I’m doing something special in your lifetime…Lit: I am working a work in your days. Working a 
work is a figure of speech, emphasizing that the work is something special, unusual, and to be 
anticipated.
*[v]wiped their hands of it…Lit: shook the dust off their feet. This is an expression; it’s questionable—
doubtful—whether Paul and Barnabas actually did this. Ref. Matt. 10:14; Mark 6:11.
*[w]a Holy-Spirit-fueled-joy…Lit: joy and the Holy Spirit. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.

*[A]Joshua-2.0…[2.0 is two-point-oh, a remake of the original]…Lit: Bar-Joshua [which some render Bar-
Jesus]. Bar is the Hebrew prefix for son of. It’s unlikely that he knew anything about Jesus, so Bar-Joshua 
is the logical choice over Bar-Jesus. By the sounds of his name, he fancied himself as another Joshua, 
one who assumes the leadership of the people and takes them into the Promised Land.
*[B]This fellow Sergius Paulus…Lit: This fellow. The context suggests that this fellow refers to Sergius 
Paulus, not Bar-Joshua, as the grammatical inflections more strongly suggests it refers to Bar-Joshua. 
The conclusion is that Luke should’ve done a better job at resolving this ambiguity and should’ve 
avoided any insinuation that this fellow refers to Bar-Joshua. Along these same lines, in v. 8 the 
interpolation “Joshua-2.0’s name, that is” was added to clarify that Luke means that Bar-Joshau and 
Elymas are not two different people.
*[C]also “Paul”…From here out, Saul is mostly referred to as Paul. Notice how the spelling of Saul and Paul 
differ only by a single consonant; Paul is the Gentile-equivalent of the Jewish name Saul. To give an 
analogy, let’s say there’s a man from Central America with the Spanish name Jaime who’s working in an 
English-speaking company in the U.S. Among his coworkers, he goes by Jimmy, an English-equivalent of 
Jaime. But in the Spanish conversation among his family and friends, he’s still Jaime.
*[D]if any among you has an encouraging word…Paul and Barnabas were strangers attending the 
synagogue for the first time and were asked if they wanted to stand up and speak to the audience, 
which Paul proceeded to do for a few minutes. This was standard practice back then; nowadays, 
churches won’t even invite those who itinerate in their denomination (if there’s any still around) to 
speak at their church for the weekend that the pastor’s on vacation. Pastors these days completely 
monopolize the pulpit only, occasionally throwing out a bone to their obsequious staff underlings, and 
only so they don’t get discouraged and quit…and—after all—who’s going to speak when the pastor’s on 
vacation anyways? Churches claim to faithfully adhere to the practices of the Bible. They do not. In this 
day and age of the abundant availability of information, over the years they have further restricted what 
is spoken in their church instead.
[E]you reject it and render yourself unworthy of that special fullness of life…Lit: you reject it deliver a 
judgment [on] yourselves [as] those unworthy of eternal life. From v. 48, the very ones who were 
appointed to eternal life believed. In the debate between free will and predestination, the two sides of 
the coin are presented in these two verses. Rejecting Christ, an act of their free will, made them 
unworthy of eternal life. Those who rejected Christ were not appointed to eternal life (v. 48). Free will 
and predestination are in harmony with one another, not in opposition.

&ACTS 14
1|In Iconium events occurred along the same lines: they introduced themselves 
to the members of the synagogue and affiliated themselves with it in order to speak 
before the synagogue so that a great many Jews, and not only they but Greek-speaking 
Jews[A], would become believers. 
2|The Jews who weren’t converted to the faith went 
on the offensive against them and polluted the minds of the Gentiles, pitting them 
against the comrades[a]. 
3|So then they stayed a good deal of time speaking openly 
about the Lord, testifying about the message of his grace, allowing miracles[b] to take 
place through their hands. 
          
4|The majority of the population was divided: on the one hand there were 
those of the Jews’ camp; on the other hand there were those of the apostles’ camp. 

5|Spontaneously and impulsively, both the Gentiles and the Jews were joined by their 
rulers and decided to attack them and stone them. 
6|Realizing what was going on, 
they got out of there and fled to the cities of Lycaonian, Lystra and Derbe specifically and 
to the surrounding area. 
7|There they continually shared the good news, the good 
news of the Gospel.
          
8|There was a certain helpless man in Lystra—unable to use his legs—who kept 
on sitting on the ground all the time, lame from the time he was born, one who hadn’t 
walked around even once. 
9|This fellow heard Paul speaking; after Paul stared at him, 
and while staring sees that he has the faith to escape his affliction[c], 
10|he said in a 
loud voice, “Get up on your feet and stand straight up!”—and he proceeded to do just 
that: he sprung up and walked around, 
11|and seeing what Paul did the crowd 
raised their voices in the Lycaonian language saying, “The gods came down to us in the 
form of these men!”— 
12|and they proceeded to call Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul 
“Hermes,” since Paul did most of the talking[d]— 
13|and the priest of Zeus, whose 
temple is situated right before you get to the city, brought bulls and the garlands that 
sacrificial animals are adorned with to the city gates and, joined by the crowds, was itching 
to perform sacrifices.
          
14|When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their 
garments[e] to show how upset they were and rushed out into the crowd yelling, 

15|“Men, why are you doing this? We too are men who experience passion and 
pain the same way you do, while at the same time telling you the good news of turning 
away from these worthless things to a living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, 
and everything along with them, 
16|who in the bygone generations permitted 
people everywhere to go their own way and do their own thing— 
17|and yet He 
didn’t leave them void of evidence[f] pointing to Him being up in heaven doing good 
things and being kind, giving you that sweet rain which makes for productive growing 
seasons[g], the food injecting gladness into your hearts until your hearts are filled to the 
brim[h].” 
18|Saying these things just barely caused the crowd to stop performing 
sacrifices.
          
19|Now Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived, talked the crowd into 
stoning Paul, did just that, and dragged him and dragged him until they got outside the 
city, thinking he was dead. 
20|While his disciples were standing around him in a 
circle, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he left for Derbe accompanied 
by Barnabas, 
21|and after he proclaimed the good news of the Gospel to that city 
and made a decent number of disciples there, returned to Lystra, then to Iconium, and 
then to Antioch, 
22|getting the life-being[i] of the disciples to rely[j] on the Lord, 
encouraging them to stick with the faith and advising them by saying that a lot of 
difficulties and intense pressure[k] will occur and must be endured[l] in order to succeed in 
their life of faith (enter God’s kingdom)[B].
          
23|Now having prayed, combining fasting with the prayer, he went church 
by church and appointed presiding boards[C], and the Lord kept on adding more people 
to those who had already come to believe. 
24|They passed through Pisidia and 
came to Pamphylia, 
25|and after speaking the Word of God in Perga, they went 
down to Attalia. 
26|From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they started the 
trip, and were commended for the mission they accomplished by the grace of God. 

27|After getting there and gathering the church together, they proceeded to report 
what God did, as He was with them on the trip, and to report that He opened a door of 
faith for the Gentiles (i.e. He created an opportunity for the Gentiles to join the faith). 

*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]allowing miracles…Lit: giving [granting] signs and wonders
*[c]escape his affliction…Lit: be saved
*[d]Paul did most of the talking…Lit: Paul was the chief of the word [or Word]
*[e]tore their garments…Ref. Matt. 26:65; Mark 14:63
*[f]void of evidence…Lit: not evidence-less. The double-negative is a figure of speech.
*[g]that sweet rain which makes for good growing seasons…Lit: rains and fruit-bearing seasons. A 
hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[h]the food injecting gladness into your hearts until your hearts are filled to the brim…Lit: in-filling your 
hearts of food and joy. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.

*[j]getting …to rely on…Or: making lean upon; establishing
*[k]difficulties and intense pressures…Lit: tribulations
*[l]will take place and must be endured…Lit: must. The GT’s omission interpolated text is a figure of 
speech.

*[A]Greek-speaking Jews…Lit: Greeks. The assumption (which is not certain) is that these are Jews, not 
Gentiles, as is the case in John 7:35; John 12:20.
*[B]succeed in their life of faith (enter God’s kingdom)…Lit: into-go into[enter] God’s kingdom. This verse is 
key in the assertion that the NT phrase enter God’s kingdom is an idiom. (Being an idiom, perhaps this 
explains the double-use of the word into in the phrase.) In the context here of Acts 14:22, Paul is giving 
advice to those who are already disciples, telling them what they must do to “enter God’s kingdom.” If 
one takes enter God’s kingdom literally, then this makes no sense, since they are already in God’s 
kingdom. It only makes sense if enter God’s kingdom is taken as an idiom.
[C]presiding boards…Lit: elders. Paul did not appoint pastors to rule these churches but committees of 
elders. Though bishops would eventually replace the elders, both forms of church government are 
legitimate, not one or the other. Ref. note of 11:30.

&ACTS 15
1|A few key people came over from Judea and proceeded to tell them how 
things ought to be done, instructing[A] the comrades[a] that you’ve got to be circumcised 
in Moses (i.e. become Jewish and commit to obeying the commandments in the Law of Moses), 
or else you can’t be saved (i.e. receive Christ and walk with him). 
2|No small 
disagreement and debate occurred between Paul and Barnabas on one side and them on 
the other, and they arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and certain others from among them to 
go to the apostles and the presiding board[b] in Jerusalem in regard to this debate. 
3|So 
then those sent forth by the church kept creating tremendous joy among the comrades 
as they were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria recounting the Gentiles’ 
conversion. 
4|Arriving in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, 
and the presiding board, and reported what God was doing in conjunction with them.
          
5|Now a few who belonged to the Pharisee-sect and who had become believers 
stood up to speak and said that the Gentile believers must be circumcised (and thus convert 
to Judaism) and be ordered to adhere to the Law of Moses, 
6|and the apostles and the 
presiding board got together to look into this matter. 
7|After much debate took place, 
Peter stood up and told them:
      “Men, comrades: you understand that from the very start (our start that is), God 
chose that the Gentiles hear the Gospel through my mouth and become believers. 

8|God, the Knower-Of-The-Heart, went on record and told them that He would give 
them the baptism of the Holy Spirit just like He gave it to us. 
9|After their hearts were 
cleansed by faith, no one discriminated against them[c]. 
10|So at this point in time, 
you’re trying God’s patience (testing God) by placing an unnecessary burden on the 
disciples (putting a yoke on the disciples’ necks), one which neither our ancestors nor 
we were strong enough to bear. 
11|No—it’s through the grace of the Lord Jesus 
that one exercises faith to be saved from their sin following the same pattern as those 
people did.”
          
12|The whole lot of them fell silent and began to listen to Barnabas and Paul 
explain the miracles[d] that God did among the Gentiles through them. 
13|After 
their silence, James[B] responded, “Men, comrades, listen to me. 
14|Simon explained 
the way that, for the first time, God paid a visit—a caring, helping type of visit—in 
order to form a unique group of people from out of the Gentiles, a people consecrated to 
everything He represents[C]. 
15|The words of the prophets agree with this, as it’s 
written:


16|”’After this occurs, I will return
And rebuild David’s fallen condo[e]
And rebuild what remains of it
And restore it,

17|So that what’s left of the people
Just might seek out the Lord,
Plus all of the Gentiles upon whom
My mark of ownership[f] was assigned to,’
Says the Lord who’s doing this

18|and Who’s been making this known from eternity past[g].


19|”Therefore I decided not to bother those who are of Gentile origin who are 
turning to God, 
20|but instead to write them letters which tell them to abstain from 
the detestable things forbidden by of the Law of Moses: from things polluted by idols, from 
bizarre sexual immorality[D], and from drinking the blood remaining in the body of an 
animal after it’s been killed by having its neck broken[E]. 
21|You see, going back to 
ancient times, the Law of Moses has always had those who preach it, as it’s being read 
aloud in the synagogues in city after city, Sabbath after Sabbath.”
          
22|Then the apostles and the presiding board in conjunction with the entire 
church decided what was best to do[h] and chose men from among them to send with 
Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, namely Judas, who goes by Barsabbas, and Silas, men 
who were leaders among their comrades, 
23|and wrote a certified letter so there 
would be no doubt of its authenticity[F],
      “The apostles and the presiding board, comrades: to the comrades up and down 
Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, those who are of Gentile origin. Greetings[i]! 
24|Because 
we heard that some of our own people have of their own initiative ventured out and 
troubled you with remarks unsettling to your mind[j], people who have not been issued 
instructions to do so, 
25|all of us were in agreement in deciding what was best to do 
and chose comrades to send you who will accompany our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 

26|men who have dedicated their lives to[k] to all that our Lord Jesus Christ stands 
for[l]. 
27|So we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same as what is 
written here through word-of-mouth. 
28|The fact is, the Holy Spirit and we thought 
it best not to make you shoulder any more burden[m] than these items which we’re listing 
here, which are absolutely necessary: 
29|abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from 
slaughtering an animal with the intent of drinking its blood, and from bizarre sexual 
immorality.”
          
30|So then, once they were released[G], they went up to Antioch, gathered 
the community of believers together, and gave them the letter. 
31|After it was read 
they rejoiced at the advice, exhortation, and encouragement. 
32|Judas and Silas as 
well exhorted and encouraged the comrades by means of many short prophetic 
messages[n] (they being prophets in their own right) and put them on a firm footing[o]. 

33|After putting in time there, they were released[G] in good standing[H] from the 
comrades back to the ones who sent them.
34|[I] 
35|Paul and Barnabas 
continued on in Antioch teaching and evangelizing the Word of the Lord, and many 
others did too.
          
36|After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return to the cities in 
which we proclaimed the word of the Lord and go from city to city visiting the 
comrades there and see how they’re getting on in their faith.” 
37|Now Barnabas 
was wanting to take Mark (i.e. John who goes by Mark) along with them too, 

38|but Paul was thinking it fitting not to take Mark along, the guy who deserted 
them, leaving them at Pamphylia and ceasing to accompany them on their mission. 

39|A sharp disagreement took place to the point where they parted ways from 
each other, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus. 
40|Paul called on Silas 
to accompany him and left, after being handed over to the Lord’s grace for safe keeping by 
the comrades. 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]presiding board…Lit: elders
*[c]no one discriminated against them…Lit: no one discriminated between us and them, or, no one made a 
distinction between us and them
*[d]miracles…Lit: signs and wonders
*[e]condo…Lit: tent [tabernacle]. Liberties taken. Ref. note of Luke 16:9.
*[f]My mark of ownership…Lit: My name. Similar to, “And I will write my God’s name upon him,” from Rev. 
3:12.
*[g]and who’s been making this known from eternity past…The principle manuscripts differ for this verse.
*[h]decided what was best to do…Lit: thought [it right]
*[i]Greetings…Lit: To be rejoicing. Standard introductory remark for letters back then.
*[j]mind…Lit: soul
*[k]dedicated their lives to…Lit: given their lives over to on behalf of
*[l]all that our Lord Jesus Christ stands for…Lit: the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
*[m]make you shoulder any more burden…Lit: place much on your neck. The metaphor of placing a yoke, 
and thereby a load to pull, on an oxen. This metaphor is used here and there throughout the NT, and in 
fact is used in v. 10.
*[n]short prophetic messages…Lit: words. The usage of words in v. 32 should be applied to understanding 
what word means in the phrases word of wisdom, word of knowledge, and prophecy found in 1 Cor. 
12:8.
*[o]putting the churches on a firm footing…Same Gk. word used in Acts. 14:22 (ref. note there), which is 
rendered rely on the Lord.

*[A]tell them how things ought to be done, instructing…Lit: teach [Gk: didaskō (διδάσκω/Strong’s 1321)]. 
Didaskō, while normally translated teach, has the additional meaning of instructing a person on how he 
should conduct his life, as it does in v. 1 here, and also in 1 Tim. 2:12, where Paul says that a woman 
shouldn’t teach a man (i.e., tell a man how to conduct his life).
*[B]James…Verse 13 quietly introduces James the brother of Jesus, the context insinuating that he’s the 
head of the church in Jerusalem and also that the Jerusalem church consists solely of practicing Jews 
who believe in Jesus.
*[C]for the first time, God paid a visit—a caring, helping type of visit—in order to form a unique group of 
people from out of the Gentiles, a people consecrated to everything He represents…Lit: God visited to 
receive a people to His name out of Gentiles. The wording that James speaks with here in v. 14 are 
phrases, expressions, idioms, etc. plucked out of the OT. Since this is a snippet of conversational speech 
and is impromptu, we deduce that James spoke this way all the time, his speech heavily seasoned with 
OT phraseology. Since he grew up with Jesus, Jesus spoke the same way also. Or perhaps he picked up 
the habit from Jesus himself.
*[D]bizarre sexual immorality…Lit: fornication. This is a reference to the prohibitions in Lev. 18:6–23, 
sexual practices that even the world, jaded as it sometimes is, generally disdains. Both the usage of the 
word fornication here and the usage in 1 Cor. 5:1 refer to extreme practices. In the NT, the Gk. word for 
prostitute is the female form of fornicator, and keep in mind that a lot, if not most, prostitutes were 
temple prostitutes and fornication was combined with the pagan cult rituals. A preponderance of 
evidence indicates that the NT word for fornication implies something more severe than simply shacking 
up with your fiancée a few months before getting married, which is commonplace in the West 
nowadays.
*[E]drinking the blood remaining in the body of an animal after it’s been killed by having its neck 
broken…Lit: the strangled and the blood. A figure of speech, apparently: an expression built out of a 
hendiadys. This apparently refers to the practice of slaughtering an animal in such a way that no blood is 
spilled, so none of the blood is spilled and wasted, preserving more blood to be drunk.
*[F]certified letter so there would be no doubt of its authenticity…Lit: having been written from a hand of 
theirs. This appears to be an idiom. The idiom helps explain Gal. 6:11.
*[G]released…One might have expected the word departed to be used instead of released, a word which is 
used twice, once in v. 30 and again in v. 33. The context together with the choice of this word seems to 
insinuate that Paul and Barnabas’s bed and board was provided by some other party, whoever was 
hosting them at the moment. When they were “released,” the hosts were relieved of the responsibility 
of providing for them. In v. 33, they were released back to the ones who sent them, means that the ones 
who sent them were to start providing meals for them. Here and there in his epistles, Paul addresses the 
support which he receives (or doesn’t receive) from his hosts; 1 Cor. 9:11 is one example. The support of 
ministers of the Gospel has been a thorny issue from the inception of Christianity, and not only that but 
in the OT as well in regard to Priests and Levites. Suffice to say that congregations, like the example in 
vv. 30,33 here, should assume the responsibility of providing for the pastor or pastors who lead their 
congregation and furthermore for the itinerating speakers who speak at their church. Like this passage 
here in Acts, congregations should take ownership of that responsibility rather than the pastor having to 
force the issue.
*[H]in good standing…Lit: with peace. The word peace in this context has an idiomatic meaning. Ref. usage 
of peace in Matt. 10:12,13. The word peace here means not only that they left in good standing but the 
folks they were visiting weren’t anxious to get rid of them because they were annoying, nettlesome, or a 
burden, but rather felt sorry when they left.

41|He went on and on passing through Syria putting the churches 
on a firm footing[o].


&ACTS 16
1|Paul arrived in Derbe and then in Lystra and stumbled across a particular 
disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer in Christ 
but whose father was a Greek-speaking westerner, 
2|whose good reputation was 
attested to by the comrades[a] in Lystra and Iconium. 
3|Paul wanted this fellow to 
leave with him, and took him to get circumcised (symbolizing his conversion to Judaism 
and the beginning of his obeying the Law of Moses) because of the Jews that were in that 
locale. You see, they all knew that he had a father who was a westerner. 
4|As they 
were travelling through the cities, they committed themselves to keeping an eye on the 
issues that had been decided by the apostles and the presiding board[b] in Jerusalem. 

5|So then the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in 
number day by day.
          
6|After passing through Phrygia and the province of Galatia, they were 
prevented from speaking[c] the Word by the Holy Spirit in the Roman province of Asia, in 
which Phrygia is located and which borders Galatia. 
7|After they went over[d] to Mysia, 
they kept on trying[e] to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus didn’t allow them to. 

8|After making an appearance in Mysia, they went over to Troas. 
9|A vision was 
seen by Paul over the course of a night: some Macedonian man stood planted in one 
place begging him, “Cut across the Aegean Sea to Macedonia and help us out.” 

10|Like he saw in the vision, we[A] immediately sought to depart for Macedonia 
surmising that God had summoned us there to evangelize them.
          
11|They sailed from Troas straight to Samothrace, and the next day to 
Neapolis, 
12|and from there to Philippi, which is a leading colony-city in that part 
of Macedonia. We were keeping at it in this city for a number of days, 
13|and on 
the Sabbath we went out the city gates and down by the river, figuring it would be a 
good place to pray. We sat down and proceeded to speak to the women who had formed 
a group there[B]. 
14|A particular woman named Lydia, a dealer in luxurious cloth[f], 
a Thyatirian sympathizer and near-convert to Judaism[g], was listening and listening, as 
the Lord opened her heart to heed what was being spoken by Paul. 
15|As she was 
baptized (and her household was too), she asked earnestly, “If you’ve come to the 
conclusion that I’m faithful to the Lord, come stay at my house,” and she wouldn’t take 
“no” for an answer[h].
          
16|Now it so happened as they were going to a prayer meeting, that some 
teenage servant-girl who had a spirit of divination accosted them, one who brought her 
bosses[i] a hefty sum of money by telling fortunes. 
17|She followed Paul around 
and kept on yelling, “These men are servants of the Most High God, ones who are 
proclaiming what you need to do to set things right with God[j],” about them, 

18|and she kept this up for several days. Paul, exasperated[C], turned to the spirit 
and said, “By the authority vested in me by Jesus Christ[k], I command you to leave 
her!”—and it left her that moment. 
19|Seeing that any hope of generating income 
departed when the spirit departed, her bosses seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to 
the main town square to where the rulers were. 
20|They brought them to the 
magistrates and said, “These here men are agitating our city, seeing that they’re Jews. 

21|They proclaim—impose upon us—sets of rules which are impermissible for us 
to embrace, seeing that we’re Romans.” 
22|The crowd joined in on attacking them. 
The magistrates flew off the handle[D] and ordered them to be beaten with rods, 

23|and after wounding them with many blows threw them in jail and ordered the 
jail keeper to lock them up tightly, 
24|who, once he received such a stern order, 
shuttled them deep inside the jail and put their legs in stocks.
          
25|Towards the middle of the night while Paul and Silas were praying, they 
kept on singing praises to God (and the prisoners kept hearing from them). 
26|A 
severe earthquake took place suddenly, one of such a magnitude that it shook the 
foundation of the jailhouse, and immediately all the doors were opened, and all of the 
stocks, chains, and fetters were unfastened. 
27|The jail keeper was awakened, and 
seeing all the jail’s doors opened, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, 
thinking that all the prisoners had escaped, 
28|but Paul called out to him in a loud 
voice, “Don’t hurt yourself; we’re all still here, you see.” 
29|He called for a torch, 
ran in, and, trembling, fell before Paul and Silas. 
30|He brought them out and said, 
“Sirs, what must I do to be saved from my wretched spiritual and moral condition?” 

31|They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your household will be 
saved,” 
32|and he told him the Word of the Lord, him together with his entire 
household. 
33|At that moment in the middle of the night he took them into his 
personal care and dressed their wounds. With no further delay he was baptized, he and 
all who were under his authority[E], 
34|and he brought them upstairs[F] to his 
apartment and sat them down at his table and put out a spread of food. He rejoiced 
with his entire household, as they all arrived at the point where they had faith in God.
          
35|Now days went by and the magistrates sent the constables saying, “Let 
those men out now.” 
36|The jail keeper informed Paul, “The magistrates have sent 
word so that you can go free. So at this time, leave and go in peace (i.e., go your way free of 
conflict, duress, or affliction).” 
37|Paul said to the jail keeper, “They beat us in public 
without a decision handed down from a court proceeding—men who are Roman 
citizens—threw us in jail—and now they want to kick us out of jail in secret? No—not a 
chance—have them personally come over and bring us out themselves.” 
38|The 
constables told the magistrates these remarks; those who heard this became afraid that 
they’re indeed Roman citizens. 
39|They came and pleaded with them, brought them 
out, and kept on asking them to leave the city. 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]presiding board…Lit: elders
*[c]from speaking…Lit: to speak
*[d]over…Lit: down. They were coming down in elevation, coming out of the mountains.
*[e]trying…The word used here implies that each attempt to go into Bithynia was a trial
*[f]luxurious cloth…Lit: purple cloth
*[g]sympathizer and near-convert to Judaism…Lit: fearing God. Ref. note of Acts 10:2.
*[h]wouldn’t take “no” for an answer…Lit: urged; compelled
*[i]bosses…Or: overlords; or perhaps owners
*[j]what you need to do to set things right with God…Lit: the way of salvation
*[k]by the authority vested in me by Jesus Christ…Lit: in name of Jesus Christ

*[A]we…First occurrence of we instead of they, as Luke joins up with Paul at Troas.
*[B]the women who had formed a group there…Many believe that this group of women were the seed out 
of which the church at Philippi was formed, and as a result the Philippian church—the one Paul’s epistle 
was addressed to—consisted entirely of women. Upon examining Paul’s epistles, the Philippian church 
stands out as one of the more mature and spiritual congregations written about in the NT.
*[C]Exasperated…The Gk. word diaponeuomai (διαπονέομαι/Strong’s 1279) used twice in the NT, here 
and in 4:2, literally means being toiled throughout. Though exasperated is in line with 4:2, and also that 
the NIV renders it became so annoyed and the NASB greatly annoyed, this context seems to insinuate 
something different, closer to the KJV’s rendering of diaponeuomai as grieved. It’s as though Paul didn’t 
know that this woman was possessed by a demon spirit until the Holy Spirit revealed it to him instantly, 
at a discrete point in time. He became grieved that moment and immediately cast the spirit out of her. 
Paul wouldn’t have procrastinated for several days in dealing with a spirit.
*[D]flew off the handle…Lit: tore their cloaks. Some liberties taken. Ref. note of Matt. 26:65. Strange thing 
is that this is a Jewish practice and one would assume that the magistrates here are Gentiles. Perhaps 
the magistrates were Jews after all, and this would explain their animosity towards Paul and Silas. Also, 
in vv. 21,22 the bosses who dragged Paul and Silas before the magistrates harp on the fact that Paul and 
Silas are Jews encouraging Romans to adopt Jewish practices. This would mean that the bosses are 
painting Jews (Paul and Silas) as troublemakers in front of other Jews (the magistrates) for their own 
personal gain (playing the race card, as we say nowadays).
*[E]all who were under his authority …Lit: all them of his. Obviously, this refers to those in his household, 
but the literal, face-value meaning of these words insinuates anyone who’s “his,” or anyone who is 
under his authority, which would include any other jailers who worked under him too. Ref. note of 
11:14.
[F]brought them upstairs…Lit: he led them up. As this is rendered literally, the jailer must’ve lived in an 
apartment on a floor above the prison. This agrees with other details in the narrative. In v. 27, the jail 
keeper was awakened from his sleep by the earthquake, as he was sleeping on the upper floor of the 
same building which was shaken. Also, the problem of sending a message across town in the middle of 
the night to awaken his family and have them come to the prison (and many cities had curfews back 
then too) is solved. Verse 33 says that all of them were baptized immediately. So when the jail keeper 
took Paul and Silas and served them a meal, he took them upstairs to his apartment, never leaving the 
jail. Taking Paul and Silas out of the building in the middle of the night likely would’ve cost the jailer his 
job and probably his life too.

40|After leaving the jail, they went 
to Lidia’s house and were hosted there, and once they saw comrades, they comforted 
them, and they finally departed.


&ACTS 17
1|After travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonis, they came to 
Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue. 
2|For three Sabbaths Paul went to the 
synagogue and approached those who meet in the synagogue, as he was his habit of doing, 
and reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 
3|going through detail after detail, 
example after example[a] presenting to them that the Messiah, the Christ, had to suffer 
and be raised from the dead and that this person Jesus is the Messiah…”The one I’m 
making known to you.” 
4|Some of them were persuaded and joined in with Paul and 
Silas, including a great many of the devout, God-fearing westerners (i.e., Greek-
speaking near-Jewish converts), and no small number of the leading women.
          
5|Overtaken by the passions of jealousy, the Jews went so far as to recruit some 
hooligans from the hangouts in the middle of town, formed a mob out of them, and 
proceeded to cause a commotion. After attacking Jason’s house, they started to try to 
parade them over to the rabble. 
6|Not finding them there, they proceeded to drag 
Jason and some of the comrades[b] over to the city officials, all the while shouting, 
“Those guys who’ve ripped through the civilized world like a tornado[c] have arrived 
here, 
7|the ones Jason has taken in as guests. All these guys engage in activities that 
violate Caesar’s ordinances, claiming that there’s a different king named Jesus.” 

8|Hearing this disturbed the crowd and the city officials, 
9|and they collected the 
fine commensurate for the crime from Jason and from the rest of them and released them.
          
10|Wasting no time, the comrades immediately sent both Paul and Silas 
away to Berea during the night, who, after arriving and while being away, went to the 
synagogue. 
11|Now these people were more open-minded, better educated, and 
had more sophisticated thought processes than the Thessalonians, being individuals in 
particular who were totally gung-ho to embrace the Word, who day after day examined 
the Scriptures to see if all these things which Paul preached were in fact true. 
12|So 
then, many of them believed, including many of the prominent westerner-women and 
men—no small number in total. 
13|Now as the Jews from Thessalonica became 
aware that the Word of God was being proclaimed in Berea, they went there as well to 
shake up the crowds and to cause them to feel disturbed. 
14|Immediately then the 
comrades sent Paul away, having him walk until he reached the ocean, while Silas and 
Timothy remained there. 
15|Those who escorted Paul escorted him until they got 
to Athens and received an order from Paul destined for Silas and Timothy that they 
should leave and come to him as quickly as possible.
          
16|While Paul was waiting for them to arrive, his spirit was provoked and 
enraged seeing the city overrun with idols; 
17|so then he kept on reasoning with 
and disputing with the Jews and the devout sympathizers of Judaism[d] in the 
synagogue and day in, day out with whoever happened to be in the city square.
          
18|Now some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers[e][A] engaged him in a 
discussion; some proceeded to say, “What point is this dilettante-intellectual here trying 
to make[B]?”, but others said, “He seems to be a preacher who preaches about weird 
imps[f].” They were saying this because he was spreading the word about Jesus and his 
resurrection, 
19|and they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus 
council on Mars Hill, saying, “May we get up to speed on what the new-fangled 
teaching taught by you is all about? 
20|You see, what you’re filling our heads 
with[g] is strange, so we wish to understand how this fits into the big picture[h].” 

21|(Now all Athenians and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for 
anything other than talking about or hearing about something novel.)
          
22|Paul stood in center-stage before everyone at the Areopagus and said, 
“Men, Athenians[i], what I observe of you is that you’re exceptionally devout in every 
regard; 
23|you see, looking up at your objects of veneration while passing through, 
I ran across an elevated-altar on which is inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’ You offer up 
religious devotion to that which is unknown to you, so I’ll have you know this: 

24|The God who made the world and everything in it—this sky and earth that you 
see all around you[j]—is a lord who does not dwell in man-made temples, 
25|nor 
needs the hands-on attendance of healing treatments, as He Himself gives life and 
breath and everything to everyone and everything, 
26|and in addition made all the 
nations, races, and ethnic groups that you see living all over the planet[k] out of one 
person, after delineating arranged seasons and the extent to which they linger, 

27|and made all the nations to seek after God if perchance they might reach out to 
touch and handle Him and in so doing find Him. 
28|You see, in Him we live and 
are set in motion and have our existence[l], as some of your own poets have stated too,

“For we are God’s offspring[C] indeed


29|”So an offspring which gets its existence from God ought not consider the 
Divine Deity to be comparable to a figure of some sort made with gold, silver, or stone, a 
craftsman’s sculpture and the reflection of a person’s conceptualization. 
30|So then, 
having overlooked the epochs[m] of ignorance, at this time God is ordering all people 
everywhere to go about having a change of heart and of ways[n], 
31|because a day 
has been marked on the calendar in which He’s going to judge the civilized world from 
the perspective of Him being always right and of Him expecting people to do right[o]— 
judge the world by a man whom He designated, offering assurance to everyone that this 
is indeed the case by having resurrected him[p] from the dead.”
          
32|Once they heard “life-after-death” (i.e. the resurrection of the dead), 
some began to sneer, but others said, “We’d like to hear from you on this subject again, 
for sure.” 
33|And with that, Paul left center-stage. 
*[a]going through detail after detail, example after example…Lit: opening throughout
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]ripped through the civilized world like a tornado…Lit: ravaged the inhabited world. Ravaged is a 
hyperbole; some liberties taken.
*[d]devout sympathizers of Judaism…Lit: God-fearers. Ref. note of Acts 10:2.

expression likely.

*[j]this sky and earth that you see all around you…Lit: this existing sky and earth
*[k]all the nations, races, and ethnic groups that you see living all over the planet…Lit: all nations of men

righteousness
*[p]offering assurance to everyone that this is indeed the case by having resurrected him…Or: offering faith 
to everyone after resurrecting him

*[A]Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers…Or: certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. In the GT 
for, Luke is explicit in saying that the philosophers here were only Epicurean and Stoic, and no other 
kinds. As the two schools of philosophy, stoicism and epicureanism, have debated each other since their 
inception, Luke is insinuating that they’re wanting to see how Paul and his teaching fit into the 
framework of the stoicism vs. epicureanism debate.
*[B]What point is this dilettante-intellectual here trying to make?…Lit: What would this logic-dabbler keep 
saying? What Luke wrote here, and what was originally spoken, here and in the surrounding verses 
shows a marked upturn in the sophistication of the Gk. used—unlike what is found in the Gospels or 
other places. It demonstrates the intelligence, education, and sophistication of those speaking (as 
recorded by Luke), speaking in their native language. This is more on the level of something from the 
classical era.
[C]God’s offspring…Lit: offspring of [Him]. This is a quotation from the Gk. poet Aratus, Paul knows those 
listening are familiar with the entire poem and therefore its context. We, however, receive a fragment 
of the poem, and the fragment taken in isolation is ambiguous. But what Paul says next in v. 29 clarifies 
the ambiguity and states explicitly what he meant by of Him in Aratus’s quotation in v. 28. In v. 29, Paul 
says has its existence from God, the words from God refer to of [Him].

34|Now some of the men 
joined up with him and became believers, among whom were Dionysius, a member of 
the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. 


&ACTS 18
1|After this Paul got himself away from Athens and went to Corinth. 
2|He 
found a certain Jew by the name of Aquila, who grew up in Pontus but had recently 
come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, who had both come because of Claudius’s order to 
expel all the Jews from Rome, and went to them. 
3|Being of the same trade, he 
proceeded to take up residence near them and to start working. In this regard they were 
tent makers by trade. 
4|He kept on reasoning and trying to win over those in the 
synagogue every Sabbath, Sabbath after Sabbath, and was persuading Jews and 
westerners time and again.
          
5|As they (Silas and Timothy) came over from Macedonia, Paul continued to 
devote himself to the preaching of the Word, solemnly declaring to the Jews that Jesus is 
the Messiah. 
6|As they were deployed against him hurling abuses, he shook out his 
clothing signaling his having nothing to do with them and said, “You’re to blame for your 
own destruction[a]! I’m wiping my hands of it[b]! From now on, I’m going to the 
Gentiles.” 
7|He left there and was taken into the home of[c] someone named Titius 
Justus, a pious God-worshipper, whose house was next-door to the synagogue.
          
8|Now the synagogue head Crispus came to have faith in the Lord together 
with his entire household, and hearing this, many of the Corinthians started to have 
faith in the Lord and were being baptized. 
9|The Lord spoke to Paul at night in a 
dream, “Don’t fall into fear[d]—no—keep on talking and don’t fall silent, 

10|because I am with you and no one can lay a hand on you to harm you, because 
a dedicated group of people[e] are with me—a great many of them—in this city.” 

11|So for a year and a half he filled the role of teacher[f] among them, teaching them 
the Word of God.
          
12|While Gallio was the Roman proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, united in 
heart, mind, and purpose, jumped Paul and brought him to the courtroom where Gallio 
sat as judge[g], 
13|saying “This guy uses the Law of Moses to convince people to not 
be piously devoted to God and to not worship Him.” 
14|Just as Paul was about to 
open his mouth to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “Oh you Jews! If this really was some 
wrong-doing or nefarious crime, I would’ve put up with this from you while complying 
with the methodology of a court proceeding. 
15|But issues concerning concepts, 
authority, reputations, law, etc. that are specific to you are to be monitored by you; I do 
not wish to be a judge who decides these matters,” 
16|and dismissed their case. 

17|Everyone[h] got ahold of the synagogue head Sosthenes and began to beat him 
right there in the courtroom[g], and Gallio had no intention of doing anything about it.
          
18|Paul continued to stay with the comrades[i] for a good number of days 
more, said goodbye to them, and proceeded to sail to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla 
and Aquila[A], after shaving his head in Cenchreae, since, you see, he was holding fast to 
the restrictions that come with an Old Testament pledge called a Nazirite vow. 
19|They 
arrived in Ephesus, and he left those others there, but he for his part went to the 
synagogue and proceeded to reason with the Jews. 
20|When they asked him to 
stay for an even longer time, he wouldn’t acquiesce, 
21|but said goodbye instead, 
“If it’s God’s will, I’ll come back and visit you again” and put out to sea from Ephesus. 

22|After he went down to Caesarea and went over and greeted the church, he went 
down to Antioch. 
23|After spending some time there, he left and went through one 
part of Galatia after another and Phrygia too, putting the disciples on a firm footing.
          
24|Now a certain Jew who grew up in Alexandrian named Apollos, a man 
who was quite the scholar, arrived in Ephesus[B], being proficient and capable in the 
Scriptures. 
25|This fellow was schooled[j] in the Way of the Lord, and as he was 
fervent—boiling-over really—in the Spirit, he went about speaking and kept 
meticulously teaching on the subject of Jesus, understanding John’s baptism only. 

26|In addition this fellow began to speak boldly and freely in the synagogue. Once 
Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and correctly explained to him the 
Way of the Lord. 
27|As he was wanting to tour in Achaia, prompted to do so the 
comrades wrote a letter of recommendation to the disciples there to receive him, who 
when he arrived was joined in tight unison[k] with those who had become believers 
through the grace of God. 
*[a]You’re to blame for your own destruction…Lit: Your blood [be] upon your head. A biblical idiom.
*[b]I’m wiping my hands of it…Lit: I clean
*[c]was taken into the home of…Lit: entered into the house of. Entered into in the context of entering 
someone’s house is a NT expression that means that the homeowner extended an invitation to stay for 
several days.
*[d]Don’t fall into fear…fall silent…Lit: don’t be afraid…don’t be silent. The Gk. grammar suggests that Paul 
was not already afraid nor was he silent; the encouragement was to stay away from fear and avoid 
silence, rather than to pull oneself out of one or the other or both.
*[e]a dedicated group of people…A [folk] people. The word for people here is the same used throughout 
the NT to describe the people of Israel. It means ordinary people who share a common bond, to the 
point of comprising a nation. The interpolation dedicated is insinuated by the context.
*[f]filled the role of teacher…Lit: sat. The word sat is similar in meaning to when we when we refer to a 
professorship as a chair.
*[g]courtroom where Gallio sat as judge…right there in the courtroom…Lit: judgment seat…before the 
judgment seat. Some liberties taken.
*[h]Everyone…This is a figure of speech, a type of synecdoche, which does not literally mean everyone. 
Ref. note of Matt. 3:5.
*[i]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[j]schooled…Lit: taught by word-of-mouth. Probably referring to something learned in a lecture-style 
classroom environment, rather than self-studying books.
*[k]joined in tight unison…The lectionary says this word was used for the confluence of streams or for 
soldiers locking their shields together during battle

*[A]Priscilla and Aquila…Noteworthy is that Priscilla is named before Aquila, though in v. 2 Aquila is named 
first. This is a hint that Priscilla was of greater assistance to Paul than Aquila.
[B]Arrived in Ephesus…Rev. 2 gives hints that the Ephesian church was stamped with Apollos’s 
characteristics, namely his scholasticism. For more info, ref. book A Path through Revelation.

28|The fact is, he kept on overwhelming the Jews in 
public with refutations, vehemently showing with specifics through the Scriptures that 
Jesus is the Messiah.


&ACTS 19
1|Now what happened when Apollos was in Corinth was that Paul passed 
through the highland districts and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples off to the 
side there 
2|and said,
      “Did you get the baptism in the Holy Spirit now that you’ve become believers?”
      They replied, “Not only did we not receive it, but we’ve not heard of there being a 
baptism in the Holy Spirit.[A]”
          
3|And to that Paul said, “What have you been baptized into (i.e., into what 
covenant have you been initiated)?”
      They said, “Into John the Baptist’s baptism.”
          
4|Paul said, “John’s baptism was an initiation into a covenant of a change of 
heart and of ways[a], while at the same time he was baptizing he was telling the people to 
look to the Coming-One who comes later so that they would believe in him. This person 
is Jesus.”
          
5|After hearing this, they were baptized by the authority of the Lord Jesus[B]. 

6|When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them[C] as they were 
baptized in the Holy Spirit, and along with that they began speaking in tongues and 
speaking Holy-Spirit-inspired words[b]. 
7|All told, there were about twelve men (not 
including women and children) there.
          
8|After he introduced himself to the synagogue and became affiliated with the 
people there[D], for three months he proceeded to openly and freely reason with and 
attempt to convince the members about things pertaining to God’s involvement with 
mankind[c]. 
9|As some kept on getting more and more resistant[d] and turned-off, bad-
mouthing the Way in front of the majority, he parted ways with them and pulled the 
disciples away, while day by day reasoning in the lecture forum in Tyrannus. 

10|Now this occurred for two years, to the extent that everyone living in the Roman 
province of Asia heard the Word of the Lord, both Jews and westerners, 
11|and God 
kept performing miracles through the hands of Paul, 
12|even to the extent that 
cloths, handkerchiefs, and tradesman’s aprons which he had bare-skin, physical contact 
with which were taken from him, and when laid over those who were run-down[e] from 
an illness or whatnot, the diseases left them, and the Evil Spirits went out of them[E].
          
13|There were these roaming Jewish exorcists[f] who attempted to invoke the 
delegated authority of[g] the Lord Jesus Christ over people who have Evil Spirits by 
saying, “I exorcise[f] you all by the authority of Jesus whom Paul preaches!” 
14|Now 
there were seven sons of a certain Jewish chief priest named Sceva doing this to an Evil 
Spirit one day, 
15|and the Evil Spirit replied to them, “I’m familiar with Jesus and I 
know about Paul, but who are you?”, 
16|and the man who had the Evil Spirit in 
him assaulted them and dominated and overpowered them to the extent that they fled 
the building half-naked[h], bruised, and beaten.
          
17|This became known to all the Jews who were living in Ephesus and to 
the westerners as well, and fear fell upon all of them, and what the Lord Jesus is all 
about[i] began to be magnified, 
18|and many of those who had become believers 
began confessing out loud what their sinful habits are, telling everyone about them. 

19|A sizeable number of those involved in the occult gathered their books together 
and burned them up in front of everyone. When they added up the cost of the books, 
they arrived at a figure of $6.25 million[F]. 
20|In this way—according to the Lord’s 
awesome power—the Word kept on growing and getting stronger.
          
21|As these things ran their course, Paul determined by the Spirit[j] to go 
through Macedonia and the Roman province of Asia in the course of going to 
Jerusalem, having said, “After I’ve been there, I’ve got to see Rome too.” 
22|He 
sent two of his helping-assistants[G], Timothy and Erastus, on ahead, while he, on the 
other hand, stayed back for a period of time in Asia.
          
23|Meanwhile, no trivial disturbance took place with regard to the Way. 

24|You see, a certain fellow by the name of Demetrius, a silversmith by trade who 
made silver shrines of the Greek goddess Artemis which generated a not-so-insubstantial 
income for the guild, 
25|gathered everyone connected with this line of work 
together and said, “Gentlemen, you know that our well-being comes from this trade, 

26|and you see for yourself that this Paul-guy is talking a good number of people 
in Ephesus—and in nearly all of Asia—into disregarding and shunning our handiwork, 
claiming that man-made objects are not gods. 
27|Not only does this threaten that 
our profession will become disreputable, but it also threatens that the temple of the great 
goddess Artemis will lose all of its prestige and all this will wind up destroying her 
magnificence, she whom the entire province of Asia and the civilized world worships.”
          
28|Once they heard this, they were filled with rage and shouted, “The 
Ephesians’ Artemis is awesome![H]” 
29|The city was filled with turmoil, and, once 
they caught Paul’s Macedonian travelling companions Gaius and Aristarchus, they all 
together rushed to the theater. 
30|Paul was wanting to engage[k] the mob, but the 
disciples wouldn’t let him. 
31|Some of the public officials, being his friends, sent 
word to him begging him not to venture into the theater. 
32|Some kept shouting 
one thing, some another thing. The fact is, the throng was confused; most of them didn’t 
know why they’d gathered together. 
          
33|The crowd pinned the blame on Alexander, who was pushed to the front 
by the Jews. Alexander motioned to the mob with his hand so that he could begin 
talking his way out of the situation. 
34|Recognizing that he’s a Jew, for about two 
hours they shouted a singular chant, “The Ephesians’ Artemis is awesome!” 

35|After hushing the crowd, the city clerk said, “Gentlemen, fellow Ephesians[l], 
show me one person who doesn’t know that the Ephesians’ city is home to and 
protector and custodian of Artemis the Awesome, the image which fell down from 
Zeus. 
36|Since this is absolutely the case, we’ve got to settle down and not do 
anything rash. 
37|You see, you brought these men who are neither temple-robbers 
nor blasphemers of our goddess here against their wills. 
38|Now if Demetrius along 
with his fellow tradesmen really have a complaint to levy against anyone, there’s such a 
person called a ‘proconsul’—let them take it before him. 
39|But if that’s not good 
enough for you, whatever it is you’re wanting to have done will have to be resolved 
through the court system. 
40|The fact is, based on what’s taken place today, we’re 
in jeopardy of being accused of rioting, since we have no good excuse for what we’ve 
done.”
          
*[a]John’s baptism was an initiation into a covenant of a change of heart and of ways…Lit: John baptized a 
baptism of repentance
*[b]speaking Holy-Spirit-inspired words…Lit: prophesying
*[c]God’s interaction with mankind…Lit: the kingdom of God
*[d]resistant…Lit: hardened [of heart]
*[e]run-down…Lit: weak. Ref. note of Matt. 4:23.
*[f]Jewish exorcists…I exorcise…Same base-word used for exorcists and exorcise
*[g]to invoke the delegate authority of…Lit: to name the name of
*[h]half-naked…Lit: naked. Assuming that “naked” means “half-naked” and not “completely naked,” same 
as in Matt. 25:36.
*[i]what the Lord Jesus is all about…Lit: the name of the Lord Jesus
*[j]Paul determined by the Spirit…Lit: Paul put himself by the Spirit. The word put when used concerning 
one’s heart is an expression. This expression appears in 5:2 also.
*[k]engage the mob…Lit: enter into the mob. Same expression used in v. 8; see note there.
*[l]Gentlemen, fellow Ephesians…Ref. note of Acts 1:9

*[A]Not only did we not receive it, but we’ve not heard of there being a baptism in the Holy Spirit…This 
sentence doesn’t lend itself to word-for-word translation; the GT reads like conversational Gk., needing 
interpolations, rather than written Gk. In other words, what we see in the first half of this verse is a the 
sort of language everyday people spoke in back then—not formal Gk.
*[B]they were baptized by the authority of the Lord Jesus…Lit: they were baptized in [by] the name of the 
Lord Jesus. This is when they received Christ as Lord. An open question is whether they were baptized in 
water a second time after this, as all Christians are baptized when they believe, or whether John’s 
baptism sufficed. But in any case, after being “baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus” (after believing in 
Jesus), they were baptized in the Holy Spirit, thus demonstrating once again that, generally speaking, the 
baptism in the Holy Spirit happens after one accepts Christ as Savior—not at the same time.
*[C]the Holy Spirit came upon them…The Holy Spirit coming upon a person is an expression. It does not 
refer to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that a person receives as part of believing in the Lord; rather, it 
means that a person receives the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is almost always an event distinct 
from receiving the Lord and one which occurs afterwards.
*[D]he introduced himself to the synagogue and became affiliated with the people there…Lit: he entered 
into the synagogue. This idiom is used in elsewhere in the NT, specifically in Mark 3:1; Luke 4:16; Luke 
6:6, 13:14; 14:1; 17:1,2,10; 18:19; 19:30; 28:8; James 2:2. It has a few different meanings (or multiple 
meanings at the same time). What should be kept in mind is that a synagogue is first and foremost an 
assembly of people, in the same way that a church is an assembly of people, and secondly a building or 
some other premise. Therefore, this expression means: He introduced himself to those in the synagogue 
and attended one of their meetings; He became a member of the synagogue; He became affiliated with 
the synagogue; He visited the synagogue. It may be that this expression denotes a formal custom of 
introduction where a new member is greeted by those in the synagogue. As part of this, the new 
member’s credentials are submitted, and if he’s learned enough in the Scriptures, he’ll be given the 
opportunity to stand before the synagogue and teach—or at least to talk in smaller, more informal 
groups. This idiom is also used in phrases like “enter into the kingdom of heaven,” “enter into eternal 
life,” etc., as in Matt. 7:21; 19:17,23; 25:21, 26:41; Luke 11:52; 22:40,46.
*[E]and the diseases left them, and the Evil Spirits went out of them…Yet another example of disease and 
evil spirits lumped into the same category. If God causes disease, does He cause evil spirits to afflict 
people as well?
*[F]$6.25 million…Lit: 50,000 silver [coins]. Assume that the coin is a drachma. Ref. conversion notes in 
Matt. 18:28 and elsewhere.
*[G]two of his helping-assistants…Lit: two of those serving him. The word for those serving here is 
translated deacon elsewhere. These were Paul’s servants, doing his bidding. Timothy started out at a 
young age helping Paul, and as he proved trustworthy, Paul assigned him more and more challenging 
tasks, as Timothy continued to prove his faithfulness and dedication, to the point where a couple of 
letters Paul sent him are enshrined in the NT. All of this is included in the post of NT deacon.
[H]The Ephesians’ Artemis is awesome!…Since the same exact wording appears in v.34 and since these 
words are blurted repeatedly, this was likely a popular, well-known, often-repeated chant. Whenever 
the crowd got whipped into a frenzy, they would repeat this chant. This is like something that goes on 
nowadays at a sporting event, protest, or political rally.

41|After he said this, he dismissed the throng.


&ACTS 20
1|After the riot stopped Paul sent for the disciples, and once he encouraged 
them and after a going-away get-together, he left for Macedonia. 
2|After passing 
through those parts and encouraging them with many a message, he went to Greece, 

3|and after he’d put in three months there, a plot by the Jews against him 
materialized while he was about to set sail for Syria; he wound up making the decision 
to return via Macedonia.
          
4|Now accompanying him were Pyrrhus’s son Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus 
and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and 
Trophimus from the Roman province of Asia. 
5|These fellows went out ahead and 
waited for us in Troas. 
6|We set sail from Philippi after the multi-day Feast of 
Unleavened Bread ended, and by the time five days or so went by met up with those in 
Troas, where we stayed on for seven days.
          
7|On a Sunday[a] when we gathered to break bread (i.e., have a communion meal 
while enjoying each other’s company), Paul kept on explaining to them in depth the logic 
behind what he taught, pointing out to them the logical fallacies of the opposing points of 
view, and in general covering a given subject with them from top to bottom[A]. Because 
he was planning on leaving the next day, he was lengthening the lesson until midnight.
          
8|Now in the upstairs room in which they were gathered, there were enough 
lamps to provide a sufficient amount of lighting, 
9|and there was a teenager there 
named Eutychus sitting on the window sill who fell deep asleep while Paul was going 
into more and more explanations, and who, when he was woken up, fell out of the third 
floor and was pronounced dead on the spot[b]. 
10|Paul went down, vigorously 
attended to him[c], took him in his arms, and said, “Don’t make a commotion—he’s 
alive[d], you see.” 
11|He went back up, prayed over the meal[e], ate to his heart’s 
content[f], and spoke until dawn: That’s the manner in which he departed. 
12|They 
took the lad away—and he was alive when they did—and were relieved in no small 
way.
          
13|We went on ahead and got on the ship and sailed to Assos, intending to 
take on Paul there as a passenger; you see, he had arranged for things to be done that 
way, while he himself planned to travel by foot. 
14|When he met us in Assos, he 
boarded, and we went to Mitylene, 
15|and from there caught an outbound wind 
the following day and arrived at a place across from Chios. The following day we cut 
across to Samos, and the day after that arrived in Miletus. 
16|You see, Paul had 
weighed the options and decided to sail past Ephesus, in order to not waste time in 
Asia; the fact is, he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem in time for the Pentecost holiday, 
if possible.
          
17|From Miletus Paul sent a message to Ephesus and summoned the church 
governing board[B] together to meet with him when he got there. 
18|When they met up 
with him, he told them, “Starting with the first day I set foot in Asia, you know how 
I’ve spent the entire time with you, 
19|serving the Lord in total humility and self-
abasement and in tears and during the hard times of the plots fomented against me by 
the Jews, 
20|as I did not shirk a bit in telling you the things which are a benefit to 
you, teaching you in public and indoors privately, 
21|solemnly declaring to both 
the Jews and the Gentiles a change of heart and of ways[g] in relation to God and 
declaring faith in our Lord Jesus. 
22|Take note of this: I’ve been compelled[h] by the 
Spirit to go to Jerusalem; what I’ll be confronted with there, I do not know. 

23|Nevertheless, in city after city the Holy Spirit solemnly goes on record to tell me 
that bonds and afflictions await me. 
24|But—no—I have not uttered a peep about 
how precious my life is to me as I finish my race and complete the ministry which I 
received from the Lord Jesus, to thoroughly declare the good-news-message[i] of the 
grace of God.
          
25|”Take note of this: I know that all of you—you whom I was preaching 
the Kingdom of God to while passing through the area—will never set eyes on me again[j]. 

26|Therefore I’m going on record this very day to say that I can’t be blamed for the 
destruction of the lives of anyone[k], 
27|for I have not shirked in telling anyone the 
will of our God. 
28|Be mindful of yourselves and of the entire flock of Christians[l] 
whom the Holy Spirit put you as overseers[C] (or bishops) over, leading[C] God’s church, a 
church which he acquired through his very-own blood. 
29|I know that 
monstrous[m] wolves will join up with you[n] after my departure, penetrating your inner-
circle, not sparing the flock, 
30|and men will arise from among you who speak 
distorted, perverted, and corrupted things, causing some of the disciples to commit 
apostasy by becoming their followers[D]. 
31|Therefore be continuously and 
vigilantly on the lookout, remembering that day and night for three years I did not take 
a break from warning every last one of you—warning you in tears.
          
32|”At this time I commit you to God and to the concept of His grace, to be 
edified by the Power (the miracle-working power in fact) and for God’s end-goal plan for 
your lives[o] to be granted among those who’ve been set apart and have been made 
holy[p]. 
33|Any kind of cash, checks, or clothing[q] I desired from no one. 

34|You’re personally acquainted with the fact that my own hands attended to my 
needs and subsistence. 
35|I’ve pointed all this out to you so that you participate in 
like manner in the toil of helping those who are weak (perhaps weak because of a sickness of 
some sort) and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, ‘It is more 
blessed to go about giving than to go about receiving.’”
          
36|After he said these things, he dropped to his knees to pray with all of 
them. 
37|A good amount of crying by everyone took place, and they wrapped their 
arms forcefully around Paul’s neck[r] and kept on kissing him, 
*[a]Sunday…Lit: first of the Sabbaths. Ref. note of Mark 16:2.
*[b]pronounced dead on the spot…Lit: taken away dead. When they got to his body, they immediately 
pronounced him dead and instead of trying to treat him proceeded to take away his dead body.
*[c]vigorously attended to him…Lit: fell to him. The word fell is similar to usage in the common NT 
expression fall upon, which means to assault. Fell to him here has the same meaning as when 
paramedics attend to a person in an emergency. They are acting quickly, decisively, and aggressively, 
appropriate for the life-threatening situation.
*[d]he’s alive…Lit: his soul is in him
*[e]prayed over the meal…Lit: broke the bread
*[f]ate to his heart’s content…Lit: tasted upon a good amount. An expression.
*[g]change of heart and of ways…Lit: repentance
*[h]compelled…Lit: bound
*[i]the good-news-message…Lit: the Gospel
*[j]never set eyes on me again…Lit: no longer see my face. An expression.
*[k]I can’t be blamed for the destruction of the lives of anyone…Lit: I am clean from the blood of all. A 
biblical idiom. Ref. note of Acts 18:6
*[l]flock of Christians…Lit: flock of sheep. The metaphor of shepherd as leaders and sheep as followers is 
extensive throughout the Bible, particularly in the NT.
*[m]monstrous…Lit: heavy; metaphorically means ruthless, grievous, troublesome; when speaking of 
soldiers, it means heavily-armed.
*[n]will join up with you…Lit: will go into you. Similar wording as 19:8; ref. note there.
*[o]God’s end-goal plan for your lives…Lit: the inheritance
*[p]those who’ve been set apart and have been made holy…Or: the ones who have been sanctified
*[q]Any kind of cash, checks, or clothing…Lit: Of gold and of silver and of clothing. The words gold and 
silver refer to gold and silver coins. Some liberties taken.
*[r]wrapped their arms forcefully around Paul’s neck…Lit: they fell upon Paul’s neck. Same expression used 
in Luke 15:20. Falling upon in other contexts means assaulting; in this context it is used metaphorically 
to insinuate a physical—to the point of being forceful even—kind of embrace.

*[A]kept on explaining to them in depth the logic behind what he taught, pointing out to them the logical 
fallacies of the opposing points of view, and in general covering a given subject with them from top to 
bottom…Or: reasoned to them. The Gk. word for reasoned here is the same word used in 17:2,17; 
18:4,19; 19:8,9; 20:9, and in those verses means the same thing. Paul’s epistle to the Galatians show him 
“reasoning” in this way, and this is what Luke says he was doing here in 20:7. Nowadays, this would fall 
under the category of “teaching,” but the Gk. words for reasoning and teaching don’t correspond exactly 
to the English words reasoning and teaching. The Gk. word for teaching implies dictating moral 
instruction (ref. 15:1), whereas the word for reasoning is explaining the logic behind something, the 
topic at times being difficult to understand.
*[B]church governing board…Lit: the elders of the church. The church at Ephesus, a Gentile church, was run 
by elders. Later in Acts, we see churches run by bishops. Both forms of church government were in use 
in the NT; therefore, both forms are sanctioned.
*[C]overseers…leading…Lit: bishops…shepherding [or pastoring]. This is the first occurrence of the word 
bishop [overseer] in the NT. In modern times, we often use the word pastor when we technically-
speaking mean bishop. Note that these bishops are the elders referred to in v. 17. Also, the word 
rendered leader here is actually shepherd or pastor. Throughout the Bible, the word shepherd means 
leader. In the NT, the word means pastor, and it is where we get the word in its modern usage.
[D]causing some of the disciples to commit apostasy by becoming their followers…Lit: drawing away the 
disciples after them. The word drawing away is the same base-word that is rendered apostasy in 2 
Thess. 2:3. The words after them are used throughout the NT to mean one person following another, or 
submitting to the will of another (same usage in Matt. 4:19; ref. note there).

Acts
*[D]causing some of the disciples to commit apostasy by becoming their followers…Lit: drawing away the 
disciples after them. The word drawing away is the same base-word that is rendered apostasy in 2 
Thess. 2:3. The words after them are used throughout the NT to mean one person following another, or 
submitting to the will of another (same usage in Matt. 4:19; ref. note there).

Acts
38|in agony most of 
all because of the message which he spoke that they would never set eyes on him again. 
They then proceeded to put him on the ship and send him off.


&ACTS 21
1|When it came time to set sail, once we were torn away from them, we set a 
straight course and came to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 

2|Finding a ship that was making the run straight to Phoenicia, not hugging the coast, 
we boarded and sailed off. 
3|When Cyprus appeared over the horizon, we kept it on 
our port side and kept on sailing to Syria and docked at Tyre, seeing that the ship was 
destined to unload its cargo there. 
4|Seeking out and finding disciples, we stayed 
there for seven days. Those disciples in particular kept on telling Paul through the Spirit 
to not go down to Jerusalem.
          
5|When those days were up, we left there and started walking, with everyone 
having a send-out for us, joined by their wives and children, until they got outside the 
city walls. At the shore we dropped to our knees and prayed. 
6|We tore ourselves 
away from each other and boarded the ship, and those good people returned to their 
kinfolk and fellow citizens[a].
          
7|For our part, we finished taking the ship from Tyre and arrived in Ptolemais, 
greeted the comrades[b] and spent a day with them. 
8|The next day we left and went 
to Caesarea, and were invited to stay at[c] Philip the Evangelist’s house (Philip being one 
of the original seven directors chosen in the early days), and stayed with him as his guests. 

9|This fellow had four unmarried[d] daughters who prophesied on a regular basis[A]. 

10|While staying put there for plenty of days, a certain-someone from the Judean 
church—a prophet named Agabus—came over from Jerusalem[e], 
11|approached 
them, took Paul’s belt off, tied his own hands and feet with it, and said, “Thus says the 
Holy Spirits: The Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt the same 
way as this and hand him over to the Gentiles to be put in custody by them.”
          
12|When we heard this, we and the locals as well advised him—begged 
him—not to go to Jerusalem. 
13|Paul then replied, “What are you all doing crying 
and breaking my heart? Fact is, I’m ready to not only be bound but also to be killed in 
Jerusalem, on behalf of all that the Lord Jesus stands for[f].” 
14|Not making any 
progress in talking him out of it, they quieted down and said, “May the Lord’s will 
come to pass.”
          
15|After this stretch of time was over, we made preparations and proceeded 
to go to Jerusalem. 
16|Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us as well, 
bringing us to a certain Cyprian named Mnason, whom we were to stay with, a disciple 
who had been around for a long time.
          
17|When we showed up in Jerusalem, the comrades gladly received us. 

18|The next day Paul—we—met up with James and the entire church governing 
board[g]. 
19|Once greetings were exchanged, he explained down to the last detail 
what God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry. 
20|Those 
who heard this glorified God and told him, “You see, comrade, how many tens of 
thousands there are within the Jewish community who have become believers, and all 
of them are zealous to be in compliance with the Law of Moses. 
21|The word’s going 
around about you that you’re instructing all the Jews to abandon the Law of Moses and 
live like Gentiles, telling them not to circumcise their boys and in refusing to do so, not 
enrolling them into Judaism nor to live a lifestyle of keeping[h] the ancient traditions that go 
hand-in-hand with following the Law of Moses[B]. 
22|So what’s the story here[i]? 
Everyone’s going to hear that you’ve come to town and will be sifting through every 
statement you make which they hear through the grapevine.
          
23|”So this is what you should do[j]: There are four men who have voluntarily 
taken the Old Testament pledge called the Nazirite vow and are partway through it[k]. 

24|Befriend them, perform Jewish purification rituals with them as a group and 
pay their expenses until they reach the end of their vow when they’ll shave their heads, and 
everyone will know that the word-on-the-street about you is baloney[l], and you live 
uprightly instead and keep the Law of Moses for your own self. 
25|Now about the 
Gentiles who’ve become believers: we disseminated the decision to obey the following 
list of rules: to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from slaughtering an animal with the 
intent of drinking its blood, and from bizarre sexual immorality.”
          
26|Paul then befriended the four men, and on the following day, once he 
was ritualistically purified, entered the temple complex with them, letting everyone 
know the days of ritualistic purification had been checked off, until such a time that the 
prescribed offering was offered by each one of them.
          
27|As the seven days were about to come to an end, the Jews from the Roman 
province of Asia saw him in the temple and proceeded to stir up everyone in the crowd, 
and they grabbed ahold of him, 
28|while shouting, “Men, fellow Israelites, help: 
this is the man who’s teaching everyone everywhere a teaching which is in opposition to 
what the folk-people believe and is against the Law of Moses and this very place. What’s 
more, he brought Gentiles into the temple and defiled this holy place.” 
29|You see, 
they had seen the Ephesian named Trophimus in the city with him beforehand, and they 
assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple at some point.
          
30|The entire city was perturbed, and the folk people formed a stampede, 
and forcibly taking hold of Paul, they proceeded to drag him outside the temple 
complex, and the temple gates were immediately shut behind them. 
31|And while 
trying to kill him, a report was dispatched to[m] the colonel of the Roman garrison[n] 
posted in the city that the entire city of Jerusalem was on the move. 
32|He 
immediately gathered soldiers and junior officers[o] to his side, chased them down, and 
cornered them. Seeing the colonel and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 

33|Next, the colonel drew near, took custody of him, spoke out an order that he be 
tied up with two chains, and inquired who he might be and what it is that he had done. 

34|Some of the people in the crowd were shouting one thing at them, some were 
shouting another. Unable to understand what was going on because of the riot, he 
ordered that he be brought to the garrison’s base. 
35|But when they got to the 
stairs, they found that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of them being 
pressured by the crowd. 
36|You see, a multitude of the folk-people were shouting, 
“Get rid of him!”
          
37|And while they were about to enter the base, Paul said to the colonel, 
“May I say something to you?” He said, “You know Greek? 
38|So that means that 
you’re not the Egyptian who a few months ago stirred up a rebellion and lead the 4,000 
men from the terrorist organization out into the desert.” 
39|Paul said, “I certainly 
am a Jew, from Tarsus, Cilicia, a citizen of a not-so-insignificant city. I’m asking you to 
return me to the folk-people and speak to them.” 
*[a]to their kinfolk and fellow citizens…Lit: to their own. Assuming their own refers to people; it could refer 
to affairs, things, etc.—or all of these.
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]were invited to stay at…Lit: entered into. An idiom.
*[d]unmarried…Lit: virgin
*[e]came over from Jerusalem…Lit: came down. The phrase came down implies that he came from 
Jerusalem, as the GT of the NT is consistent in saying that a person “goes up” to Jerusalem or “comes 
down” from Jerusalem.
*[f]all that the Lord Jesus stands for…Lit: the name of the Lord Jesus
*[g]church governing board…Lit: elders
*[h]live a lifestyle of keeping …Lit: walk
*[i]what’s the story here?…Lit: what is?
*[j]this is what you should do…Lit: do this that we tell you
*[k]who have taken the Old Testament pledge called the Nazirite vow and they’re partway through it…Lit: 
having a vow. Same wording as 18:18.
*[l]is baloney…Lit: is nothing
*[m]was dispatched to…Lit: a report went up. Here and in the next few verses, the words up and down are 
used in reference to the colonel and the soldiers, as though they were stationed in a tower or something 
of the sort.
*[n]Roman garrison…Lit: cohort. Around 500 soldiers.
*[o]junior officers…Lit: centurions

*[A]prophesied on a regular basis…Lit: prophesying. The Gk. text does explicitly say that they were 
prophetesses but that they prophesied. Since prophecy by its most basic definition is speaking Holy 
Spirit-inspired utterance, and not necessarily foretelling the future (word of wisdom) or having 
supernatural revelation of something going on that you would not otherwise know (word of knowledge), 
it is likely that they didn’t speak words of wisdom or words of knowledge, and were therefore not 
technically prophetesses.
*[B]nor to live a lifestyle of keeping the ancient, man-made traditions that go hand-in-hand with following 
the Law of Moses…Lit: nor walk in the traditions. The traditions were man-interpreted rules derived 
from the Law of Moses, with the intention of complying with the letter of the Law.

40|Paul turned around, went 
back, stood on the stairs, and motioned with his hand for the crowd to be silent. Once 
the crowd was quiet, he addressed them in Aramaic…[C]


&ACTS 22
1|[A]…”Men, fellow comrades, and patriarchs: listen to my side of the story 
now[a].” 
2|Once they heard him addressing them in Aramaic, they gave him their 
attention all the more. He then goes on to say, 
3|“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, Cilicia, 
raised in this city as an understudy of Gamaliel, having received tutelage down to the 
minutest detail from the foremost expert in the Law of Moses[c], being zealous of God in 
the same way that you all are today. 
4|I kept on persecuting those in the movement 
called This Way[d] to the point of death, subduing them and putting them in jail[e], both 
men and women[f] alike. 
5|As the high priest vouched for me (and every one of the 
councilmen[g] too), and along with that I also received letters of authorization addressed 
to the comrades in Damascus, I proceeded to go bring those who lived up there too to 
Jerusalem, all tied up, so that they would be forced into submission, thoroughly 
crushing their will to resist.
          
6|”What happened to me sometime around midday while walking and 
approaching Damascus is that a light from out of the sky suddenly shined around me, a 
light like a spotlight consisting of a continuous lightning flash. 
7|I fell to the ground 
and heard a voice saying to me,
      “‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
          
8|”I replied, ‘Who are you, sir?’
      “He told me, ‘I’m Jesus of Nazareth, whom you’re persecuting.’
          
9|”Now those who were accompanying me saw the light indeed, but didn’t 
hear the voice which was speaking to me.
          
10|”I said, ‘What do you want me to do[h], sir?’
      “The Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go to Damascus; everything that I’ve arranged 
for you to do will be explained to you there.’
          
11|”As I had lost my sight due to the glory of that magnificent light, I was led 
about by the hand the way blind men are by my colleagues and arrived in Damascus.
          
12|”Now someone named Ananias, a devout man according to what the 
Law of Moses prescribes, his devoutness affirmed by all the Jews living there, 

13|went up to me, stood over me, and said, ‘Comrade Saul, regain your sight,’ and 
that very moment I looked up at him and was able to see again. 
14|He said, ‘God 
of our ancestors appointed you to know His will and to see the One Who’s Right and to 
hear the sound of words coming from His mouth, 
15|because you will give an 
official account[i] to all sorts of people all over the place[j] about what you’ve seen and 
heard. 
16|And what are you going to do now? You’re going to get up and get ready 
to be baptized and have your sins washed away, after you’ve asked him to do for you 
what he’s best known for[k].’
          
17|”What happened to me after returning to Jerusalem and was praying in 
the temple is that I found myself in a trance. 
18|I saw him telling me, ‘Hurry up 
and get out of Jerusalem—quickly now—because they are not having anything to do 
with what you’re saying about me.’ 
19|I said, ‘Lord, they know that I was going 
from synagogue to synagogue imprisoning and beating those who believe in you. 

20|And when the blood of your advocate and representative[l] Stephen started to be 
shed, I was right there too off to the side, heartily approving and keeping an eye on the 
jackets that the ones who were killing him had taken off.’ 
21|He said to me, ‘Get 
going, because I’m sending you to a far-away nation…’”
          
22|Now they were listening to him attentively up to the previous statement, 
and they then raised their voice singularly and said, “Wipe him off the face of the earth—
a guy like this doesn’t deserve to live!”, 
23|and screamed and went absolutely 
ballistic[m]. 
24|The colonel ordered that he be brought into the base, and said a few 
words for him to be whipped as part of an interrogation, in order to ascertain the reason 
he was being shouted at like this. 
25|As he stretched him out with the leather 
straps positioning him for the scourging, Paul said to the centurion standing there,
      “Is it legal for you all to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t been convicted in a 
court of law?[B]”
          
26|Upon hearing this, the centurion went over to the colonel and reported it, 
“What in the world are you about to do? This here man’s a Roman citizen.”
          
27|The colonel came over and said, “Tell me—are you a Roman citizen?”
      Paul said, “Yes.”
          
28|The Centurion answered, “I acquired this citizenship of mine with a large 
sum of money.”
      Paul said, “But as for me—I was born into mine.[n]” 
29|As a result, those 
who were about to interrogate him immediately backed away. The centurion became 
frightened knowing beyond a shadow of doubt that he’s a Roman citizen and that he 
had been tied up illegally.

[B]Is it legal for you all to whip a Roman citizen who hasn’t been convicted in a court of law?…An 
indication that the Roman Empire of Paul’s time hadn’t yet descended into decadence and immorality, 
in spite of the feuding and turnover of emperors. It’s doubtful that, had this situation occurred in the 
Roman Empire of the fourth century or later, the soldiers would have had any qualms about whipping 
Paul. This statement by Paul, similar circumstances as 16:37, refutes certain preconceived ideas 
connected with “turning the other cheek” (Matt. 5:39). Namely, when Jesus said to turn the other 
cheek, he didn’t mean that a person should not press for what’s rightfully his when being walked over.

Acts
30|A council was convened the following day to ascertain the facts of what 
he was being accused of by the Jews. He let him out, summoned the high priest and the 
councilmen[o] to attendance, brought Paul down from the base, and had him stand before 
them.


&ACTS 23
1|Paul looked intently at the council[a] and said, “Men, comrades, with a good 
conscience in every respect I have lived my life for God[b] up to this day.” 
2|The high 
priest Ananias had the ones standing next to him hit him in the mouth. 
3|Paul then 
said to him, “God’s going to hit you back[c], you bogus judge[d]. And to think that you 
presume to sit in judgment over me according to the Law of Moses, but you hit me 
illegally.” 
4|The attendants who were standing nearby said, “You’re insulting God’s 
high priest,” 
5|and so Paul goes on to say, “I didn’t know, comrades, that he’s a high 
priest. You see, it’s written in Scripture, ‘You shall refrain from speaking ill of a ruler of 
the people.’”
          
6|Realizing that one part of the council consisted of Pharisees but the other part 
consisted of Sadducees, Paul shouted to the council, “Men, comrades, I myself am a 
Pharisee, the very product[e] of Pharisees—I’m on trial for the hope that life after death 
offers[f]!” 
7|Once he said this, a disagreement broke out between the Pharisees and the 
Sadducees, and the majority were split over the issue. 
8|(On the one side of the dispute, 
Sadducees assert that there is no life after death, nor are there angels or spirits[A]; 
whereas Pharisees profess the opposite.) 
9|Heavy back-and-forth shouting took place, 
and so some of the designated teachers[g] who were on the Pharisees’ side stood up and 
said in hot contention, “We find that this man has done no wrong. If a spirit spoke to 
him, or perhaps an angel, …” 
10|With quite a quarrel breaking out, the colonel was 
growing anxious over Paul’s safety lest Paul be torn to pieces by them and ordered a 
company of soldiers to come down out of the base and snatch him from their midst and 
bring him to the base.
          
11|That night[h] the Lord stood over Paul as he was lying in bed and said, 
“Don’t sweat it. You see, just as I kept on telling you in all seriousness about what would 
happen to you in Jerusalem in relation to me, the same thing has to happen to you in 
Rome.”
          
12|When day came, the Judeans formed a cabal and swore an oath amongst 
themselves promising not to eat or drink until they killed Paul. 
13|There were 
more than forty who took this oath as part of the cabal, 
14|and these men 
approached the high priest and the council and said, “We took an oath amongst 
ourselves, swearing that we would be cursed if we break it[i], not to enjoy even a morsel 
of food[B] until we kill Paul. 
15|So have an audience before the colonel now, you 
and the council with you, and petition him to bring Paul down acting as though you’ll be 
investigating his case in detail. We’ll be ready to bump him off before he ever gets close 
to you.”
          
16|Paul’s nephew (his sister’s son) heard about the ambush, was escorted to 
the base, was granted access, and informed Paul. 
17|Paul called one of the 
centurions over and said, “Send this young man to the colonel, as he has something to 
tell him.” 
18|He did indeed take the young man into his custody and brought him 
to the colonel and said, “The prisoner Paul called me over and asked me to bring this 
young man who has something to tell you.”
          
19|The colonel clasped his hand and took him aside so that they could talk in 
private, and proceeded to inquire, “What is it that you have to tell me?” 
20|He 
said, “The Judeans concocted a plot to ask that you bring Paul down tomorrow to appear 
before the council as though some detail about his case is being examined. 
21|So 
then don’t let them talk you into this, as more than forty of their men are in on the plot 
ready to jump him, and these men swore amongst themselves to not eat or drink until 
they bump him off, and they’re ready to go as of this moment, waiting for you to give 
the word.” 
22|So the colonel released the young man and ordered him not to tell 
anyone that he had an audience with him.
          
23|He summoned two of his centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers 
ready to march all the way to Caesarea, plus seventy cavalrymen and two hundred 
javelin-throwers[C], with a departure time of nine in the evening, 
24|and saddle up 
a mule so that Paul will be delivered safely to Governor Felix, since he’ll be mounted.”
          
25|He dictated a letter which reads,


26|From Claudius Lysias, to his excellency Governor Felix: Greetings!

27|The Jews got ahold of this man and were about to kill him, but I came to 
the rescue with my soldiers. Having learned he was a Roman citizen 
28|and 
wanting to get to know the grounds on which they were accusing him, I took 
him to their council. 
29|I discovered that he was being charged for an issue 
involving their law, but nothing that he was being charged with was worthy of 
death or imprisonment. 
30|Now after I received a report that a conspiracy to 
take this man’s life was about to be hatched, I immediately sent him to you, 
commanding his accusers to present their case before you.

          
31|So then the soldiers, following the orders they were given, took Paul and 
brought him to Antipatris over the course of the night. 
32|The next day the infantry 
allowed the cavalrymen to part ways and continue on with him to Caesarea, while they 
returned to base. 
33|Those cavalrymen entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to 
the governor and presented Paul to him. 
34|He read it, asked what province he’s 
from, and found out that he’s from Cilicia. 
*[a]the council…Lit: the Sanhedrin
*[b]for God…Lit: to God
*[c]hit you back…Lit: be striking you. The Gk. verb tense used in the word hit insinuates an open-ended 
retaliation rather than a tit-for-tat retaliation.
*[d]bogus judge…Lit: whitewashed wall. Liberties taken. A commonly-used idiom used in Israel at that 
time. Ref. Matt. 23:27, Luke 11:44.
*[e]very product…Lit: son
*[f]for the hope that life after death offers…Lit: about hope and resurrection of dead people. Hope and 
resurrection is a hendiadys (ref. note of Matt. 3:11). Resurrection of the dead is an idiom meaning life 
after death.
*[g]designated teachers…Lit: Scribes
*[h]That night…Lit: in the night. As the Jewish day starts at sundown, for them it would be the next day.
*[i]swearing that we would be cursed if we break it…In Gk. reads anathemati anethematisamev 
(Ἀναθέματι ἀνεθεματίσαμεν), (Ἀναθέματι/Strong’s 332), (ἀνεθεματίσαμεν/Strong’s 331), which shares 
the same root as the word anathema; and the words are repeated as a figure of speech.

*[A]spirits…Or perhaps: the Holy Spirit. The GT is somewhat ambiguous. The word spirit here is singular in 
the GT, just as the word angels is actually singular (angel). Since angels is singular but the intent is plural, 
logic suggests that the intent for spirit is plural as well. This also is consistent with the usage in v. 9.
*[B]to enjoy a morsel of food…Lit: to taste. This is an expression, as the text simply says taste with no 
predicate supplied. The word taste is used as a metonymy; the entire thing is a figure of speech. This 
helps explains what Jesus said in Matt. 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 20:10 about drinking of the fruit of the 
vine: he meant enjoying the fruit of the vine.
[C]two hundred soldiers in order that they hike all the way to Caesarea, plus seventy cavalrymen and two 
hundred javelin-throwers…Scholars are uncertain what javelin-throwers (Lit: those-who-grasp-with-the-
right-hand) refers to. Perhaps they were Roman velites, younger, less experienced men who served as 
the light infantrymen who threw javelins. By the size of the contingency, the colonel feared a 
confrontation which would escalate into a large skirmish, which might even trigger a revolt. Both the 
cavalry and the velites are fast-moving troops. Apparently, the strategy was to have some troops outrun 
any opposition, getting him on horseback to Caesarea quickly if the need arose.

“when your accusers show up.” He ordered that he be placed under guard in Herod’s 
palace.


&ACTS 24
1|Five days later the high priest Ananias arrived with some councilmen[a] and 
with this attorney named Tertullus. They appeared before the governor in the case 
against Paul. 
2|After being called on, Tertullus began the prosecution of the case 
saying, “A good deal of peace has been obtained because of you and the reforms 
which—owing to your foresight—you’ve introduced into this nation 
3|and which 
have been whole-heartedly accepted by everyone everywhere, your excellency Felix, 
with overwhelming[b] gratitude. 
4|But in order to not waste any more of your time, I 
beg you by the kindness you’re known for to listen for a moment. 
5|You see, we find 
that this plague-of-a-man: #1—is instigating rebellions among all the Jews across the 
civilized world plus is a ringleader of the Nazarene faction; 
6|#2—attempted to 
desecrate the temple; #3—has been arrested.[c]
7|[A] 
8|In regard to all of these affairs, 
you might want to[d] examine them yourself to ascertain what it is we’re accusing him 
of.” 
9|The Jews piled in alleging that this is so.
          
10|And Paul, given the nod from the governor to speak his rebuttal, replied, 
“From many years of being a judge for this nation, all the while being good-natured 
about getting to know the background material of my rebuttal, 
11|you have the 
wherewithal to come to the realization that, from the time I left to travel to Jerusalem to 
worship there, no more than twelve days have gone by. 
12|The Jews have not found 
me wrangling[e] with anyone in the temple or exerting pressure which I fomented out of 
a group of people in the temple, nor doing the same in the synagogues, nor going from 
city to city doing the same, 
13|neither can they present evidence to you pertinent to 
the accusations they’re leveling against me at the moment. 
14|I hereby state the 
following to you: the religious beliefs I adhere to and worship the Father-God with are in 
accordance with ‘the Way’[f] (which they say is a sect of Judaism), in every respect 
exercising faith consistent with the Law of Moses and believing in what’s written in the 
rest of the Old Testament[g], 
15|having hope in God, a hope which they too 
entertain for themselves, a soon-to-be afterlife[h] of the righteous and—well—the 
unrighteous too. 
16|I apply myself to this as well, in order to maintain a blameless 
conscience through it all towards God and towards my fellow comrades.
          
17|”As I had repeatedly over many, many years went to the temple and gave 
donations to the poor among my fellow-countrymen, I arrived in the temple bringing 
offerings and donations. 
18|They found me in the temple with these offerings and 
in a state of ritualistic purification—but did not find me with a crowd or with rioters. 

19|Some of the Jews from the Roman province of Asia—who ought to have to appear 
before you personally and submit accusations if they have some sort of complaint against 
me— 
20|or should be made to state in person before you that they found some 
misconduct that warranted standing me before the council[i]— 
21|unless of course it’s 
all about this one squawk which I shouted out while I stood in their midst, ‘I’m on trial 
before you today over the doctrine of life after death!’—”
          
22|Felix adjourned the proceedings, knowing in detail the ins-and-outs of 
the Way from observation, and said, “When Colonel Lysias manages to get here, I’ll get 
to the bottom of your claims,” 
23|while ordering the centurion to keep an eye on 
Paul while he let him relax and ordering him not to prevent any of his personal 
attendants from attending to his needs.
          
24|A few days later Felix appeared with his wife Drusilla (who was Jewish), 
summoned Paul, and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus. 
25|While he 
was making the case for[e] righteousness, self-control, and the Coming Judgment, Felix 
became frightened and responded, “You’ll have to go now, but when I get the chance, 
I’ll call for you to come back.” 
26|All the while too, he was hoping that he was 
going to get money from Paul; for that reason too, he kept on conversing with him, 
summoning him frequently.
          
*[a]councilmen…Lit: elders
*[b]with overwhelming…Lit: in all
*[c]The GT indicates that items #1, #2, #3 are a comprehensive list of accusations, as indicated by the Gk. 
word kai (καὶ /Strong’s 2532)and the uses of the relative pronouns.
*[d]might want to…Or: might consider; could. Lit: can [in the subjunctive mood]. Like in many languages, 
the use of the subjunctive is out of politeness and respect and avoids the effrontery of being too direct 
when speaking to one in authority.
*[e]wrangling…making the case for…Or: reasoning. This word covers the gamut from discussing, 
reasoning, making the case for, debating, arguing, and wrangling.

the Romans and the Jews.

27|Now his two-year term as governor ended, and Felix was replaced by a 
successor named Porcius Festus, and wishing for the Jews to owe him a favor[B], in the 
transition Felix kept Paul imprisoned.


&ACTS 25
1|So Festus assumed his tenure as governor over the region and went from 
Caesarea down to Jerusalem three days later, 
2|and the chief priests and the leading 
Judeans informed him of the accusations against Paul and proceeded to ask him to step in 

3|and do a favor for them in their case against Paul, that he be extradited to Jerusalem, 
as they were preparing an ambush to bump him off while on the way down. 
4|As a 
result Festus decided to keep Paul in Caesarea, while he himself was planning to leave 
Jerusalem soon. 
5|So he then says, “Let those of you who can make things happen[a] 
accompany me and indict him of crimes[b] if there turns out to be some discrepancy with 
this man.”
          
6|He spent no more than eight to ten days with them and went down to 
Caesarea. The next day he convened court as the presiding judge[c] and called for Paul 
to be brought forth. 
7|When he showed up in court, the Judeans who had come up 
from Jerusalem brought lots of severe[d] charges against him, but the case for any of 
them was not strong enough to stick, 
8|while Paul, speaking in his own defense, said, 
“I have not committed any infraction[e] with respect to the Jews’ Law of Moses, nor with 
respect to the temple rules, nor with respect to Roman law[f].”
          
9|But Festus, wanting to do a favor for the Judeans so they would owe him 
one[g], replied to Paul, “Do you want to go down to Jerusalem and hold the trial for all 
of this down there with me as judge?” 
10|Paul said, “I have taken a stand in the 
Roman court of law, where my trial must be held.[h] I have done no wrong to the Jews, 
as you have come to know so well. 
11|So now, if I am indeed guilty of doing 
something worthy of death, I won’t make excuses for getting the death penalty. But if 
nothing comes of what they’ve charged me with, nothing’s going to make them happy. 
I appeal my case to Caesar.” 
12|After conferring with his council, Festus then 
replied, “You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.”
          
13|Several days went by and King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea 
and greeted Festus and started hanging out with him. 
14|In the course of spending a 
lot of days there, Festus went over the charges against Paul with the king from top to 
bottom, “There’s this man who was left imprisoned by Felix, 
15|concerning whom 
the Jewish chief priests and councilmen[i] tendered a request to me while I was there in 
Jerusalem, asking me to sentence him as though he had been convicted of a crime. 

16|To which I replied that to surrender and hand over[j] a given person before the 
defendant faces his prosecutors[k] in the same physical location and submits testimony in 
his own defense against the charges is not the Roman way of doing things.
          
17|”So they came up here, and without delay I convened court the following 
day, sat in the judge’s chair, and called for the man to be brought in. 
18|When it 
was the prosecution’s turn to present evidence, they kept on accusing him of violating 
the law, while I kept on suspecting that not a single one of the charges was a legitimate 
felony. 
19|They kept on having issues with his religious beliefs and with this 
certain fellow who died named Jesus, but that was all. 
20|I was perplexed about this 
ongoing debate of theirs and kept on asking him if he would like to go to Jerusalem and 
be put on trial down there for these things. 
21|But when Paul appealed his case and 
asked that he be held in custody for the purpose of having the emperor decide the case, I 
ordered that he be held prisoner until I send him over to Caesar.”
          
22|Agrippa said to Festus, “I’ve been wanting to hear what this man has to 
say myself.”
      “Tomorrow,” he said, “You shall hear what he has to say.”
          
23|The next day Agrippa and Bernice—with much fanfare—went and 
entered the audience hall accompanied by a colonel and by prominent men of the city, 
and Festus called to have Paul brought out. 
24|Festus said, “King Agrippa and all 
the men who are joining us: see this fellow whom the overwhelming majority of Jews 
keep hitting me up about in Jerusalem and here as well, shouting that he must no 
longer live? 
25|I’ve been floored by the fact that nothing that he’s done deserves 
the death penalty, but this fellow nevertheless invoked his right of appeal to the emperor, 
to have his case transferred there for trial. 
26|I don’t have anything definite to 
write down on this subject for the head-honcho; therefore I brought him before us and 
especially before you, King Agrippa, so that the inquiry which will take place now 
would result in something I can write to the emperor to be read when he reviews this man’s 
case.

&ACTS 26
1|Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you allowed to speak for yourself?” Paul then put 
his hand up[a] and proceeded to issue a rebuttal: 
2|“In regard to everything I’m 
accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate[b] that I’m going to be 
giving a rebuttal before you today, 
3|especially with you being an expert in anything 
that has to do with the Jewish people and in their issues and disputes as well. Therefore, 
I ask you to patiently listen to me.
          
4|”So now, all the Judeans have known firsthand the way I lived from the time 
I was a youth, namely what happened from the time it all started when I was among my 
fellow countrymen and was living in Jerusalem, 
5|knowing me the entire time then. 
What they would say about it if they were put on the stand to testify is that I lived the life 
of a Pharisee, adhering to the strictness of our religion sect. 
6|At the moment I’m on 
trial standing before you defending myself for the hope of our ancestors’ promises, which 
God caused to come into being; 
7|for a hope which our fellow-countrymen, descendants of 
the same twelve tribes of Israel, are hoping to attain, earnestly performing rituals of 
worship day and night; for a hope for which I’m defending myself from charges which 
the Jews are pressing, Your Highness[c].
          
8|”Why have you all decided that it’s too far-fetched to believe that there’s life 
after death, God causing a person to live in a state of bliss[d]? 
9|Now—yes—I deemed it 
necessary to get personally involved in and actively participate in opposing everything 
Jesus of Nazareth stands for[e], and I did this a lot. 
10|I did this in Jerusalem and 
had many of God’s very people[f] locked up in prison, once I obtained the authority to 
do so from the chief priests, and I cast my vote for them to receive the death penalty. 

11|Going through all the synagogues one after another punishing them on many 
occasions, I kept trying to force them to renounce their faith, and, fuming with rage 
against them, I continuing persecuting them even spilling over into neighboring cities.
          
12|”Engaged in such affairs[g], walking to Damascus with the authorization 
and permission of the chief priests with me, 
13|while on the road at noon, I saw, 
Your Highness, a light coming from the sky overhead—a light brighter than the sun—
shine around me and around my fellow travellers. 
14|All of us fell flat on the 
ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Aramaic[h], “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute 
me? It’s hard to swim against the tide[A].” 
15|I said, “Who are you, sir?” The Lord 
said, “This is Jesus, the one you’re persecuting. 
16|Enough—get up and stand on 
your feet. I became visible to you for this purpose: to appoint you to be an assistant and 
to appoint you to tell others of the truthfulness of[i] both the fact that you saw me and 
what I told you then and that I will be seen[j] by you and you will be told more things. 

17|I’m rescuing you and letting you escape from the Israeli folk-people[k] and from 
the Gentiles and sending you as a missionary to the Gentiles 
18|to open their eyes 
for the one-time turning from darkness to light and from being of the authority of Satan 
to being close to God[B], and for them by faith in me to receive forgiveness of sins and 
their very own piece of the pie, so to speak[l], among the people whom God separated to 
Himself[C] by means of faith.”
          
19|”As a result, King Agrippa, I was not left in a state of disobedience or 
disbelief by the heavenly vision. 
20|On the contrary—I proceeded to tell everyone 
that they must be changing their hearts and their ways[m] and be turning to where they are 
close to God[B] and to perform deeds reflective of[n] a change of heart and of ways, first 
telling this to those in Damascus but not only to them but to those in Jerusalem, to the 
entire Judean countryside, and to the Gentiles. 
21|Because of all of this, the Judeans 
seized me when I was in the temple and proceeded to try to have me killed. 
22|So 
getting the help of that which comes from God up until this moment, I have taken a 
stand[o] and am testifying in court today, letting the insignificant and the great as well 
know the truthfulness of what was going to happen, telling them nothing apart from 
what the prophets (and Moses too) spoke, which I assert is this: 
23|#1—The Messiah 
is capable of experiencing suffering; #2—A prototype of those who come back from the 
dead[p] is going to announce to the Israeli folk-people and to the Gentiles that there is a 
light.”
          
24|While he was still making his rebuttal, Festus said loudly, “You’re crazy, 
Paul! All of that studying you’ve done reading all those books has driven you insane!”
          
25|Paul said, “I’m not crazy, Your Excellency Festus, rather I’m uttering 
sentences consisting of the honest truth and of sanity. 
26|You see, the king, whom 
I’m speaking freely and in a straightforward way to, understands these topics. In fact I 
don’t believe that any of these topics are over his head; the fact is, this new religion called 
‘Christianity’ hasn’t been practiced in a way that it’s been kept in the closet.[q] 
27|Do 
you believe, King Agrippa, in the Bible[r]? From what I’ve seen, I know that you 
believe.”
          
28|Agrippa said to Paul, “In a little way[D] you’re talking me into making 
myself a Christian.”
          
29|Paul said, “Would to God I would persuade in both a little way and in a big 
way, and not just you only but everyone who’s listening to me today, to become like me 
except for the shackles,” 
30|and the king, the governor & Bernice, and those seated 
with them got up, 
31|withdrew somewhere private, and proceeded to talk to one 
another saying that this man has committed nothing worthy of the death penalty or 
imprisonment. 
*[a]put his hand up…Lit: stretched forth his hand
*[b]fortunate…Lit: blessed
*[c]Your Highness…Lit: king
*[d]life after death, God causing a person to live in a state of bliss…Lit: God raises the dead
*[e]everything Jesus of Nazareth stands for…Lit: the name of Jesus of Nazareth
*[f]God’s very people…Lit: the holy saints
*[g]Engaged in such affairs…Lit: in these
*[h]Aramaic…Lit: the Hebrew dialect
*[i]to tell others of the truthfulness of…Lit: witness
*[j]will be seen…Lit: will be made seen, or, will make known by observation
*[k]the Israeli folk-people…Lit: the people. Assumption is that the people are Israelites, as the word is used 
this way in many places in the NT.
*[l]one’s very own piece of the pie, so to speak…Lit: an inheritance
*[m]changing their hearts and their ways…a change of heart and of ways…Lit: to be repenting…repentance
*[n]reflective of…Lit: worthy of
*[o]getting the help of that which comes from God up until this moment, I have taken a stand…Or: getting 
the help of that which comes from God, I have taken a stand up until this day. The text is ambiguous; 
both are true.
*[p]a prototype of those who come back from the dead…Lit: a first out of [the] resurrection of the dead
*[q]the fact is, this new religion called ‘Christianity’ hasn’t been practiced in a way that it’s been kept in the 
closet…Lit: for this hasn’t been practiced in a corner. Some liberties taken. Guessing that the this Paul’s 
refers to is Christianity.
*[r]the Bible…Lit: the prophets. Technically, the OT not including the Law.

*[A]It’s hard to swim against the tide…Lit: It’s hard to kick at [or against] a cattle prod. Liberties taken. This 
is spuriously (but not erroneously) inserted in 9:5 in the Textus Receptus. The metaphor is of a steer or 
some other cattle being jabbed with a cattle prod: the more forceful the prod, the more it hurts the 
steer. When the steer kicks the prod, he hurts himself even more but doesn’t accomplish anything.
*[B]close to God…Lit: upon God. The appearance of the word upon (epi, ἐπί/Strong’s 1909) seems a bit 
idiomatic. The usage of upon is the same as 25:9,26 where Festus asks Paul if he’d like to have the trial 
held “before me” (lit: upon me), and where the word before (epi) is used twice in v. 26: “I brought him 
before us and especially before you.” Other usages, however, like Luke 1:17, “to turn the hearts of the 
fathers to [epi] the children,” suggest exact proximity, as the base definition of epi suggests. Therefore, 
close to is the chosen rendering.
*[C]the people whom God separated to Himself…Lit: God’s saints [separated-ones]. Though this is 
somewhat ambiguous, the assumption is that by the context, the people separated to God refers to the 
Israelites.
*[D]in a little way…Or: in little time…Lit: in [a] little, or, with little. Many scholars take this as a figure of 
speech or reject it in lieu of a different interpretation, one which isn’t obvious. Some render it almost, 
while others render it hardly. I see no reason not to render the remark literally, however.

&ACTS 27
1|As it was decided that we would sail to Italy[a], they proceeded to transfer 
custody of Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, a member of the 
Imperial Battalion[b]. 
2|We boarded a ship in Adramyttium which was about to sail 
down the Turkish[c] coast and hoisted sail, while Aristarchus, a Macedonian from 
Thessalonica, accompanied us. 
3|The next day we stopped at Sidon. Julius did a kind 
deed for Paul and permitted him to go to his friends and receive care for his health. 

4|From there we set out to sea and sailed the long way, on the eastern side of Cyprus, 
because the winds were against us, 
5|sailed through the deep water off the coast of 
Cilicia and Pamphylia, and arrived at the town of Myra in Lycia. 
6|There, the centurion 
found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and we boarded it. 
7|After several days of 
making slow headway, we showed up over in Cnidus. Because the wind wasn’t in our 
favor, we sailed the long way around Crete down the coast of Salmone 
8|and with 
difficulty sailed along the coast and came to some place called Fair Havens, which is 
near a town called Lasea.
          
9|As a good amount of time had gone by, and it being dangerous to travel on 
the Mediterranean Sea because the Day of Atonement was already past (i.e, it was already 
fall), Paul kept on urging, 
10|“Men, I’m looking at what will happen[A], that there’s 
going to be damage and much loss—not only to the cargo and the ship but of our 
lives—on the voyage.” 
11|But the centurion was persuaded more by what the 
helmsman and the captain were saying than by what Paul was saying. 
12|Now since 
the harbor there was unsuitable for passing the winter, the majority decided to hoist sail 
and leave, if perchance they could make it to Phoenix and pass the winter there, which 
is a harbor in Crete which faces southwest and has a northwesterly wind.
          
13|The south wind blew gently; thinking that they had a window of 
opportunity, they lifted anchor and proceeded to sail along the coast of Crete. 

14|But not long after, a hurricane called a “Northeasterly” came down from Crete 
and plowed into them. 
15|As the ship was caught in the wind and couldn’t 
withstand it, they lowered the sails and drifted. 
16|Running under the protection of a 
small island called Cauda, we were just barely able to get the ship under control 
preventing it from smashing into the rocks. 
17|When they raised the waterline of the 
hull, they used cables to support the weight of the ship and hold it together. Afraid that 
they might run aground on the banks of Syrtis, they lowered the anchor and were 
driven about while configured this way.
          
18|Battered by the storm, the next day we proceeded to jettison boxes, jars, 
and cargo containers overboard, 
19|and on the third day we pitched gear and 
tackle. 
20|With neither the sun nor the stars shining for many days and as no small 
hurricane was raging, we abandoned[d] all hope of survival, 
21|and having gone 
without food for a long time, Paul stood up, had them gather around, and said, “Oh 
you guys[e]—you really should’ve listened to me and done as I told you and not put out 
to sea in Crete, and none of this damage and loss would’ve happened. 
22|But now 
I advise you to cheer up; the fact is, none of you is going to lose his life—but the ship 
will be lost. 
23|You see, last night an angel of God[B], whose I am and whom I serve 
and worship, stood by me 
24|saying, ‘Don’t be afraid[f], Paul. You must appear 
before Caesar. And—get ahold of this[g]—God has graciously and freely given a gift to 
you: He will spare the lives of all those sailing with you.’ 
25|With this in mind, cheer 
up, men. You see, I believe in God, that He’ll make it turn out just the way the angel has 
spoken when he spoke to me. 
26|But we’ll have to run aground on some island.”
          
27|Now as the fourteenth night came around, we were drifting about the 
Adriatic Sea, and about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were nearing 
land. 
28|After sounding the depth by dropping a line with a lead weight, we 
measured a depth of twenty fathoms (120ft/37m). A short while later, we measured 
fifteen (90ft/27m), 
29|and fearing that we’d smash against the rocks, we cast four 
anchors off the ship’s stern and began to hope and pray for day to come. 
30|Trying 
to flee the ship, the sailors lowered the ship’s utility boat into the water, pretending that 
they were going to extend the bow’s anchor lines. 
31|Paul said to the centurion and 
the soldiers, “If those guys don’t stay in the ship, you won’t survive.” 
32|The 
soldiers then cut the utility boat’s ropes and let it be driven away.
          
33|Up until daylight was about to appear, Paul kept on encouraging 
everyone to have something to eat saying, “It’s been fourteen days of waiting it out 
now, and we haven’t eaten anything. 
34|With this in mind, I encourage you all to 
put some food in your stomach, as this is for your own well-being and could save your 
life. Fact is, not a single one of the hairs on your head will be lost[C].” 
35|After he 
said this, he took a loaf of bread, offered thanks to God in front of everyone in the 
ceremony done many times before, broke it, and began to eat. 
36|Everyone cheered up 
and partook of food. 
37|All totaled, there were 276 of us onboard the ship. 

38|After they’d eaten, they lightened the ship by throwing the stores of wheat 
overboard into the water.
          
39|When daylight broke, they looked and looked but weren’t making out any 
land which had no rocky shoreline, but they started to notice a bay which had a suitable 
beach, and they got together and decided that it might be possible to run the ship 
aground on it. 
40|They cut the anchors loose and let them sink to the bottom of the 
sea and at the same time disconnected the rudder controls from the rudder, hoisted the 
foresail to utilize the wind, and headed for the beach. 
41|They encountered a place 
where two bodies of water converge and ran the ship aground. While the bow stayed 
firmly planted, the aft on the other hand began to break off from the rest of the ship due to 
the force of the waves. 
42|A plan was put together by the soldiers to kill the 
prisoners, lest any one of them escape by swimming away, 
43|but wanting Paul to 
survive, the centurion thwarted their plan by first of all ordering those who are able to 
swim to the shore to jump overboard and get away, 
*[a]Italy…Lit: Italia. The Roman province of Italia, as there was no “Italy” at that time.
*[b]Battalion…Lit: cohort
*[c]Turkish…Lit: Asian. The Roman province of Asia.
*[d]abandoned…Same word as used in v. 40 to describe the cutting loose of the anchors
*[e]Oh you guys…Lit: oh men
*[f]Don’t be afraid…The Gk. verb tense insinuates that Paul was not afraid at the time the angel spoke to 
him, but is being encouraged not to fall into it.
*[g]get ahold of this…Lit: behold; lo and behold

*[A]looking at what will happen…Lit: look at; behold. The common Gk. word theōreō (θεωρέω /Strong’s 
2334) is used here but in an uncommon way. Since the voyage had not yet taken place and since Paul 
had seen something, one may deduce that Paul had some sort of premonition in which he saw what was 
going to take place.
*[B]angel of God…Generally speaking, the GT of the NT refers to an angel as an “angel of the Lord,” “angel 
of God,” etc., instead of simply “angel.” This is done to clarify the ambiguity between an angel and a 
messenger, as the word means either. But in English, we simply say “angel” instead of the word-for-
word rendering “angel of the Lord.” But in v. 23, Paul takes opportunity of the word God to add 
appositives to which describe his relationship with Him.
[C]not a single one of the hairs on your head will be lost…Seeing that there were over two hundred who 
had to endure the storm and swim to shore, the likelihood that none of them lost a single strand of hair 
is slim. Therefore, Paul’s remark here is an expression, a figure of speech, and not to be taken literally. 
From the sounds of it, this is the same expression as is found in Matt. 10:30; Luke 12:7; what Jesus said 
there can also be understood as an expression and is not to be taken literally.

&ACTS 28
1|Once we were safe, we came to the understanding that the island’s called 
Malta, 
2|and the natives began to shower us with an inordinate amount of kindness: 
you see, on account of the sudden rain coming down on us and the cold, they lit a fire 
and welcomed every one of us. 
3|When Paul gathered a bunch of sticks and put them 
on the fire, a viper fled the heat, sunk his fangs into him, and latched onto his hand. 

4|As the natives saw the viper hanging off his hand, they began to say to one another, 
“This guy definitely was a murderer. He escaped the sea but justice didn’t allow him to 
live.” 
5|So then he shook the viper off into the fire and nothing bad happened to him. 

6|They kept waiting for him to swell up soon or drop dead suddenly. While they 
were waiting and looking, nothing unusual happened to him, and they changed their 
minds and began to say that he’s a god.
          
7|In the area that surrounds that place that they were at was a piece of 
property that belonged to the most prominent person[a] on the island, a man by the 
name of Publius. He took us into his house for three days, extending hospitality to us 
strangers. 
8|Publius’s father came down with on and off fever and dysentery which 
kept forcing[b] him to lie down. Paul went over to him, became acquainted with him[c], 
prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
9|When this happened, everyone else 
on the island who was run down with maladies of some sort[d] started coming to him 
and was being healed or otherwise treated[e]. 
10|They gave us many donatives as 
an allowance[A], and while we were putting out to sea, they put necessities on the ship.
          
11|Three months later we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered on the 
island of Alexandrian, a ship called “Gemini[f].” 
12|After we went up to Syracuse, 
we stayed there for three days. 
13|From there we sailed the circuit[B] and arrived in 
Rhegium. After one day elapsed, a wind came up from the south, and after a second 
day, we went to Puteoli, 
14|where we found fellow-comrades[g], and they cordially 
invited us[h] to stay for seven days. This is the way we arrived in Rome: 
15|The 
comrades then heard what happened to us and went all the way down to the Forum of 
Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and 
strengthened his nerve and stiffened his composure[i]. 
16|Now when we entered 
Rome, Paul was given permission to live by himself and with his guard-soldier.
          
17|What occurred three days later is that he summoned the leading Jews 
together. Once they got together, he proceeded to tell them, “Men, comrades, I, a 
prisoner who was handed over to the Romans back in Jerusalem, did nothing which 
was against the Israeli folk-people or the customs of our forefathers. 
18|The very 
people who examined me kept wishing to set me free because there was no charge 
which I was inherently guilty of which warranted death. 
19|Facing opposition 
from the Judeans, I was forced to appeal my case to Caesar—not that I had any charges 
to press against my fellow countrymen. 
20|So I made the request to see you and to 
talk to you for this reason: you see, it’s because of the hope of Israel I’m wearing these 
chains.”
          
21|They said, “We have neither received anything in writing about you 
from the Judeans, nor have any one of the comrades showed up informing us of 
anything along these lines or saying something bad about you. 
22|We would like to 
hear from you, for you to tell us what your thoughts are; for we certainly do know that 
this sect called Christianity is spoken against by everyone.”
          
23|They reserved a day for him, and many went to visit him and were 
treated to his hospitality, guests to whom he kept on expounding and solemnly stating 
the truthfulness of[j] God’s interaction with mankind (God’s kingdom) and making 
persuasive arguments for them to believe in various things about Jesus and to believe in 
various things from the Old Testament[k] from early in the day until evening. 
24|With 
him using logical arguments, they indeed kept being agreeable to his propositions and 
conceding his points[l], but in spite of that they refused to act in faith and believe. 

25|While in a state of disagreement with one another, they were politely told it was 
time to leave[m] after Paul made a remark in which he said that the Holy Spirit put it 
beautifully when he spoke to our ancestors through the prophet Isaiah,


26|“Go to this people and say,
‘You will hear news of something,
But there’s no way at all that you’ll understand it,
And while looking at something, you will see it,
But there’s no way at all that you’ll gaze upon it.

27|The fact is, this people’s collective heart became lethargic,
And with difficulty they heard that something with their ears,
And they’ve closed their eyes,
Lest they, while using their eyes, might gaze upon something
And, while using their ears, might hear something,
And would understand in their heart 
And would redirect their lives in the right way[n],
And I will heal them when they do.’


28|”So let it be known to you all that this rescue program[o] of God’s was sent to the 
Gentiles; they especially will listen to it.” 
29|[C]
          
30|He lived on his own in a rented house for an entire two years, and 
welcomed as guests[p] anyone coming to interact with him in a friendly visit[q], 

*[a]most prominent person…Lit: the first of the island. Perhaps specific to Malta only, or used when a place 
has no name for the office their leaders occupy.
*[b]forcing…Lit: constraining
*[c]Paul went over to him, became acquainted with him…Lit: Paul entered to him. An idiom; ref. note of 
19:8.
*[d]run down with maladies of some sort…Lit: weaknesses. Ref. note of Matt. 4:23
*[e]healed or otherwise treated…Or: healed. Ref. note of Matt. 4:23 (a different note than previous ref.).
*[f]a ship called “Gemini”…Lit: with a figurehead Dioscuri. Dioscuri is another name for Castor and Pollux, 
the Gemini twins.
*[g]fellow-comrades…Lit: brothers
*[h]they cordially invited us…Lit: we were encouraged from them
*[i]strengthened his nerve and stiffened his composure…Lit: took courage. The word courage here is 
derived from the same verb Jesus used when he encountered the disciples while walking on water 
(Mark 6:50) and has the same meaning.
*[j]solemnly stating the truthfulness of…Lit: witnessing
*[k]the Old Testament…Lit: the Law of Moses and the prophets
*[l]agreeable to his propositions and conceding his points…Lit: being persuaded
*[m]were politely told it was time to leave…Lit: were freed

*[p]welcomed as guests…Lit: received
*[q]coming to interact with him in a friendly visit…Lit: coming into to him. This is an idiom; ref. note of Acts 
19:8.

*[A]They gave us many donatives as an allowance…Lit: They honored us with many honors. In this context, 
the Gk. words to honor and honors draws on a secondary definition which the lexicon says is “a reward, 
present” (the multi-faceted meaning propagated to the English honor vs. honorarium). This is in the 
form of a monetary obligation, pay, or entitlement. That the usage here of honor refers to contributing 
financially is supported by these three facts: First, the words many honors insinuate something which is 
quantitative (cash or items) rather than qualitative (honor or respect). Second, the latter half of v. 10 
(“put necessities on the ship”) also concerns itself with giving material goods. Third, the word honor is 
also used this way in 1 Tim. 5:17.
*[B]sailed the circuit…Some disagreement in the wording of various Gk. manuscripts here, and some 
conjecture from bible scholars as to what exactly Luke means. I’m guessing that this refers to ships that 
shuttled from town to town on short hops which were on a fixed and repeated schedule, competing 
with one another one prices, etc., sort of like how airlines offer flights and compete with one another.
[C]Verse 29 omitted from the better manuscripts



Romans
       Paul, the great pioneer of Christianity, the great theologian of Christian doctrine, makes a 
treatise out of the first half of this long letter to the Romans. 
       The combination of Paul’s mastery of Greek., the customizing of his writing to a non-Jewish 
audience, and his lucid prose make it easy on the translator, as his works can be translated nearly word-
for-word and the result be intelligible enough to serve as the final rendering. Therefore, if one compares 
various works of translations, even the ones which deviate from the traditional, literal rendering, one 
finds that the translations are similar. Paul uses his powerful vocabulary and understanding of the 
grammar to pack nuances into a pithy text, rather than relying on figures of speech like a few of the 
other NT writers do.
       Reasoning, philosophy, and the ability to look at various aspects of difficult questions are Paul’s 
bread & butter. Whereas Jesus’s teachings are remarkably insightful, Paul’s teachings are remarkably 
philosophical—and the first half of Romans is the pinnacle of this. Paul takes the reader on a long, single 
thread until the ninth chapter, when he finally segues to another.
       Since Romans delves into such thought-provoking theological and philosophical topics, the 
approach in translation is akin to the Amplified Bible, a compromise between preserving the literal 
wording and clarifying the end-result. As an analogy, scholars say that the writings of the philosopher 
Immanuel Kant should not be read directly by someone unschooled in the philosophical terminology 
Kant uses, as they will not understand it. This is partly the case with Romans also, as Paul’s multi-faceted 
meaning of his use of, for example, the word law in conjunction with his inclusion or omission of the 
definite article is over the head of the unschooled reader, compounded by the fact that most

article on a word-for-word basis anyways, as the final product in English would be awkward at best.
       To ameliorate this, I’ve preferred a word-for-word rendering of the definite article before law 
and sin in particular and before other words as well because I believe that this is valuable information

essential that the reader get this “unfiltered.” But by doing so, I must sacrifice some readability for 
clarity. To compensate and to fully explain the meaning of the preceding word in conjunction with its 
optionally-included article, immediately following, I add an explanation inside of parenthesis and set off 
by i.e. Generally speaking, if the next occurrence of the word in the same chapter merits the same 
explanatory phrase, I omit the parenthetical note for brevity’s sake, assuming that the reader will 
understand that it’s the same as the previous.

*[C]Verse 29 omitted from the better manuscripts



Romans
       Paul, the great pioneer of Christianity, the great theologian of Christian doctrine, makes a 
treatise out of the first half of this long letter to the Romans. 
       The combination of Paul’s mastery of Greek., the customizing of his writing to a non-Jewish 
audience, and his lucid prose make it easy on the translator, as his works can be translated nearly word-
for-word and the result be intelligible enough to serve as the final rendering. Therefore, if one compares 
various works of translations, even the ones which deviate from the traditional, literal rendering, one 
finds that the translations are similar. Paul uses his powerful vocabulary and understanding of the 
grammar to pack nuances into a pithy text, rather than relying on figures of speech like a few of the 
other NT writers do.
       Reasoning, philosophy, and the ability to look at various aspects of difficult questions are Paul’s 
bread & butter. Whereas Jesus’s teachings are remarkably insightful, Paul’s teachings are remarkably 
philosophical—and the first half of Romans is the pinnacle of this. Paul takes the reader on a long, single 
thread until the ninth chapter, when he finally segues to another.
       Since Romans delves into such thought-provoking theological and philosophical topics, the 
approach in translation is akin to the Amplified Bible, a compromise between preserving the literal 
wording and clarifying the end-result. As an analogy, scholars say that the writings of the philosopher 
Immanuel Kant should not be read directly by someone unschooled in the philosophical terminology 
Kant uses, as they will not understand it. This is partly the case with Romans also, as Paul’s multi-faceted 
meaning of his use of, for example, the word law in conjunction with his inclusion or omission of the 
definite article is over the head of the unschooled reader, compounded by the fact that most 
translations don’t propagate through to the rendered version the inclusion or exclusion the definite 
article on a word-for-word basis anyways, as the final product in English would be awkward at best.
       To ameliorate this, I’ve preferred a word-for-word rendering of the definite article before law 
and sin in particular and before other words as well because I believe that this is valuable information 
that Paul is communicating, that it has a large impact on what he’s trying to convey, and that it’s

1|Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called as a missionary[a], designated to God’s 
good news—the Gospel, 
2|what He promised before over and over through His 
prophets in the Old Testament[b] 
3|about His son, who—physically speaking—came 
into being through the lineage of David, 
4|who was declared in a powerful way to be 
God’s son according to the Holy Spirit due to the resurrection from the dead, namely 
Jesus Christ our Lord, 
5|through whom we’ve received grace and have received a 
missionary assignment that has the end-goal of obedience—a consequence of faith—
among all the Gentiles and the far-off nations on behalf of all he stands for[c], 
6|by 
which you too are called by Jesus Christ:
          
7|To God’s beloved who are holy and called of God who are in Rome: Grace be 
to you—and peace—from the Father-God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
8|First and foremost, concerning you I thank my God through Jesus Christ, 
that the word is being spread about your faith throughout the entire world. 
9|In fact, 
God is my witness, whom I offer a service of worship to in my spirit in the 
evangelization of his son, as I’m constantly making mention of you 
10|every time I 
offer up prayers, asking if somehow, sometime, I will have succeeded by the will of 
God in visiting you. 
11|The fact of the matter is that I long to see you so that I 
might bestow on you a spiritual gift, a gift whose goal is to establish you. 
12|This 
bestowing of a spiritual gift is done to take comfort together with you through the faith 
shared between you and me.
          
13|I don’t want you to be left in the dark, comrades[d], that I purposed many 
times to come to you, but I was prevented from doing so up until now, so that I would 
have the opportunity in the meantime to observe the germination and growth of tangible 
signs of maturity[e] among you as well just I observed it in the other Gentiles— 

14|I’m in debt not just to the civilized but to the uncivilized[f] also, to not just the 
wise but to the foolish also. 
15|This is what motivates me to evangelize to you too 
who are in Rome.
          
16|The fact of the matter is, I’m not ashamed of the Gospel, for it’s God’s 
power in all those who believe for them to end up with salvation (i.e., the state of being 
kept from from spiritual, moral, mental, and physical calamity)—and not just the Jews 
but the non-Jewish Westerners[g] as well. 
17|For in the Gospel God’s righteousness 
(i.e., God’s requirements of how a person must lead his life in order to please Him and 
be approved by Him) is revealed out of faith and back into faith, just as it’s been written 
in the Old Testament, “The one who’s righteous (i.e., the one whose life is to be approved 
by God) shall live out of faith.”
          
18|You see, God’s wrath is unfurled from up in the sky, up in heaven, upon 
ungodliness and unrighteousness inherent in people who withhold the truth in and by 
their unrighteousness, 
19|and it is unfurled because the knowledge of God has 
appeared and been made known to them. 
20|To this point, from the inception of 
human society, His invisible aspects (that is, His everlasting power and divine nature) 
have been clearly seen and understood by means of the things which were created, 
resulting in all humans being without excuse. 
21|Therefore, while knowing and 
understanding God, they didn’t glorify or thank Him as God, but became empty-headed 
in their reasonings instead, and their non-understanding heart darkened. 

22|Asserting to be wise, they became idiots 
23|and exchanged the glory of the 
Immortal God for the facsimile of a Mortal Human and of animals[h].
          
24|So for the aforementioned reasons, as they were wallowing in the desires of 
their hearts, God handed them over to dirty and disgusting unholy things[i] in 
dishonoring and disgracing their bodies among themselves, 
25|the very people 
who, as they were wallowing in the aforementioned lie, swapped the truth of God and 
worshipped and held religious services for the creature, circumventing the Creator, the 
One who is forever blessed (and let us pause a moment for that to sink in[j]).
          
26|On account of this, God handed them over to an unnatural, disgraceful, 
excruciating passion of lust. In this regard, both the women[A] swapped the Natural 
Function for that which circumvents what comes naturally; 
27|and the men[A] too—
and in the same manner—leaving the Natural Function of the woman, burning in their 
longing for one another, men perpetrating the disgraceful deed with[k] men and 
receiving the corresponding reward which they have coming to them and which they 
were bound to receive due to their error, an error which they adhered to among 
themselves.
          
28|And just as they did not approve of retaining the accumulated 
knowledge and understanding of God, God handed them over to an unapproved mind, 
to do what is not fitting to do, 
29|having been filled to the brim with every kind of 
unrighteousness: with wickedness, greed, malice, they are full of envy, murder, strife, 
Machiavellian-styled rivalry, malevolence; they’re gossips and slanderers, 
30|trash-
talkers, God-haters; they’re insolent people, they’re arrogant, they’re braggarts, they 
dream up evil, they rebel against their parents, 
31|they’re dull-witted, treacherous, 
without the natural affection one has for parents, children, nation, etc.; they’re 
unmerciful—

32|The very people who know and understand God’s righteous 
precepts exactly, that those who practice such things deserve to die—not only do they

practice them.


&ROM 2
1|…Which leads to this: who do you think you are, you who[a] pronounces 
judgment over others (i.e., draws conclusions about others for the purpose of writing 
them off)[b]?—There’s no excuse for this. The fact is, in the area in which you judge 
another, you condemn yourself, for the one who’s doing the judging practices the same 
thing[A]. 
2|Now we know for a fact that God renders a guilty verdict in line with the 
truth against those who practice such things. 
3|You rascal[c], you who commits such 
sins and practices such things—do you figure that you’ll evade God’s judgment? 
4|Or 
while despising the riches of His goodness, forbearance and patience, you’re unaware 
that the goodness of God leads one to repentance (i.e., to change one’s heart and one’s 
ways)? 
5|But in accordance with your hard—downright unrepentant—heart, you’re 
accumulating your own individualized-wrath to be regurgitated on that date when wrath 
is unveiled and readily distributed, the day of God’s righteous judgment, 
6|Who “will 
repay every person according to what that person’s done.” 
7|On the one hand to 
those who, in accordance with a consistent pattern of good works, seek after glory, 
honor, and immortality, the repayment will be eternal life. 
8|But on the other hand, to 
those who, out of an attempt to promote themselves by buying influence with God and 
out of not being persuaded and being disobedience to the Truth but are convinced that 
doing unrighteousness is alright, the repayment will be wrath and an outburst of rage— 

9|Distress and anguish for every last person[d] who leads a life of evil, Jews at a higher 
level and non-Jewish Westerners at a level below them.[B] 
10|But glory, honor, and 
peace to all who lead a life of good, Jews at a higher level and Westerners at a level below 
them. 
11|The fact of the matter is that God shows no favoritism.
          
12|You see, anyone at all[e] who sinned without the benefit of possessing a 
law (i.e., a list of God’s rules) will perish; and anyone at all who sins while immersed in a 
law will be judged by that law. 
13|To be clear, it’s not the ones who have heard a 
law and can spout off what it says who are right with God, but the ones who put a law 
into practice will be pronounced righteous by God.
          
14|To this point, when the Gentiles who don’t have a law (i.e., a list of God’s 
rules) instinctively do the things of the Law (i.e., the definitive, comprehensive list of 
God’s rules, which is the Law of Moses), they, though not possessing the Law, are a law 
(i.e., a set of God-given rules) for[f] themselves. 
15|These particular people point out 
what the law written in their hearts (i.e., their particular list of God’s rules written in 
their hearts) has accomplished—and while pointing this out their consciences join in and 
testify even to the extent of arbitrating between the various differing rationales 
condemning or defending— 
16|on whatever day it happens to be when God 
judges the hidden things of mankind through Christ Jesus according to my positive 
message—my Gospel.
          
17|Now if you call yourself a Jew and are fixated on law (i.e., mankind 
possessing and putting into practice the definitive list of God’s rules), boast over (i.e., 
take pride in; swagger over; loudly extol the virtues of; defend vociferously) the things of 
God, 
18|know the will of God, and accept or reject the differing oral traditions of 
interpretation which are derived from the Law of Moses[C]— 
19|and all these to the 
extent that you’ve convinced yourself that you’ve reached the point where you’re a 
guide to the blind, a light in darkness, 
20|a trainer to the foolish, a teacher to the 
young, possessing in the Law of Moses the embodiment of the knowledge and the truth 
of God— 
21|so now, does the one who’s teaching someone else teach himself 
anything? Does the one who preaches to others not to steal steal himself? 
22|Does the 
one who says “don’t commit adultery” commit adultery? Is the one who abhors idols a 
temple robber? 
23|Does the one who boasts in law (i.e., takes pride in—to the point 
of bragging about—his ability to follow the list of God’s rules) dishonor God by the 
transgression of the Law of Moses? 
24|In fact, “God’s reputation[g] is slandered 
among the Gentiles because of you,” like it says in the Bible[h].
          
25|The fact of the matter is that—yes—circumcision (i.e., committing one’s 
life to following the Law of Moses) is beneficial if one were to put the edicts of the Law of 
Moses into practice, but if one were to transgress the Law, his circumcision will have 
become uncircumcision (i.e., as though he never committed himself to follow the Law of 
Moses). 
26|So if the archetypical circumcised man were to keep the edicts of the Law 
of Moses, wouldn’t his uncircumcision count as circumcision? 
27|And the 
physically-uncircumcised man who satisfies the requirements of the Law of Moses will 
judge you, the quintessential transgressor of law (i.e., one who doesn’t fulfill the 
requirements of the list of edicts given by God), a transgressor in the midst of having a 
verbatim copy of God’s edicts and by having signed up to comply with those edicts[i].
          
28|You see, a person is not Jewish because he appears Jewish on the outside, 
nor is circumcision a physical characteristic, 
*[a]who do you think you are, you who…Lit: oh man all who
*[b]pronounces judgment over others (i.e., draws conclusions about others for the purpose of writing them 
off)…Also: decides…Lit: judges. Ref. note of Matt. 7:1.
*[c]you rascal…Lit: oh man
*[d]for every last person…Lit: upon all soul [person] of man. The word soul means person in this context.
*[e]anyone at all…In the GT this is actually plural, not singular
*[f]for…Or: in
*[g]God’s reputation…Lit: the name of God
*[h]like it says in the Bible…Lit: according what’s been written
*[i]in the midst of having a verbatim copy of God’s edicts and by having signed up to comply with those 
edicts…Lit: through letter and circumcision

*[A]the one who’s doing the judging practices the same thing…Paul’s referring to a curious psychological 
condition I’ll call “The Jimmy Swaggert Phenomenon.” The TV evangelist in his heyday in the ‘80’s was 
calling out other ministers for their sexual sins while at the same time visiting prostitutes. What Paul is 
saying here is that, generally speaking, people tend to judge others in the same areas they are guilty of 
themselves.
*[B]Jews at a higher level and non-Jewish Westerners at a level below them…Lit: Jew first and Greek. Since 
Jews were God’s chosen people and since they were given the word of God, Paul’s saying that judgment 
will be harsher on them. But on the flip side, v. 10 says that Jews will receive a higher level of glory, 
honor, and peace for the same reason.
[C]oral traditions of interpretation which are derived from the Law of Moses…Lit: taught-by-word-of-

29|but rather one is Jewish by virtue of 
what’s on the inside, and circumcision is of the heart done by the Spirit not by the letter 
(i.e., by the rigid interpretation and application of God’s edicts); that person’s praise is 
not from people but from God.


&ROM 3
1|So what’s so much better about being Jewish? Put another way, what’s the 
advantage of being circumcised (i.e., being in a covenant to obey the Law of Moses)? 

2|Much and in many ways. First—certainly first—is that they were entrusted with the 
safekeeping and preservation of God’s words[A]. 
3|So now, what if some of them refused 
to have faith and believe? Does their refusal to believe cancel God’s faithfulness?— 

4|Don’t even think about it; think this instead[B]: God is true, but every person is a liar, 
just like it’s written,

…So You’d be absolutely right in Your words
And come out on top in Your judgments

          
5|Now if our unrighteousness causes us to become aligned with the 
righteousness of God, what’s the takeaway[a]? It isn’t that God, Who brings the wrath 
which He’s deemed justifiable upon select individuals, is unfair? (I’m talking about “unfair” 
in terms of human standards of fair and unfair.[b]) 
6|Don’t even think about it[c]—
otherwise, how will God judge the world (i.e., those who are a part of the ungodly 
society which mankind formed)? 
7|But if in the My Fraud Falsehood the truth of God 
proliferates to His glory, why am I still being judged like I’m a sinner, 
8|and not being 
judged according to the way in which we’re being slandered, in which some people are 
saying that our position is: let’s do these things here which are evil[d] in order that these 
things here which are good will come? Their condemnation of our so-called position is 
justified.
          
9|What then? Do we have an advantage? Not entirely. The fact is, we Jews—
and throw in all Westerners[e] too—have been pre-indicted[f] for being dominated[g] by 
sin, 
10|just like it’s recorded in Scripture:

There is no person who’s righteous—not one.

11|There’s no person who understands.
No one seeks out God.

12|All of them veered off in a bad direction;
The whole lot of them is useless.
There’s no one who does good
—Not even a single person.

13|Their throat is an open grave.
They deceive others with their tongues.
Cobra venom is under their lips, under the lips of those

14|Whose mouth cusses and has a bitter taste in it.

15|Their feet are keen to shed blood
(i.e., they are acutely prone to shed blood).

16|Ruin and misery is in their paths
(i.e., for them, ruin and misery is inevitable and unavoidable),

17|And they haven’t discerned a path of peace,

18|There is no fear of God directly in front of their eyes
(i.e., their hearts’ desire is not fascinated
by a deep reverence for God).


19|Now we know that, to the extent to which the Law of Moses touches on points, it 
addresses those who’re up to their neck in the Law, so that everyone would be left with 
nothing to say[h] and the entire world (i.e., the entire established order of humanity) 
would become accountable to God. 
20|Therefore, what comes out of works of law 
(i.e., an attempt to perform the deeds which satisfy the requirements mandated by a list 
of God-given rules) is that not a single living being[i] will be justified before Him (i.e., 
declared “not guilty” in a court of law presided over by God as judge); the fact is, 
through law comes a recognition and a precise knowledge and understanding of sin.
          
21|But as it turns out, righteousness of God (i.e., a venue whereby God will 
approve of how one conducts his life) has been manifested apart from law (i.e., the 
reliance on pleasing God solely based on obeying His list of rules), as it is showcased[j] 
by the Old Testament[k], 
22|a righteousness of God through Jesus Christ-faith to all 
who believe: there is no distinction, you see: 
23|For all have sinned and come up 
short of the glory of God, 
24|while at the same time being offered a gift of being 
justified by His grace through the redemption (i.e., the restoring of a person to his 
original, proper, and designated place) in Christ Jesus, 
25|whom God determined 
before it all started to be a propitiation (i.e., a means of redemption) through faith in his 
blood resulting in a demonstration of His righteousness by the overlooking of the 
previously-committed sins 
26|by the forbearance of God coupled with the 
demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, resulting in Him being just and 
justifying a given person out of and as a byproduct of Jesus-faith.
          
27|So where is the boaster (i.e., the one who brags about his own 
accomplishments)?—he’s been shut out. Through what sort of law (i.e., method of 
attaining righteousness with God)? Through the works-method?—No, but rather through 
a law (i.e. method) of faith. 
28|You see, we figure that a person’s justified by faith 
apart from works of law (i.e. a method of works). 
29|Is God the Jews’ God only? 
Isn’t He the Gentiles’ God too—Yes, He’s the Gentiles’ God too, 
30|if one assumes 
that there is only one true God and that this God is of one mind and has His own will, 
and there is no other being comparable to Him[l], a God who will justify a circumcised 
man (i.e., a person who’s in a covenant to obey the Law of Moses) as a result of[m] faith 
and an uncircumcised man by means of the same faith. 
*[a]what’s the takeaway…Lit: what shall we say

words.
[B]Don’t even think about it; think this instead…Lit: may it never come-into-being; but let God come-into-
being true. Paul’s uses the Gk. verb ginomai (γίνομαι/Strong’s 1096) [come-into-being] twice here. The 
first usage is in an expression (“may it never come-into-being”); the second usage (“but let God come-
into-being true”) is a play on that expression.

1|So what’ll we say about what we’ve discovered about Abraham, our 
forefather physically-speaking[A]? 
2|You see, if Abraham was justified (i.e., examined 
by a judge and declared to be in the right) by[a] works, he has bragging-rights (i.e., he 
has the right to be proud of and brag about his personal achievements); but no—not 
with God. 
3|Taking a closer look, what does the Scripture say?

Abraham had faith in God[B], and it was credited to him as righteousness


4|The agreed-upon pay which the average worker earns is not awarded to him as a 
favor or as a gift to charity but as a debt which is owed and which he must be 
compensated for. 
5|Contrast that to the average worker who instead of being owed a 
wage of righteousness believes in the justification of the ungodly and relies on this 
justification instead: his faith is credited to him as righteousness, 
6|just as David too 
describes the blessings on the person whom God credits righteousness independent of 
works:


7|Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven
And whose sins have been covered over.

8|Blessed is a man to whom the Lord
Will definitely not impute sin.


9|So is this blessing upon the circumcised (i.e., those who’ve made a covenant to obey 
the Law of Moses) or the uncircumcised? The fact of the matter is that we say, “The 
faith peculiar to Abraham was credited to him as righteousness.” 
10|So how was it 
credited? While circumcised or uncircumcised? No—not while circumcised but while 
uncircumcised, 
11|and after being credited with righteous, he had the actual 
circumcision operation done to him[b], a certification of the righteousness of the faith 
which he had while uncircumcised, resulting in him being the progenitor of every 
believer who traverses from uncircumcision (i.e., them being Gentiles and consequently 
having no covenant with God) to their being credited with righteous, 
12|and a 
progenitor of a circumcised person (i.e., a person who’s Jewish and consequently 
follows the Law of Moses) whose righteousness is not derived from circumcision alone 
but is a result of following in the footsteps of the faith that our patriarch Abraham had 
while uncircumcised.
          
13|You see, the promise to Abraham or to his offspring, the promise to be 
the world’s heir, was not by means of law (i.e., a method where one follows a list of 
rules, with the implication of obtaining righteousness from it) but rather through faith-
based-righteousness. 
14|To that point, if a law-based methodology is the means by 
which one lays claim to righteousness and takes possession of it, faith has been made null 
and void, and the promise that was given to Abraham has been nullified. 
15|The Law 
of Moses brings about wrath, you see, but where there is no law (i.e., God-originated list 
of right and wrong), there’s no transgression of that law either.
          
16|By this method, righteousness comes out of faith, so that it would be 
dispensed in accordance to grace, resulting in the certainty of the promise to all the 
descendants of Abraham, not only to those who are based out of the Law of Moses but 
also to those who are based out of Abraham’s faith, who is the progenitor of us all, 

17|just like it’s written in Scripture, “I have positioned you to be a father (i.e., 
patriarch, progenitor) of every nation and of all Gentiles”…positioning him in plain sight 
of (and therefore getting the full attention of) the One whom he believed: God, the One who 
makes the dead alive and calls things which be not as being. 
18|Contrary to hope 
but resting upon hope[c], Abraham believed, resulting in him becoming “a father of many 
nations” according to the quotation, “This is the way your offspring will be.” 

19|Not weakened in faith after fully noticing his own already-lifeless[d] body, 
which by that time had existed for a hundred years or so, and the lifelessness[d] of Sarah’s 
womb, 
20|he didn’t doubt the promise[e] of God by being in unbelief but was 
strengthened in faith instead, after giving glory to God, 
21|convinced that He who 
promised is able also to do what He promised. 
22|This is why “it was credited to him 
as righteousness.” 
23|Now what Scripture says—that righteousness was credited to 
him—was not written for his sake only, 
24|but for our sake too, those to whom it’s 
going to be credited, namely to those believing and laying their trust upon the 
resurrected-Jesus—our Lord raised from the dead, 
*[a]by…Lit: out of
*[b]he had the actual circumcision operation done to him…Lit: he received a sign-type of circumcision
*[c]Contrary to hope but resting upon hope…Lit: against hope upon hope. Contrary to any hope in the 
natural world but resting on hope in the promise of God.
*[d]lifeless…lifelessness…Lit: dead…deadness
*[e]the promise…Lit: at the promise

*[A]discovered about Abraham, our forefather physically-speaking…Or: discovered about Abraham, our 
forefather, according to flesh [i.e., according to his attempts to please God through works]. The text is 
ambiguous.
[B]had faith in God…Lit: believed in God. Paul, quoting from the LXX, uses the dative case for the word 
God, and the dative case when applied to a person after the verb to believe is rendered to believe in; a 
few examples of this are Matt. 21:25; 21:32; Mark 11:31; Luke 20:5. The literal rendering, though 
correct, is misleading and doesn’t agree with the rendering from Hebrew of Gen. 15:4.

25|who was handed over and 
delivered to those who killed him by our sins and was raised by our justification (i.e., the 
process of getting us to where we are acquitted of our sins before God).


&ROM 5
1|So having been justified (i.e., examined by God the judge and declared to be 
righteous) as a result of faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

2|through whom we’ve also arrived at the point where we have the access by faith to 
this grace in which we’ve come to stand and boast (i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in a 
hope[a] of the glory of God.
          
3|Not only that, but we also boast in our affliction, knowing that the affliction 
we experience accomplishes perseverance, 
4|the ensuing perseverance approval (i.e., 
deemed sound as a result of having passed tests), the ensuing approval hope, 
5|and 
the ensuing hope won’t disappoint[b], since the love of God has been poured out in our 
hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
          
6|You see, while we were still weak, even still at the appointed time Christ 
died on behalf of ungodly people. 
7|You see, there’s hardly a person who will die on 
behalf of a person who’s righteous; and maybe someone will muster the courage to die 
on behalf of a good person. 
8|But God’s own love is endorsed to us[c] by virtue of the 
fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners. 
9|So now that we’ve 
been justified by his blood, we’ll all the more be spared from the wrath which is due us 
through him. 
10|You see, if we were reconciled to God through the death of His 
son while we were enemies, now that we’ve been reconciled, we’ll all the more be 
spared, preserved, and kept intact by his life. 
11|Not only that but we’ll also boast 
(i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we at 
this time have received the previously stated reconciliation.
          
12|Throughout this all, just as sin entered the world through one man and 
death (i.e., stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction) through the sin 
which entered, and in this way death propagated to all men, seeing that[d] everybody has 
sinned— 
13|the fact is, up until law (i.e., an enumeration of God’s commandments) 
was given, sin was in the world (i.e., the established order of human beings), but sin is 
not transacted and counted against a person[A] when law doesn’t exist. 
14|That 
aside, death reigned from Adam until Moses[B] and it also reigned over those who didn’t 
sin by committing the same transgression that Adam committed, who is a prototype of 
and symbolic of all human beings who come after him.
          
15|But put that aside. The gift of grace doesn’t operate the same way as the 
initial transgression: for if the many died (i.e., were transformed into a state of spiritual 
death, resulting in their lives becoming a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and 
destruction—culminating in physical death itself) by the single transgression, all the 
more did the grace of God and the unrequited-gift overflow[e] to the many by grace, by 
the one man Jesus Christ. 
16|But the unrequited-gift doesn’t operate the same way 
as the affair with the lone person who sinned: on the one hand the judicial review which 
came out of an incident involving a single person resulted in condemnation, but on the 
other hand the grace which came out of many transgressions resulted in an act of 
righteousness.
          
17|Put another way, if by the transgression of the singular person death 
reigned through the singular person, all the more will they who receive the abundance 
of the grace of God and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the singular person 
Jesus Christ. 
18|So then, just as condemnation came to every person as the result of 
one transgression, in the same way one act of righteousness resulted in making 
available to every person the ability of to have the slate of his entire life wiped clean[f]. 

19|For just as through the disobedience of the singular person the many were 
declared by imposition to be sinners, in the same way too through the obedience of the 
singular person the many are declared by imposition to be righteous. 
20|But law 
(i.e., the expectation of living up to the standards imposed by a list of right and wrong) 
slipped in, sneaking in unplanned as though crashing a party, in order that the 
transgression seeded by Adam and propagated to the entire human race would multiply; but 
if the sin which was seeded multiplied, grace multiplied even more so, 
*[a]boast (i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in a hope…Lit: boast upon hope
*[b]won’t disappoint…Lit: won’t be ashamed
*[c]God’s own love is endorsed to us…Lit: God commends His love to us. The Gk. word for commend was in 
ancient times used when someone introduced a person whom he recommends to someone else, with 
the intention of the two becoming friends or joining together in a common cause.
*[d]seeing that…Lit: at which
*[e]overflow…Also: abound
*[f]to have the slate of his entire life wiped clean…Lit: justification of life

*[A]transacted and counted against a person…Lit: charged to one’s account; imputed. Paul says here and 
elsewhere that sin cannot take place without God having published a list of His commandments. God 
doesn’t count deeds done in ignorance as sin. This is why when toddlers die, they don’t face 
condemnation: toddlers aren’t old enough to comprehend the commandments. It also explains Gen. 
4:15, where God didn’t kill Cain for killing Abel but said he’d kill anyone who killed Cain.
[B]death reigned from Adam until Moses…Paul is referring to the timeframe before the ultimate law, the 
Law of Moses, was delivered to the people. Even without the Law, which is the ultimate, definitive list 
compiled by God of what sin is, sin managed to wreak its devastation (i.e., death) during that time. Paul 
said a verse earlier that sin is not transacted (imputed) where law doesn’t exist; but he’s clarifying that 
remark by saying that sin indeed reigned in spite of the Law of Moses not existing.

&ROM 6
1|So what’s there to say about this[a]? Shall we dwell in the sin inherent in all 
humans so that more and more grace will come of it?— 
2|Don’t even think about it[b]. 
We—the very people who died (i.e., were transformed into a state of spiritual death, 
resulting in our lives becoming a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and 
destruction) in the sin[c] inherited by all humans—how will we live in it still? 
3|Or are 
you ignorant of the fact that any person at all who was baptized into Christ Jesus (i.e., 
was initiated into a total dedication to Christ Jesus) was baptized (i.e. was initiated) into 
his death? 
4|So we were buried together with him through the baptism ritual symbolic 
of a total dedication to Christ resulting in death, in order that, just as Christ was raised 
from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too in like fashion would go about in 
a brand-newness of life. 
5|You see, if we’ve become united together in a way which 
replicates his death[d], then certainly we will also be a product of the resurrection, 

6|knowing this: that our old-self[e] was jointly-crucified, so that the body of sin (i.e., 
the sinful propensity incumbent to our human nature[A]) would be done away with, 
done away with in respect to us slaving in the sin[c] inherited by all humans: 
7|for he 
who’s died has been justified from (i.e., cleared of; absolved of) the sin.
          
8|Now if we jointly-died with Christ, we believe that we’ll also jointly-live with 
him, 
9|knowing for a fact that, now that he’s been raised from the dead, Christ won’t 
die anymore[f]: death no longer has control over him. 
10|The fact is, what[g] died 
died once and for all in the sin inherited by all humans; what lives lives in God. 
11|In 
the same way we also consider ourselves to be, on the one hand, dead in the sin, but on 
the other hand living in Christ Jesus.
          
12|So don’t keep on letting sin reign in your mortal bodies (i.e., the part of 
you which hosts carnal desires during your life here on Earth) to where you obey its 
sinful desire, 
13|nor put your body parts (i.e., your physical body parts, each part 
being a metonymy for various activities one engages in. In this case, each part is a 
metonymy for this or that sin, the whole comprising your personal carnal signature) in 
a place where they’re available to be used as tools, mechanisms, or weapons of 
unrighteousness in the sin inherent in all humans, but instead put yourselves in a place 
where you’re made available in God as alive from the dead and your body parts as 
tools, mechanisms, and weapons of righteousness in God. 
14|To this point, sin will 
not control you; you see, you’re not under the jurisdiction of law (i.e., your life is decided 
by a list of do’s-and-dont’s) but under the jurisdiction of grace instead.
          
15|So now[h]…shall we sin since we’re not under the jurisdiction of law but 
under the jurisdiction of grace instead?—Don’t even think about it[i]. 
16|You ought 
to know[j] that whatever thing you make yourself available to be used by—used to the 
point of being obedient to—you’re enslaved to, a slave of either sin culminating in death 
or obedience culminating in righteousness. 
17|God is so good[k]: you were slaves of 
sin, but you whole-heartedly obeyed what was presented to you in a clear, orderly, and 
systematic way[l]: the particular kind of instruction which has you walking in the 
righteousness of faith rather than just following a set of rules; 
18|having been freed from 
the sin inherent in all humans, you were enslaved by righteousness.
          
19|The subject I’m talking about is the human condition and human 
experience on account of the weakness of your flesh (i.e., of your lack of self-ability 
apart from God; of that part of you which has carnal desires; of that part of you which 
fails to live up to God’s standards). You see, just as you made your body parts available 
to be used as slaves in the filth and degradation[m] of carnality and in an artifact of sin, 
namely the refusal to be restrained by any laws, rules, or codes of conduct, which leads 
to even more of the same[n], in like fashion make your body parts available at this time to 
be used as slaves by the righteousness which is a consequence of faith which leads to 
holiness[o]. 
20|The fact is, when you were yet slaves of sin, you were free with 
respect to living in righteousness.
          
21|So what final result did you obtain back then, based on the things which 
you’re now ashamed of? The fact of the matter is that those things end in death. 

22|But as things stand now, on the one hand having been freed from the sin inherent 
in all humans but on the other hand having become slaves in God, you’re getting holiness 
as your final result on the one hand, but you end up with eternal life (i.e., that special 
fullness of life) on the other. 
*[a]what’s there to say about this…Lit: what shall we say
*[b]don’t even think about it…Lit: may it not be

which compares the communication of a teaching to the transfer of the custody of a prisoner from one 
party to another.
*[m]filth and degradation…Lit: uncleanness. Rooted in the uncleanness defined by the Law of Moses.

*[o]by the righteousness which is a consequence of faith which leads to holiness…Lit: in the righteousness 
unto holiness. This is a parallel construct to the previous phrase in the lawlessness unto the lawlessness.

[A]the sinful propensity incumbent to our human nature…Lit: the body of sin. The perspective which 
comes out of the NT is that the carnal nature present in all people is a component of the physical body; 
therefore, the words body and flesh can or will, depending on the context, refer to the carnal nature, 
rather than the physical body itself. The words body and flesh are used this way throughout the chapter.

&ROM 7
1|Or are you unaware, comrades[a] (and I’m speaking to those of you who’re 
familiar with the operative details of a law-code), that the Law of Moses exercises control 
over a person only during that person’s lifetime? 
2|To this point, a married woman[A] 
(who owing to marriage laws is under the authority of her husband, who has the legal right to 
initiate a divorce—but not she) is legally bound to her husband while he’s alive. If the 
husband were to die, then-and-only-then will she be released[b] from her legal constraint 
to her husband. 
3|So then, while her husband’s still alive, she’d be officially labeled 
an adulteress if she were to get married (and therefore under the authority of and bound to) 
to another man[c].
          
4|In the same way, my fellow comrades, through the body of Christ you too 
have been put to death in relation to the Law of Moses resulting in you having come into 
being under the authority of and bound to another—to him who’s been raised from the 
dead—in order that you would produce aftereffects[d] in God. 
5|You see, when you 
were in the flesh (i.e., trying in and of yourself to live up to God’s rules while at the 
same time beholden to your carnal nature), the passions of the sins pervasive to mankind, 
those things that, on account of the Law, were repeatedly at work in our body parts (i.e., 
your personal carnal signature) resulting in the production of aftereffects in death (i.e., 
in a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction).
          
6|But as things stand now, we’ve been released[e] from the Law of Moses, 
having died to that which kept holding us down, so that we serve in newness of spirit[B] 
(i.e. walking in line with and dominated by a regenerated human spirit, which is in 
communion with the Holy Spirit) and not oldness of letter (i.e., a strict, literal, exacting 
interpretation of the verbatim Law of Moses, along with a grueling, rigid adherence 
done the “old way”—out of a person’s self-ability).
          
7|So what’s there to say about this[f]? Are we to conclude that the Law of Moses is 
characteristic of and has the quality and nature of sin?—Don’t even think about it[g]—on the 
contrary I would not have come to know, recognize, and understand the sin pervasive to 
mankind if not through law (i.e., by conducting my life under the weight of a long list of 
God-ordained rules); for indeed I would’ve come to know this first-hand had not the 
Law of Moses kept on telling me over and over[C], “Thou shalt not covet such-and-such[D].” 

8|Sin took advantage of the situation through the commandment “thou shalt not covet” 
and worked utterly in me every sort of coveting imaginable[h]: you see, apart from law 
(i.e., being forced to obey a list of rules) sin is dead. 
9|In the past I was alive and living 
apart from law; but the commandment came and the sin of coveting which I just 
mentioned sprang to life; 
10|I died. It became evident in me that the 
commandment—the same one leading to life—was leading to death. 
11|To be more 
specific, the sin of coveting through the commandment took advantage of the situation, 
fooled me completely, and killed me (i.e., caused me to die spiritually) by this. 

12|Consequently, the Law of Moses is indeed holy, and the commandment “thou 
shalt not covet” is holy and just and good.
          
13|So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?[E]—
Don’t even think about it[g]; on the contrary, in order that the nature and devastation of sin 
would become apparent, sin utterly worked death through the good in me, so that the 
sin of coveting would reach its maximal efficacy[i] through the commandment “thou shalt 
not covet.” 
14|You see, we know for a fact that the Law is intrinsically spiritual; I 
am fleshly (i.e., the nature of my physical body is that it is susceptible to carnal 
temptations, and that part of me does not want to serve God), having been sold by the 
sin pervasive to mankind: 
15|I don’t understand nor do I recognize what it is that I’m 
getting done; the fact of the matter is, I’m not putting into practice what I want—I’m 
doing what I hate instead. 
16|But if I’m doing what I don’t want to, I concur with 
the Law of Moses, concurring that it’s good. 
17|At this point, though, it’s no longer 
me personally accomplishing this but rather the sin which inhabits me.
          
18|You see, I know for a fact that good does not inhabit me, that is, in my 
flesh (i.e. in my human, carnal nature); for the wanting is present in me, at hand ready 
to jump in, but getting the good done is not happening. 
19|In fact, I’m not doing 
the good that I want to do, but instead, I’m doing the bad which I don’t want to do and 
doing it on a day-to-day basis. 
20|Now if what I don’t want to do is the thing that 
I’m doing, It’s no longer me producing the finished product but the sin which inhabits 
me is producing it instead. 
21|I’m discovering the Law of God (i.e., the principle that 
one should do right and live according to God’s will), then, with the wanting in me to 
do the good, because the bad is present in me, ready to rear its ugly head; 
22|you see, 
I delight in the Law of God with respect to the inner-person, 
23|but I see another 
law (i.e., a different principle) in my body parts (i.e., in my unique carnal signature) 
waging war against the law of my mind (i.e. against the principles by which my mind 
operate), defeating me and making me a prisoner of the sin which exists in my body 
parts. 
24|What a miserable person I am: who’ll rescue me from this body which is 
rooted in death?— 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]then-and-only-then will she be released…Lit: she has been released. The perfect tense is the reason for 
the extrapolation then-and-only-then.
*[c]bound to a different man…Lit: [with] a different man. The dative case of different man is same case as 
to her husband in v. 2, and refers to the same thing; hence the interpolation.
*[d]produce aftereffects…Lit: bear fruit
*[e]released…As this is the same word used in v. 2, Paul is connecting the analogy of a wife who’s released 
from her marriage to us being released from the Law.
*[f]what’s there to say about this…Lit: what shall we say
*[g]don’t even think about it…Lit: may it not be. Ref. note of Rom. 3:4.
*[h]every sort of coveting imaginable…Lit: all covetings. A figure of speech. 
*[i]would reach its maximal efficacy…Lit: would become exceedingly sinful
*[j]God is so good…Lit: grace [kindness, mercy, benevolence] with [also to] God

*[A]married woman…Lit: the under-man woman. The GT is saying that she’s under the power of a man. 
According to the Law of Moses, only a man could initiate a divorce. Ref. note of Matt. 5:31.
*[B]newness of spirit…Paul’s intentional omission of the definite article before spirit (and for that matter, 
before law) refers to the way in which a believer conducts his life. It does not specifically refer to the 
Holy Spirit per se, but instead refers to a lifestyle where one walks with the Holy Spirit. Some 
translations assume that the definite article is implied (which there are plenty of examples of such 
implied definite articles in other NT prepositional phrases), and therefore spirit here refers to the [Holy] 
Spirit. They point to 2 Cor. 3:6 as corroborating evidence. I disagree; Paul is consistent and precise in his 
inclusion or exclusion of definite articles in the preceding chapters of Romans, and he would’ve explicitly 
added one to specify Holy Spirit for the purpose of resolving the ambiguity he most certainly would’ve 
foreseen.
*[C]the Law of Moses kept on telling me over and over…Lit: the Law was saying (where was saying is an 
imperfect verb tense). Unlike other NT writers (Mark comes to mind), and also because his epistles are 
treatises and not story-narratives like the Gospels, Paul uses the imperfect tense sparingly. This usage 
here feels as though Paul is being reminded of this over and over in his head, rather than seeing it 
appear over and over again in the Law.
*[D]Thou shalt not covet such-and-such…Lit: you shall not long for. The word long for comes straight out of 
Exod. 20:17 in the LXX, so a reader in ancient times who was familiar with the LXX OT would 
immediately recognize this reference to the Ten Commandments.
[E]So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?…Or: So death became 
something which is good in me, right?…Lit: So death became good in [or: with; to] me. The word death is 
in the nominative case and good is either nominative or accusative, and for the GT to fit into a strict 
grammar parsing, the English translation must put death as the subject and assume good is accusative 
rather than nominative, meaning that good takes the predicate rather than the subject. The rendering 
with death as the subject and good as the predicate doesn’t make sense, hence other translations (NASB 
translates this, “that which is good became a cause of death for me”), change this according to the 
context. This means Paul made a mistake when he wrote this—a single-letter slipup, as thanatos (death, 
θάνατος/Strong’s 2288) need only be changed to thanaton (θάνατόν). On a side note, J.B. Phillips 
believed that Paul made a mistake in 1 Cor. 14:22a (ref. note).

rather than nominative, meaning that good takes the predicate rather than the subject. The rendering 
with death as the subject and good as the predicate doesn’t make sense, hence other translations (NASB 
translates this, “that which is good became a cause of death for me”), change this according to the 
context. This means Paul made a mistake when he wrote this—a single-letter slipup, as thanatos (death, 
θάνατος/Strong’s 2288) need only be changed to thanaton (θάνατόν). On a side note, J.B. Phillips 
believed that Paul made a mistake in 1 Cor. 14:22a (ref. note).

Romans
25|God is so good[j] through Jesus Christ our Lord!—So then 
me—on the one hand I’m enslaved in mind to a law of God (i.e., to a principle set in 
place by God), but on the other hand I’m enslaved in flesh to a law of sin (i.e., to a 
principle of sin caused by carnality).


&ROM 8
1|Therefore, there’s nothing of condemnation now with those in Christ Jesus: 

2|The law of the spirit of life (i.e., the principle of living a spiritual life in communion 
with the Holy Spirit) set you free from the law of the sin which afflicts mankind and the 
ensuing death (i.e. the principle of sin coming about due to our human nature and the 
resulting stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction). 
3|You see, the 
inability of the Law of Moses in that it was continually weak through the flesh (i.e., 
through human ability alone apart from God and aggravated by human carnality), God 
sent His very-own son in sinful-flesh form and, in regard to sin, condemned the sin in 
the flesh, 
4|so that the decrees of the Law of Moses would be fulfilled in us, in those 
who’re not going about their day-to-day business according to flesh (i.e., according to 
their own ability apart from God and according to their carnal nature) but rather 
according to spirit (i.e., according to a spiritual life, a life in communion with the Holy 
Spirit). 
5|For those whose existence is in accordance with the nature of the flesh think 
about the things of the flesh; those whose existence is in accordance with spirit (i.e. with 
living a spiritual life) think about the things of the Spirit. 
6|The fact of the matter is that 
the flesh-mindset is death; the mindset of the spirit is life and peace. 
7|Therefore, the 
mindset of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it doesn’t submit to the Law of God; in fact, 
it can’t do so: 
8|Those existing in flesh can’t please God.
          
9|You aren’t in flesh (i.e., live out of your natural ability and through your 
carnal nature) but in spirit (i.e., live out of a regenerated human spirit in communion 
with the Holy Spirit), if God’s Spirit in fact dwells in you. (If a given person doesn’t 
have Christ’s Spirit, that person’s not a part of him and from him[A].) 
10|Now if 
Christ is in you—yes—the body is dead through sin, but the spirit has life and is alive 
through righteousness. 
11|If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead 
dwells in you all, He who raised Jesus from the dead will also invigorate[a] your mortal 
bodies through the Indwelling Spirit in you.
          
12|So then, comrades[b], we have an obligation—but not to the flesh—we’re 
not to live according to flesh. 
13|If you live according to flesh, you’re going to die 
(i.e., experience spiritual death), you see; but if by spirit you put to death the practices 
of the body, you’re going to live. 
14|The fact is, any people—any people at all—
who’re led by the Spirit of God: these people are sons of God. 
15|In fact, you have 
not received a spirit (i.e., a prevailing disposition) of slavery resulting in fear again; 
instead, you’ve received a spirit of adoption, one with which we cry out, “Papa[c]! 
Father!” 
16|The Spirit himself in conjunction with our spirit[B] jointly declares that 
we are children of God. 
17|If children, heirs too—heirs of God indeed; joint-heirs of 
Christ’s inheritance, if indeed we jointly-suffer with him in order that we too would be 
jointly-glorified.
          
18|Regarding this point, I figure that the present-day sufferings aren’t even 
in the same ballpark as the glory that’s going to be revealed to us. 
19|In fact, the 
creation is in suspense waiting for the sons of God to break onto the scene[d]. 

20|You see, the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly of course—no—it 
was subjected on account of whoever or whatever subjected it, resting upon hope[e] 

21|that the creation itself will be set free from the slavery of corruption (a 
corruption like decomposing organic matter) over to the freedom of the sons of God. 

22|Regarding this, we know from first-hand experience that every bit of the 
creation moans and groans in unison and is in agony in unison from the time it was first 
corrupted up to now. 
23|Not only does the creation moan, groan, and agonize but so do 
those who have a token sample of celebration[C] of the Spirit—namely us—we too moan 
and groan within ourselves in suspense waiting for an adoption, the redemption of our 
body (i.e., the restoration of the body to its original purpose and function and the 
elimination of the carnal nature). 
24|In fact, we were saved by hope; hope which is 
seen (i.e., is of something which verifiably exists in the physical world) isn’t hope—just 
who hopes for what he sees? 
25|Now if we hope for what we don’t see, we’re in 
suspense awaiting it, exercising perseverance throughout.
          
26|In the same way, the Spirit helps us (i.e., he gets ahold of something in 
unison with us against that something) with our weakness: you see, we don’t know 
how we must pray or what we must pray; instead of us being constrained by that 
limitation, when he intercedes on behalf of others[D], the Spirit himself intercedes (i.e., he 
personally acts on another’s behalf by joining up with him in order to obtain a goal, to 
hit the mark like an arrow hitting its target, like a baseball player who gets a good solid hit on 
a ball putting it in the spot he’s chosen) with moans and groans which can’t be put into 
speech. 
27|The one who searches the hearts knows for a fact the thoughts, 
opinions, and intentions of the Spirit, since he intercedes on behalf of[D] people set apart 
for God[f]. 
28|We know for a fact that God works all things in unison[E] towards a 
good goal for them who love God, those who exist as the according-to-purpose called-
ones, 
29|since they whom He foreknew (i.e., knew one’s individual personality, 
nature, and spiritual acuity before it became apparent), he foreordained[F] to conform to 
the image of His son, resulting in him being firstborn among many comrades and 
brothers. 
30|Those whom He foreordained, He also called (i.e., summoned to 
believe in Him). And those He called, He also justified (i.e., declared “not guilty”); those 
He justified, He also glorified.
          
31|So what’s the takeaway?[g]—If God’s on our side[h], who’s on the 
opposing team? 
32|He who certainly didn’t spare His own son, but surrendered 
him to crucifixion on behalf of us all, how will He not freely and willingly give us all 
things? 
33|Who will press charges against those chosen by God, those in God’s 
church? God’s doing the justifying (i.e., God’s the one Who’s issuing the “not guilty” 
verdicts); 
34|who’s issuing the guilty verdicts? Is the person who’s issuing the guilty 
verdicts Christ Jesus, the fellow who died, but—beyond that—was resurrected? The fellow 
who’s also God’s chief executive[i], the fellow who also intercedes on our behalf? 

35|What[G] will separate us from the love of Christ—
tribulation…distress…persecution…famine…nakedness…danger…sword (i.e., 
another’s imposition of brute force upon you even to the threat of death)? 
36|Just 
as it’s written:

We’re being put to death all day long for Your sake
We’ve been slated for slaughter as though we’re sheep of slaughter


37|No—in all these things we come out on top conquering through the one who 
loved us. 
38|In fact, I’ve reached the point where I’m persuaded that neither death 
nor life nor Satan’s agents nor demon-chieftains[H] nor present-events nor future-events 
nor unexplainable, supernatural, or miraculous powers[H], 
*[a]invigorate…Lit: make alive
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]Papa…Lit: Abba. The Aramaic word for father. The Roman Gentiles, the audience of this epistle, 
must’ve not only known this word but appreciated the intimacy it conveyed.
*[d]In fact, the creation is in suspense waiting for the sons of God to break onto the scene…Lit: For the 
eager expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God
*[e]resting upon hope…Lit: upon hope. Repetition of upon hope in Rom 4:18, against hope upon hope
*[f]people set apart to God…Lit: saints. Holy people is what saints means literally. Holy also means set 
apart. The saints are God’s people, those who obey Him, those who walk in His ways.
*[g]So what’s the takeaway?…Lit: So what shall we say?
*[h]on our side…Lit: on our behalf
*[i]God’s chief executive…Lit: at the right hand of God. Ref. notes of Matt. 22:24, 26:64.

*[A]a part of him and from him…Lit: of him. Any person who has the Holy Spirit in them is a believer.
*[B]The Spirit himself in conjunction with our spirit…A clear summary of Paul’s usage of the word spirit in 
this chapter and in his other epistles. As the GT doesn’t use capital letters, it isn’t always obvious 
whether Paul is referring to the Holy Spirit or to the regenerated human spirit—or to both. The context 
in addition to the inclusion or omission of the definite article (in line with rules for definite articles) is the 
only way of deciding.
*[C]a token sample of celebration…Lit: the first-fruits. The Gk. word aparchā (ἀπαρχή/Strong’s 536). Also 
used in Jam. 1:18. While the word aparchā refers to the classical Gk. pagan offering of the first produce 
of the harvest, we assume Paul and James are referring to the wave offering of Lev. 23:9–11. In both 
cases, a first-fruit offering is a small sample of the year’s harvest—the most excellent sample 
obtainable—a token which is offered at harvest time to God (or the god) from whom is credited for 
causing the bountiful harvest. The first-fruits is the following: (a) a recognition and remembrance that 
God’s blessing, and not simply man’s labor, is the reason the crops grew and that there is a harvest; (b) a 
celebration of the harvest; (c) a time of thankfulness like the Thanksgiving holiday in the US; (d) a 
holiday which marks a change in the calendar year; (e) the end of a season of work and an 
acknowledgement of the work done during that season; (f) the very best of the best. When the word 
aparchā is used in the NT, it refers to one, to several, or to all of these.
*[D]intercedes on behalf of others…intercedes on behalf of…In the GT, the word intercedes in v.26 begins 
with the preposition huper (ὑπέρ/Strong’s 5228) used as a prefix. In v. 27, intercede does not begin with 
huper; instead huper is used right after intercede as an ordinary preposition, rendered on behalf of. This 
is why intercedes on behalf of others was added to v. 26: it captures the differences between intercedes 
as they appear in vv. 27,28.
*[E]God works all things in unison…Or: all things work in unison. The principal manuscripts are split fairly 
evenly between these two renderings, with the two oldest ones favoring God works everything in 
unison. Some claim that this verse says that God is the instigator of bad things, causing them to happen 
so that He can work them to do good; this may have been the reason why manuscripts were altered 
centuries ago. This verse does not say what the cause of bad things is; it simply says that if and when 
things occur—bad things included—God then works them for good. Since v. 31 says “if God’s on our 
side,” then it stands to reason that God is not the cause of bringing bad things into believers’ lives, 
otherwise, that would constitute Him being against them rather than for them.
*[F]foreordained…The word’s Gk. root means: to mark out the boundaries; to lay down; to mark out; to 
determine; to appoint; to settle; to assign. The prefix means ahead of time. Concatenating the meanings 
of the prefix and the root gives one a clearer idea of what foreordain means. 
*[G]what…Lit: who. Paul’s using a figure of speech, a personification, to refer to the items which he 
proceeds to list, as though each item is a person. The items listed are delimited by ellipses in an effort to 
convey this figure of speech to the reader.
[H]Satan’s agents nor demon-chieftains…unexplainable, supernatural, or miraculous powers…Lit: angels 
[messengers; agents] nor rulers…powers. All the items in the list are of incorporeal things. It can be 
understood with no doubt that the word angel here refers to demonic agents; ref. 2 Cor. 12:7 for 
confirmation. As the introductory word angel speaks of demonic forces, it’s safe to assume that rulers 
refers to demonic forces as well. This is also confirmed by the word’s usage in Eph. 6:12 and Col. 2:15. 
The justification of adding the descriptive words unexplainable, supernatural, or miraculous before the 
word powers is (in addition to the other items being incorporeal) the way powers is used in Matt. 4:12; 
Mark 6:2; 9:39 to refer to miracles, and in Matt. 24:29 to refer to the stars.

&ROM 9
1|Truthfully, I’m telling you in Christ—I’m not lying—my conscience attests to 
the fact in conjunction with the Holy Spirit 
2|that I have tremendous sorrow and 
incessant pain in my heart: 
3|that is, that I would be granted this request[a], that I—
even I—be accursed and shunned by the Messiah, the Christ, for the sake of my 
brethren[b], my flesh & blood relatives 
4|(the ones I’m referring to are the Israelites), 
they who have the Lineal Descent Selection[c]; the Shekhinah-Glory[A] (i.e., God 
manifesting Himself in His glory, such as in the burning bush); the Covenants (i.e., the 
Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Davidic covenants); the Enactment of the Law of Moses[d]; the 
Religious Service (i.e., the temple rituals, sacrificial system, priestly traditions, etc.); the 
Promises— 
5|who are the descendants of the patriarchs, and from whom the Messiah 
came, physically speaking, who is over all, God be blessed forevermore. Let us pause a 
moment for that to sink in.[e]
          
6|It’s not as though the word of God has been ineffectual. The fact of the matter 
is, Israel doesn’t consist solely of everyone who was spawned from the nation of Israel[f], 

7|nor are all of Abraham’s children (i.e., his sons, grandsons, etc.) his seed (i.e., his 
true father-to-son lineal descendants and progeny); rather, “Your seed shall be in and 
through Isaac.” 
8|In other words[g], the children of the flesh (i.e., the biological 
offsprings) are not the ones who’re the children of God[B], rather the children of promise 
are regarded as being the seed. 
9|In fact, this statement from the Old Testament is based 
on promise, “I’ll come at the right time[h], and Sarah will have a son[i].”
          
10|Not just that but Rebekah too, while doing on the marriage bed what 
married couples do, was impregnated[j] from what came out of one man, from Isaac, one of 
our patriarchs. 
11|You see, while they had not been born yet and committed any 
good or bad deed, in order that freedom of choice in God’s purpose would persist— 

12|not as a works-outcome but rather as a calling-outcome, the free choice of the One 
Who calls[C]—she was told that, “the older and therefore superior one shall serve the 
younger,” 
13|as it’s written:

I loved Isaac;
I hated (i.e., despised; had contempt for; loathed) Esau


14|What’s the takeaway[k]? Not that God’s unfair, right?—Don’t even think about 
it.[l] 
15|Furthermore, he tells Moses:

I’ll have mercy on whom I so happen to show mercy to
And have pity on whom I so happen to have pity on


16|So then it’s not based on the person desiring this or that or the one pursuing this 
or that, but rather it’s a product of the mercy of God. 
17|In fact, in regard to 
Pharaoh the Old Testament[m] says:

I brought you to prominence for this:
In order to demonstrate in you My power
And in order to make My reputation[n] known
To everyone throughout all the land 


18|So then, He shows mercy to whom He pleases; He hardens the heart of whom He 
pleases.
          
19|I know what you’re going to say now[o]: how can He blame anyone for 
anything anymore? In this regard, who has arrived at a point where he’s successfully 
resisted His will? 
20|Wow—aren’t you something?[p]—no, on the contrary who do 
you think you are[q], you who responds to an assertion that God has made with a 
contradictory reply? Shall the thing created tell its creator, “Why’d you make me this 
way?” 
21|Doesn’t the potter have the right to make vessels from the same lump of 
clay that are intended for dishonorable use (i.e., dirty water basins or chamber pots) on 
the one hand but for honorable use (i.e., best dinnerware pieces or decorative pots) on 
the other[r]? 
22|What if God, wanting to demonstrate His wrath in a particular 
situation and make His capabilities known near and far in the same, while exercising a 
good deal of patience took vessels of wrath along for a ride[s], preparing them for an 
ends of destruction? 
23|And what if He, in order that the riches of His glory be 
made known, wanted to demonstrate His kindness upon vessels of mercy, ones that have 
been prepared beforehand for an ends of glory, 
24|even us, whom He called, not 
only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles as well? 
25|Also, like in the 
Book of Hosea:

I will call the people who aren’t My people “My people,”
And the unloved woman “beloved.”

26|And it will come to pass that in the place
Where they were told “You are not My people,”
There they’ll be called “sons of the Living God.”


27|Now while representing Israel, Isaiah cried out, 

Even if the descendants of Israel happened to be
As numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,
Only a select few will be spared from calamity[D]


28|Furthermore Isaiah said:

Wrap it up lickety-split[E]—
That’s what the Lord will do upon the earth


29|And just as Isaiah said before the fact:

Had not the Army Commander-in-Chief[t]
Left behind seed (i.e., progeny; heirs) for us,
We would’ve become like Sodom,
And we would’ve duplicated Gomorrah.

          
30|So what’s the takeaway[u]? That the Gentiles—they who aren’t pursuing 
righteousness—cornered and subdued righteousness (a righteousness which came out 
of faith)? 
31|But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness (i.e., a system of rules of 
right conduct), didn’t attain law (i.e., didn’t live up to the standards of those rules)? 

32|Because of what? Because their pursuit of righteousness wasn’t from a standpoint of 
faith but was pursued as though it could be attained from a standpoint of works. They 
crashed into the collision-stone, 
*[a]that I would be granted this request…Lit: I would pray. Quoting Max & Mary, “in Hellenistic Greek, the 
imperfect verb tense takes the place of potential optative”; this is the case here.
*[b]brethren…Lit: brothers
*[c]the Lineal Descent Selection…Lit: the adoption
*[d]the Enactment of the Law of Moses…Lit: the legislation
*[e]Let us pause a moment for that to sink in…Lit: amen. Ref. Rom. 1:25; Rev. 19:4.
*[f]Israel doesn’t consist solely of everyone who was spawned from the nation of Israel…Lit: not all they 
out of Israel, these are Israel
*[g]In other words…Lit: that is
*[h]at the right time…Lit: according to the season
*[i]Sarah will have a son…Lit: a son will be with [or in] Sarah
*[j]while doing on the marriage bed what married couples do, was impregnated …Lit: [she] having bed. 
The bed is a synecdoche for having ongoing sexual relations (ref. Heb. 13:4). That she conceived as a 
result is a synecdoche.
*[k]what’s the takeaway…Lit: what shall we say
*[l]Don’t even think about it…Lit: may it not come into being
*[m]Old Testament…Lit: Scripture
*[n]reputation…Lit: name
*[o]I know what you’re going to say now…Lit: So then will you say to me
*[p]Wow—aren’t you something…Lit: oh man
*[q]who do you think you are…Lit: who are you
*[r]vessels from the same lump of clay that are intended for dishonorable use (i.e., dirty water basins or 
chamber pots) on the one hand but for honorable use (i.e., best dinnerware pieces or decorative pots) on 
the other…Lit: on the one hand it, a vessel, unto honor, but on the other hand it unto dishonor. Same 
wording used in. 2 Tim. 2:20,21.
*[s]took…along for a ride…Lit: brought; carried . Somewhat of a figure of speech.
*[t]Army Commander-in-Chief…Lit: Lord of Sabaoth [Hosts]. Sabaoth is Hebrew for Hosts.
*[u]what’s the takeaway…Lit: what shall we say
*[v]Zion…Ref. note of John 12:14

*[A]the Shekhinah-Glory…Lit: the glory. Episodes in the OT where God’s glory was present: Moses and the 
burning bush; the cloud on Mt. Sinai; Solomon’s dedication of the temple; etc.
*[B]the children of the flesh are not the ones who’re the children of God…Lit: not the children of flesh, these 
[are] children of God. The phrase these are children of God is a parallel construct to the literal rendering 
in v. 6, these are Israel. The use of the word this or these in this way is a figure of speech (also appears in 
John 1:2/this person), one which is also used in English with the near and far demonstrative pronouns. In 
the NT, the use of this or that as a figure of speech, like in this person or those people means that the 
writer is spotlighting a person while presenting him to the reader; is emphasizing the distinction 
between one person and another (this is the case in chapter nine here).
*[C]not as a works-outcome but rather as a calling-outcome, the free choice of the One Who calls…(Ref. 
note of Acts 13:46 also.)This verse and the surrounding passage was a bedrock of Calvin’s teaching on 
predestination, and along with him most who taught and teach predestination. The question is not 
whether God chooses ahead of time or capriciously (or both), but how He so chooses. Although God 
reserves the right to choose irrespective of what man does, on the other hand He has given us promises 
whereby a person can be sure that if he acts on such a promise, God will fulfill his promise. There are 
thousands of promises in the Bible, and these are given for our benefit, to know that God has 
guaranteed something. On the other extreme is 1 Cor. 12:18, where God places each believer in Christ’s 
body capriciously. In the case of Jacob and Esau, where God chose Jacob and rejected Esau, reading into 
the story, God’s choice was not arbitrary, but was based on the heart of Jacob and of Esau. Furthermore, 
Jacob’s and Esau’s hearts were fixated while they were still in Rebekah’s womb—which is unusual. 
While, certainly, God chose Jacob over Esau before they were born and had “committed any good or 
bad deed” (v. 11), God saw their hearts before they were born and decided based on what was in them. 
When says in v. 15 that God will have mercy on whomever He chooses, it implies that no one is in a 
position to come to God and demand something by means of justice (ref. 3:19,20); this excludes God 
from being “unfair” (v. 14). 
*[D]only a select few will be spared from calamity…Lit: a remnant shall be saved. The concept of the 
remnant is understood by studying its usage in the OT.
*[E]wrap it up lickety-split…Also: shutting a piece of business down and wrapping it up quickly…Lit: 
finishing an affair off and cutting it short. [very Lit: for a word finishing and cutting]. The two Gk. words 
for finishing and cutting rhyme; this is likely a paronomasia (pun) of a sort. The use of this figure of 
speech explains the abrupt transition to the sentence which follows.
*[F]problem-causing rock…Lit: a stone of stumbling [Skandalon, (σκάνδαλον/Strong’s 4625)]. The word 
skandalon is used in the LXX to refer to the hostile nations which surrounded Israel and harassed her; its 
meaning is based on this usage. Ref. note of Matt. 18:6.
[G]it/him…It can mean either or both, as the GT is ambiguous. Perhaps when the OT was written, it was 
taken to mean it, as the antecedent it is stone, an inanimate object. But as Paul’s writing in the time of 
fulfillment of this prophecy, it’s known that the rock is a he, namely Christ. So Paul may have been 
intentionally putting this ambiguity to good use.

1|Comrades[a], my heart’s good intentions towards my fellow Israelites and my 
prayer to God when I pray for them are targeted towards their salvation (i.e., their being 
rescued from spiritual, moral, mental, and physical calamity). 
2|Furthermore, I do 
declare that they have a zeal for God, but not a zeal in which they arrive at an 
understanding of what they’re doing[b]. 
3|For while being ignorant of the 
righteousness of God and while seeking to erect their own righteousness, they didn’t 
put themselves in subjection to the righteousness of God. 
4|You see, for all those who 
have faith and believe, Christ puts an end to[c] law (i.e., the method of living by God’s 
list of rules) whose end-goal is righteousness.
          
5|In fact, Moses writes about the righteousness which comes out of law, stating 
that, “Those things which a person has done, he’ll stake his life on them[d].” 
6|But the 
righteousness which comes from the perspective of faith puts things this way: Don’t say 
in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven” (that is, to bring Christ down), or, 

7|“Who will descend into the abyss (i.e., the world of the dead; the place of eternal 
identity-loss)” (that is, to bring Christ up out of the world of the dead)[A]; 
8|Rather, 
what does the Old Testament say? It says:

The spoken-word[B] is near you,
In your mouth and in your heart

…That is, the “spoken-word which is near you” is the word of faith[C] which we preach, 

9|that if you were to confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with your 
heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (i.e., rescued from spiritual, 
moral, mental, and physical calamity). 
10|You see, the word is believed with the 
heart, and the end-result is righteousness; the word is confessed with the mouth, and the 
end-result is salvation (i.e., the state of being saved). 
11|To this point, the Old 
Testament[e] says:

He who trusts and believes in it[f]
Won’t have any regrets


12|In fact, there’s no distinction made between Jews and non-Jewish Westerners[g]; 
for the same Lord is everyone’s Lord, enriching all who call upon him: 

13|“Everyone who ventures to call upon the Lord’s authority and reputation for 
being favorably inclined[h] will be saved.”
          
14|So how could they call upon him whom they haven’t believed in? How 
could they believe in a person they haven’t heard of? Apart from people preaching to 
them, how could they hear about him? 
15|How could these people preach if they 
haven’t been sent out? As it’s written:

Oh, how beautiful are the feet (i.e., the course and direction of the lives)
Of those[D] evangelizing the good things of God


16|No, not everyone obeyed the Good News, the Gospel. You see, Isaiah says, 
“Lord who believed our message?” 
17|Therefore, the faith that I’m talking about 
comes out of hearing a message (i.e., listening intently to a message and letting it sink 
into your heart and not just pass through your head); the hearing I’m talking about comes 
through a spoken-word of Christ[E].
          
18|That aside, I’ll tell you this: It’s not as though they haven’t heard the 
message yet, is it? On the contrary:

The sound of their voice went out to the entire earth
And to the far reaches of the civilized world[i]


19|No, I’ll one-up that and say this: It’s not that Israel hasn’t understood the message, 
is it? Right out of the gate Moses says,

I’ll make you jealous over[j] a people;
I’ll enrage you over a people who are clueless


20|And Isaiah takes it to another level and says:

I was discovered by those not seeking Me;
I became manifest to those not inquiring of Me

*[A]Don’t say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven” (that is, to bring Christ down), or, “Who will 
descend into the abyss (i.e., the world of the dead; the place of eternal identity-loss)” (that is, to bring 
Christ up out of the world of the dead)…This summarizes the two principal heresies of Christ: the first is 
“who will ascend into heaven to bring Christ down.” This is the view that Christ never became flesh and 
blood; that he is God’s son, but he’s always been up in heaven and always will be. Though he’s the son 
of God, he’s inaccessible to us; too high up for us; not able to and never has come down to our level. 
The second is “who will descend into the abyss to bring Christ up out of it.” This view says that Jesus was 
a man, but was subject to the same demise of any other human being. Although he lived an inspiring 
life, he’s dead now like any other person is. Essentially, he’s no use to anyone anymore since he was 
mortal like us, but now he’s dead and can’t help anyone anymore.
*[B]spoken-word…Gk: rhema (ῥῆμα/Strong’s 4487). Rhema is a form of the Gk. word logos (λόγος/Strong’s 
3056); it appears to be derived from an aorist participle from the verb form of logos, which is legō 
(λέγω/Strong’s 3004). The lexicon definition of rhema is “that which is or has been uttered by the living 
voice; the thing spoken” (Thayer’s); “that which is said, word, statement, expression, or statement of 
any kind” (Danker & Bauer). To add to the note of John 1:1, a note which explains the meaning of logos, 
it can be viewed as the comprehensive body of thought on a subject matter the ancient Greeks captured 
in a book (a scroll). Thus, the great philosophers wrote treatises on everything from science to politics. 
These treatises were the logos for a subject, the written word on that subject. On the other hand, a 
rhema is a spoken word on a subject, as indicated by its usage in Heb. 12:20. Since it’s spoken and not 
written, one infers a few things about it. First, it isn’t a comprehensive erudition on a subject. For this 
reason, John called Jesus the Logos and not the Rhema. Second, since it’s spoken, it’s applied to a 
particular situation at a particular point in time; it’s the logos applied in real-time; it’s a specific 
application of the logos. Third, the rhema spoken about in v. 8 the “word of faith” is the word which is 
“in your mouth and in your heart” and is spoken out “of faith.” Rhema is the logos, the written word, 
planted in one’s heart and spoken out of one’s mouth. The promise given in v. 9 is that anyone who 
speaks such a rhema about Jesus being Lord and God raising him from the dead is guaranteed to receive 
the promise, in this passage, to be saved.
*[C]word of faith…This phrase in v. 8 is where the Word of Faith movement gets its name from. The Word 
of Faith movement says that this passage here in Rom. 10 is a general principle of faith—an important 
one—one which applies not only to being saved (v. 9), but to any and all promise in the Bible.
*[D]Oh, how beautiful are the feet (i.e., the course and direction of the lives) of those…Feet in the Bible are 
a metonymy for the direction one’s life is headed in; his decision to follow a certain path; his tendency 
to do so; his consistency in sticking to it.
[E]word of Christ…The Textus Receptus and other manuscripts say word of God, but the manuscript 
support for word of Christ is stronger than for word of God. The Gk. word rhema (ῥῆμα/Strong’s 4487)is 
used for word here and throughout the chapter. By using rhema repeatedly, Paul refers to the same 
concept throughout the chapter. Also, Paul writes the faith at the beginning of v. 17 rather than simply 
faith (no definite article). The use of the definite article before faith means that Paul’s continuing his 
train of thought and referring to the same principle of faith and the word that he started in v. 8.

21|But to Israel it says:

All day long I’ve had My arms stretched out
To a disobedient and contrary folk


&ROM 11
1|So, I’ll say this: God hasn’t rejected His people, has He?—Not a chance.[a] The 
fact of the matter is that I myself am an Israelite, from Abraham’s seed (i.e. lineal 
descent; progeny; great-great-etc. grandson), the tribe of Benjamin— 
2|God hasn’t 
rejected His people, those whom He foreknew (i.e., knew their individual personalities, 
nature, and spiritual acuity before it became apparent). Or don’t you know what the 
Old Testament[b] says about Elijah? As he intercedes with God against Israel:


3|Lord, they killed Your prophets, they tore down Your altars,
And I’m the only survivor, and they’re out to get me[c]


4|What does God’s Divine Answer[d] tell him instead?

I’ve kept at My disposal seven-thousand men,
Those individuals in particular
Who haven’t kowtowed[e] to Baal


5|So in the same way in this day-and-age also, a remnant (i.e., the select few who’ve 
stayed the course) freely chosen by grace has emerged. 
6|Now if the choice is by grace, 
it’s no longer a product of works, since grace of this sort would no longer qualify as 
being grace. 
7|What then? What Israel sought after, that’s what it didn’t obtain; it 
obtained the free choice by grace, but the rest who weren’t part of the remnant were 
hardened on the inside 
8|just as it’s written:

God gave them a deep, intense mindset[f] of stupefaction,
Eyes incapable of sight and ears incapable of hearing,
Continuing up to the present day


9|And in the Old Testament David says:

Let their sustenance, provision, relaxation, and merriment[g]
Turn into a snare and into a net
And into a cause of vexation[h]
And into a tit-for-tat payback meted out to them.

10|Let their vision deteriorate to the point where they can’t see,
And throughout all of this let their back be
Thrown out and mangled up, leaving them hunched over.


11|I’m saying that they haven’t careened off the road to where they’re stuck in a 
ditch[i], have they?—Don’t even think about it.[j] Instead, by their transgressions the 
salvation which is in Jesus in one fell swoop[k] has been made available to the Gentiles in order 
to provoke my fellow countrymen to imitation because of envy[A]. 
12|Now if their 
transgression is a bonanza for the world, and their failure a bonanza for the Gentiles, 
how much more of a bonanza would their saturation in the faith be?
          
13|I’m addressing you Gentiles. Insofar as I have indeed been sent as a 
missionary—an apostle—to the Gentiles—I’m putting my ministry on center stage[l], 

14|if somehow I might provoke my kinsmen to imitation because of envy and 
thereby save (i.e., rescue) some of them. 
15|You see, if their rejection of Jesus be the 
world’s reconciliation, what can their acceptance of Jesus be if not life from the dead? 

16|If the early sample[m] of the harvest is consecrated to God, the bulk of the harvest 
is consecrated as well; if the root’s consecrated, the branches are too.
          
17|Now if some of the branches were chopped off, you—the wild olive 
branch—were grafted into them and became joint-partakers of the Olive Tree’s Root of 
Faith, 
18|no boasting from the wild branches about how you supplanted the natural 
branches. But if you intend to adopt a condescending attitude, keep in mind that you don’t 
support the root, but the root supports you. 
19|So if you’re going to say, “Branches 
were chopped off so that I could be grafted in”… 
20|that’s all well and good: they 
were broken off due to their refusal to believe[n]; you’ve come to stand due to faith. 
Don’t think highly of yourselves, but adopt an attitude of fear: 
21|if God didn’t spare 
the natural branches, I don’t see any way around Him not sparing you either.
          
22|Ah[o], God’s kindness and severity. On the one hand, severity will be 
lavished upon those who’ve wound up in a ditch by their own doing[p], but on the other 
hand God’s kindness will be lavished upon you, if you were to continue doing what 
you’re doing in[q] this kindness; otherwise, you’ll be “chopped off” so to speak too. 

23|And they too—if they were to not continue in their refusal to believe, they’ll be 
grafted in: the fact is, God is able to graft them back in again. 
24|You see, if you 
were chopped off a wild olive tree and grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much 
more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?
          
25|The fact of the matter is that I don’t want you to continue in ignorance, 
comrades[r], over this mystery, so that you wouldn’t be forming within yourselves 
thoughts and ideas which haven’t been carefully considered or well thought-through, 
since, to a large extent a hardness has occurred to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles 
enters in, 
26|and in this way all Israel shall be saved (i.e., rescued from spiritual, 
moral, mental, and physical calamity), just like it’s been recorded in Scripture:

The Deliverer will come out of Zion
(i.e., out of the manifestation of God’s ultimate plan)—
He’ll repel ungodliness from Israel.

27|And this is the Covenant from Me to them,
That I’ll take away their sins[s].


28|Yes, they are enemies of the Good News, the Gospel, on account of you, but are 
beloved according to the Selection on account of the patriarchs of Israel: 
29|the gifts 
that were given by the grace of God, not earned by the recipients, and the calling of God (i.e., 
God’s selection to be one of His people) are irrevocable, you see. 
30|Just as you 
were disobedient to God and unconvinced that you should believe in Him a while ago, you 
have now received mercy on account of their disobedience and unbelief. 
31|In the 
same way, at the present moment these people too are disobedient to and unconvinced 
by your mercy to the effect that they would receive mercy. 
32|For God consigned 
them all[t] to disobedience so that they all would receive mercy.
          
33|Oh, the depth of the riches, the wisdom, and the understanding of God—
as His decisions evade analysis and the path that He’s taken cannot be traced[u]!…


34|In fact, who knew what was on the Lord’s mind?
Or who became His decision-making advisor?

35|Or who’s loaned him anything
That He’ll have to pay back?

1|On account of the mercies of God, I beseech you, comrades[a], to present your 
bodies an alive, holy, and acceptable (“acceptable” as though it complies with something 
analogous to the requirements in the Old Testament for the animals to be sacrificed) sacrifice 
(like a sacrificial animal) to God, performing your religious ritual, one which constitutes 
worship. 
2|And be not conformed to the lifestyle of this age, but be transformed on the 
outside by what’s on the inside by the renewing of the mind instead, resulting in you 
continuously approving as the result of examination what the will of God is, the good 
will of God, the acceptable[A] will of God, and the perfect will of God.
          
3|In addition, through the grace given to me I’m telling every one of you all 
not to let your minds stray and be thinking loftier thoughts, thoughts where you think 
more highly of yourself, than you ought be thinking[b], but be sound-minded (i.e., come 
down to earth, straighten your head out, and get rid of those lofty thoughts) instead, as 
God has allocated an area of responsibility for every person[B]. 
4|You see, just as 
there’re many parts to any given body, but all the parts don’t serve the same purpose, 

5|similarly, we the many parts are one body in Christ, and a member of one another 
from an individual perspective.
          
6|Now having gifts[C] according to the grace (i.e., the giver giving not based on 
the receiver meriting it but based on the giver’s generosity; giving with no expectation 
of receiving anything in return; giving something freely and therefore irrevocably) 
given to us diversely, whether the gift be prophecy (i.e., speaking the utterances of God) 
let the prophesying be done according to the allocation of responsibility[c]; 
7|whether 
being in charge of a particular area of ministry and serving in that area[d], let the same be 
applied to the service; whether teaching, let the same be applied to the teaching; 

8|whether assistance, advocacy, counseling, and encouraging[e], let the same be applied 
to the assistance, etc.; whether giving[f], let the same be applied in singleness (i.e., in 
simplicity: straightforward, without hesitancy, hidden agendas, or internal conflicts); 
whether taking the lead, let the same be applied with pep, diligence, and self-motivation; 
whether being merciful, let the same be applied in cheerfulness.
          
9|Let the love you have be genuine and without hypocrisy.
      Hate the evil that’s in the world, adhere to the good.
          
10|With a close comradeship, engage in close friendships formed out of 
natural affection.
      In the high value with which you esteem others, put each other ahead of yourselves.
          
11|Using pep, diligence, and self-motivation, don’t be lazy.
      In the Spirit be zealous[g].
      Serve in the Lord.
          
12|In good times, rejoice; in bad times, persevere[h].
      Pray constantly—continuously.
          
13|Be intimately familiar with the needs of the saints, your fellow believers.
      Reach out to those who are new or who are different—make this your pastime.[i]

      Bless and don’t curse.
          
15|Rejoice with those who’re rejoicing.
      Weep with those who’re weeping.
          
16|Maintain the same mindset towards each individual: don’t think you’re 
better than anyone else[k] but associate with those who’ve been humbled by 
circumstances or by their station in life (i.e., those on the lowest wrungs of society; those 
who aren’t the brightest and best). Don’t become too big for your britches/too big for 
your boots[l].
          
17|When anyone does something bad to you, don’t do something bad to them in 
return.
      Have respect for what people generally regard as beautiful and what they hold 
in high esteem.
          
18|If at all possible, for your own part, be at peace with everyone.
          
19|Don’t take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of 
God. You see, it’s written:

“Vengeance is for Me to do, I’ll pay them back,” says the Lord


20|Instead of taking revenge:

If your enemy happens to be hungry, give him something to eat.
If he happens to be thirsty, give him some water.

persevere. Note that times of is an interpolation.
*[i]Reach out to those who are new—make this your pastime…Lit: pursue the hospitality
*[j]Have a good word to say about those who persecute others…Lit: bless those persecuting [you]. The 
word you appears in some of the principle manuscripts but does not appear in the others.
*[k]don’t think you’re better than anyone else…Lit: don’t think the high things. This appears to be an idiom. 
Also, the word think in this context (and it’s used three times in v. 16) refers to thoughts and attitudes 
you have towards other people.
*[l]Don’t become too big for your britches/too big for your boots…Lit: Don’t become thinking with 
yourselves. This appears to be an idiom. The word thinking refers to the opinion you have of others (see 
previous note).The phrase with yourselves is also used in Rom. 11:25.
*[m]stew in his own juice…Lit: heap coals of fire on his head. An idiom.

*[A]acceptable…Since the same Gk. word for acceptable is used in here in v. 2 as was used in v. 1, the 
meaning of acceptable as it appears in v. 2 takes on the same meaning as was used in v. 1, where in that 
verse it refers to the requirements specified in the Law of Moses for the sacrificial animal to be offered 
at the temple. The acceptable will of God is therefore one which meets the set of minimum 
requirements.
*[B]God has allocated an area of responsibility for every person…Lit: God as apportioned to each person a 
portion of trust. The Gk. word for faith [pistis, (πίστις/Strong’s 4102)] also means trust. A similar word 
pistos means faithful or trustworthy.
[C]gifts…There’s more than one NT Gk. word rendered gift; the one used in this verse is charisma, which 
is obviously derived from the word charis [grace,(χάρις/Strong’s 5485)]; Paul uses both here, 
exemplifying and reinforcing the relationship between the two. To quote Max & Mary, a charisma is “a 
gift of God’s grace, for the benefit of the community.” A charisma is a gift that’s given by the grace of 
the giver (also, ref. note of Acts 8:20). It’s given irrevocably. The recipient did not and cannot earn it. The 
Greek word dōron (δῶρον/Strong’s 1435), which in general means gift as we know the word in English, 
is also used when describing the gift offerings given to God; the implication is that the gift is given based 
on the worthiness of the recipient; the obligation to give.

2|so that any given person who opposes the authority that’s in place 
has taken a stand against the way that God decides to organize and arrange things; the

arrested, prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated by the criminal justice system) for 
doing so.

5|Putting it all together, you’ve got to submit to the authorities, not just because 
of the wrath they could potentially inflict but also because you should be keeping a clean 
conscience[b]. 
6|In fact, this is also a reason why you pay taxes: they’re ministers (i.e., 
officers, constables, judges, etc.) of God employed full-time at this, and their salary is paid 
out of tax revenue. 
7|Pay all the taxes that you’re on the hook to pay: tax to the taxman, 
tolls at the tollgate, customs at the customhouse, reverence—fear even—to the one who 
instills fear, honor to the one who should be honored.
          
8|Don’t owe anyone anything[c] except to love one another: he who loves 
another person has fulfilled law (i.e., has satisfied the mandates of any list of godly 
rules). 
9|To this end, the commandments, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” “Thou 
shalt not murder,” “Thou shalt not steal,” “Thou shalt not covet,” and if there’s any 
other commandment I should’ve included, it’s summed up by one statement, “Thou shalt 
love thy neighbor as thyself.” 
10|The love that you show to the typical neighbor 
doesn’t do anything bad; so then, love is a fulfillment of law.
          
11|I’ll add this to what I’ve said. You know what time it is, that it’s time for us 
to wake up, for now our salvation is closer than when we first became believers. 

12|The night wanes, daylight approaches, so put away the deeds of darkness; put 
on the armor of the light. 
13|Like the way people carry themselves during the day, go 
about behaving appropriately and properly, not with loud partying, drunkenness, or 
sleeping around and unrestrained indulgence in immoral, physical pleasures, nor strife, 
discord, contention and the ensuing passions. 
*[a]all people from all walks of life…Lit: every soul. In the NT, soul is used from time to time as a 
synecdoche for person, emphasizing what’s in the mind of that person, the uniqueness and individuality 
of him.
*[b]because you should be keeping a clean conscience…Lit: on account of conscience
*[c]anyone anything…Similar to anyone anything, the GT here also has an alliteration/assonance, mādeni 
māden (Μηδενὶ μηδὲν).

*[A]overarching authorities…The overarching authorities are a synecdoche for the entire authority 
structure from the top on down.
[B]the wherewithal to forcibly and violently impose their will upon you—and won’t hesitate to use it…Lit: 
don’t bear the sword in vain. The sword is a metonymy for the arms that the law enforcement agencies 
use, and also includes their coordinated efforts when using them. This is not only the use of violence to 
arrest criminals but to imprison them as well. Furthermore, that the violence is deadly violence: this 
verse says that law enforcement agents and the criminal justice system have the right, the ability, and 
the responsibility to inflict deadly violence up to the point of killing a criminal, not only while arresting 
him but as the sentence for the crime committed.

1|Accept the person who’s struggling in the Faith the way he is without 
resolving the disagreements over what he should or shouldn’t believe. 
2|On the one hand 
a given person who believes that he’s permitted to eat any kind of food eats every kind of 
food, but on the other hand a given person who’s struggling[a] with his faith is a 
vegetarian. 
3|Don’t let the one who believes he’s permitted to eat anything despise the 
one who doesn’t, and don’t let the one who won’t eat everything judge the one who 
does; you see, God has accepted this person.
          
4|Who do you think you are, you who judges another man’s butler?—The butler 
will stand or fall (i.e., get the nod of approval to continue doing what he’s doing or be 
reprimanded and forced to amend his behavior) by his own boss. And stand he will, for 
the boss—the Lord—is able to pick him up off the ground and stand him to his feet[b].
          
5|In fact, one person decides that one day stands out above the other days as 
being a special holy day; another person decides that all days are the same and so none 
stands out above the others—let each person work it all out in his own mind. 
6|The one 
who thinks about what days should be considered holy thinks the day he has in mind should 
be dedicated to the Lord; the one who’ll eat anything eats to the Lord; you see while eating 
these items he’s giving thanksgiving to God; and the one who won’t eat everything 
abstains from eating certain foods to the Lord, and while not eating these items he’s 
thanking God. 
          
7|The fact of the matter is that not a one of us lives for himself, and not a one of 
us dies for himself. 
8|If we so happen to live, we live in the Lord; and if we so happen 
to die, we die in the Lord. And so, if we so happen to live and so happen to die, we are 
of the Lord (i.e., we are a part of, are derived from, the Lord). 
9|You see, Christ died 
and came back to life again[c] to arrive at this point: in order to assume lordship over 
both the dead and the living.
          
10|Who do you think you are, you who judges your fellow comrade[d]? Or I 
can also say, who do you think you are to despise your comrade? You see, we’ll all have 
to stand in the courtroom before God the judge, 
11|seeing that it’s written:

“As surely as I live,” says the Lord, “I swear
That everyone willingly or not
Will be on their knees before Me paying homage,
And that every tongue will confess out loud
In homage to God.”


12|So then each of you will deliver a written report[e] to God concerning himself 
while he stands before Him in judgment, and God will go over that report with him.
          
13|So no longer judge one another, but become all the more determined to 
not do something in particular that your fellow comrade believes is sinful or that causes 
your fellow comrade to regress into sin[f]— 
14|I know for a fact and have reached 
the point where I’m persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing I’ve written about here is 
forbidden to partake of, participant in, or consume[A] in and of itself, except by someone 
who reckons that it’s forbidden—to that person, it’s forbidden. 
15|In fact, if your 
comrade is being hurt by you because of food, you’re no longer walking in love. Don’t 
destroy he whom Christ died for with your food convictions.
          
16|So don’t let your good behavior be spoken of disparagingly. 
17|The 
kingdom of God (i.e., God’s involvement with mankind) does not chiefly concern itself 
with food and drink[g] you see, but rather with righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy 
Spirit. 
18|In fact, the one who’s serving—slaving away—in Christ in doing this is 
well-pleasing to God and spoken well of by the people around him[h]. 
19|So then 
pursue those things pertaining to peace and to each other’s edification. 
20|Don’t 
dismantle the work of God because of an issue over food. Yes, all foods can be 
consumed[i], but’s it’s wrong for the person who sees a particular food as an item of 
temptation and as something that is sinful to eat[j]. 
21|The practice of not eating 
meat, drinking wine, or indulging in something which your fellow comrade believes to 
be sinful is laudable. 
22|Keep your personal beliefs between you and God. Blessed 
is he who’s not having to decide for himself one way or the other in the moment what 
he’s OK with. 
*[a]struggling…Lit: weak
*[b]able to pick him up off the ground and stand him to his feet…Lit: to stand. The interpolation is 
suggested by the aorist tense of the infinitive stand.
*[c]came back to life again…Lit: lived
*[d]fellow comrade…Lit: brother
*[e]deliver a written report…Lit: give a word. The interpolation written is implied by the use of the Gk. 
word logos (λόγος/Strong’s 3056)instead of rhema (ῥῆμα/Strong’s 4487).
*[f]something in particular that your comrade believes is sinful or that causes your comrade to regress into 
sin…Lit: place an occasion for stumbling to the brother or a stumbling block. Ref. note of Matt. 18:6.
*[g]does not chiefly concern itself with food and drink…Lit: is not food and drink. The Gk. words for food 
and drink (brōsis and posis, (βρῶσις/Strong’s 1035), (πόσις/Strong’s 4213)) rhyme, making them a figure 
of speech (alliteration/assonance).
*[h]spoken well of by the people around him…Lit: approved by men
*[i]can be consumed…Lit: are clean. This is the opposite of unclean used in v. 14.
*[j]the person who sees a particular food as a source of temptation and something that is sinful to eat…Lit: 
the man who eats on account of an occasion for stumbling. Occasion for stumbling is the same word 
used in v. 13; ref. note there, and ultimately Matt. 18:6. Also, the interpolations a particular food and 
that food are simple inferences, as without them, Paul would be permitting everything.

[A]nothing I’ve written about here is forbidden to partake of, participant in, or consume…Lit: nothing [is] 
unclean. The word unclean is the Gk. word koinos (κοινός/Strong’s 2839), which, incidentally, is also the 
root from which we get the word fellowship. Ref. Acts 10:14 with regard to koinos.

Romans

23|But he who’s weighing point and counterpoint deciding if he’d 
chance eating some food has already reached the point where he’s condemned (i.e., 
objectively guilty of wrong-doing), since that’s not a product of faith. Anything which is 
not a product of faith is a sin.


&ROM 15
1|We who are capable ought to bear the struggles[a] of those who are incapable 
and not just please ourselves (i.e., not just make ourselves happy). 
2|Let each of us 
please the neighbor at hand for his betterment. 
3|You see, Christ didn’t go around 
pleasing himself either, but led a life according to this verse instead:

The reproaches of those who reproach You fell upon me


4|To this point, all the many things which were written in the Old Testament were put 
there ahead of time for our instruction, so that we would have hope through the 
endurance (i.e., never-failing consistency and persistency in spite of all things to the 
contrary—in this case, the consistency and persistency of the Old Testament’s themes) 
and through the advice, encouragement, and guidance of the Scriptures. 
5|May the 
God of endurance and of advice, encouragement, and guidance grant that you think 
along the same lines while among one another in a way which is consistent with Christ 
Jesus, 
6|so that speaking the same thing in unison[b] you would glorify the God and 
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
          
7|Therefore take each other into your circles[c], just as, to God’s glory, Christ 
also took us in. 
8|In fact, I’m saying that Christ has already become a minister of 
circumcision (i.e., a minister to those following the Law of Moses) on behalf of the truth 
of God arriving at a place where he proved that the promises of the patriarchs are 
reliable, 
9|but became a servant to the Gentiles on behalf of mercies which glorified 
God, as it’s written:

On account of this, while among Gentiles
I will confess praises to You out loud,
And I’ll sing as one authorized by You to do so[d]


10|And another verse says:

Rejoice, Gentiles, with His folk-people


11|And another:

All you Gentiles praise the Lord,
And have all the folk-people praise Him


12|And another verse from Isaiah says:

There’ll be a root planted from out of David’s father Jesse,
And the offshoot produced from it will be ruling Gentiles.
The Gentiles will set their hope upon it.

          
13|Would that the God of hope fill you with every kind of joy and peace 
imaginable[e] in the Faith to the point of you overflowing in the hope—in the power—of 
the Holy Spirit.
          
14|Concerning you, I’ve been convinced, my dear fellow comrades[f]—even I 
personally have been—that you—yes, you—are full of goodness, having reached a point 
where you’re filled with knowledge of all sorts and are able to admonish one another 
too. 
15|But occasionally I didn’t hold back any punches when I wrote to you, as I 
would remind you through the God-given grace that was given to me 
16|for me to 
be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, treating my ministry of the good news, the 
Gospel, of God as a holy, priestly duty, in order that the sacrificial offering so to speak of 
the Gentiles would become something acceptable, being made holy by the Holy Spirit.
          
17|I have something I’m excited to tell you about[g], something that has to do 
with the things of[h] God in Christ Jesus. 
18|You see, I dare not talk about 
something which Christ didn’t accomplish through me towards the goal of the Gentile’s 
obedience in word and deed, 
19|accomplished by the supernatural power of the 
miraculous[i], that is by the supernatural power of the Spirit of God, so much so that the 
fulfillment of the spreading of the good news of Christ took me from Jerusalem and its 
surrounding area all the way to Illyricum, 
20|but took me in such a way as to travel 
from Jerusalem to Illyricum with the aspiration of evangelizing in places where nobody 
knows for certain what Christ is all about[j], in order that I not build a building upon 
someone else’s foundation, 
21|but instead that the evangelization would be according 
to what was written in the Old Testament,

The announcement about Him will be
To those who haven’t seen Him,
And they who haven’t heard will understand

          
22|For reasons which are obvious, there’ve been so many obstacles in 
getting to go and visit you, 
23|but as things stand now I no longer have any 
options left[k] in these regions and have been having a desire for a good many years now 
to go visit you, 
24|as I might walk to Spain. Specifically, while walking through 
that part of the empire, I hope to see you up close and have you send me on my way from 
there refreshed, resupplied, and ready for the journey, if I could first of all ask you to take care 
of some of my provisions. 
          
25|But I’m going to Jerusalem now in my serving the saints, our fellow-
believers. 
26|The fact of the matter is that Macedonia and Achaia have been 
enthusiastic about making a tangible contribution to the saints in Jerusalem who are 
poor. 
27|They have been enthusiastic, you see, and are indebted to them: for if the 
believers in Jerusalem made tangible contributions to the Gentiles by means of their Holy 
Spirit-generated gifts, ministries, and manifestations of the Holy Spirit[l], the Gentiles too 
ought to serve them in the form of offerings made by means of their own physical 
abilities. 
28|So now that I’m finished with this offering, signed, sealed, and 
delivered,[m] I’ll depart and cross through your area on my way to Spain. 
29|I know 
for a fact that I’m headed your way, going in the fullness of the blessings of Christ.
          
30|I beseech you, comrades, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the 
love of the Spirit, for you to come together and help me out in your prayers to God for 
me, 
31|so that I’d be protected from and delivered out of the disobedience and 
incredulity pervasive among the Judeans, and that my ministry inside of Jerusalem 
would be accepted by the saints there, 
32|so that I could head your way with joy 
through the will of God to take some time off and relax when you and I are together.

[A]Verse 24 omitted from the best manuscripts


1 Corinthians
       The inhabitants of the Greek city of Corinth were better educated and more affluent than most 
of Paul’s other churches, and the contents of his letters to the Corinthians show a church which is a 
mixture of polar extremes, of extremes in spirituality and carnality; extremes in maturity and 
immaturity; extremes in fervency and apathy. The list goes on. But perhaps more than any other NT 
church, the church at Corinth was most like the church in the modern West, and for this reason when 
one reads the epistle, it’s as though Paul had us in mind specifically when he wrote it.
       Paul’s many talents are on display in this letter. He’s not just a lofty theologian, but he can 
handle difficult people, doing so with a mixture of encouragement, rebuke, and reasoning. He appeals to 
their best side, he chastises them when their bad side dominates. But he never forgets to remind them 
that they’re specially chosen people.
       The rich variety of content in this letter, and the great chapter on love, the chapters on the gifts 
of the Spirits, the chapter on death and resurrection are simply the highlights, reflects the breadth of the 
Corinthians’ spirituality. If we today are Corinth, then by proxy we are the recipients of a rich epistle, 
and this should give us hope.

2|To God’s church which exists in Corinth, those set apart by Christ Jesus from

4|When it comes to you, I’m always thanking my God for[b] the grace He’s 
given you in Christ Jesus, 
5|because in him you’ve been enriched in all things, in 
every concept imaginable[c] and in all sorts of knowledge and understanding, 
6|just as 
the testimony of Christ (i.e., the official statement about Christ) has been both made 
firm and has been confirmed in you, 
7|so that you’re not lacking in any Holy Spirit-
generated gift, ministry, or manifestation of the Holy Spirit[d], eagerly awaiting the 
revelation of Christ Jesus our Lord, 
8|who will also establish us until the end of time 
so that we’re blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

through whom we’ve been called into the fellowship of His son Jesus Christ our Lord.
          
10|I appeal to you, comrades, through the name (i.e., the authority) of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, pleading to you that you would always be on the same page[e] and that 
there not be divisions among you, but that you’d be fitted and mended together with 
the same mind and with the same knowledge and understanding. 
11|In this regard 
and concerning you, it’s been made clear to me by Chloe’s family and her servants, my 
dear comrades, that there’s strife going on between you.

exclusively” or “I’m Peter’s[A] devotee exclusively”, or “I’m Christ’s devotee exclusively.” 

13|Has Christ been divided up into pieces? Paul wasn’t crucified on your behalf,

authority to be a member of Paul’s camp?

you except Crispus and Gaius, 
15|lest anyone say that they were baptized on my 
sole authority to be a member of my camp. 
16|Now I did baptize Stephanas’s 
family and servants, but as far as the rest of you, I’m not absolutely sure[B] if I baptized 
anyone else. 
17|You see, Christ didn’t send me to go about baptizing in order to 
build a camp of my own followers but to go about evangelizing instead[C], not in wisdom 
which comes out of a message, so that the cross of Christ wouldn’t be rendered 
ineffectual.
          
18|The message of the cross, you see, is stupidity to those who are lost and 
dying on the one hand, but to those who are being saved (i.e., being rescued from 
spiritual, moral, and physical calamity), it’s the power of God. 
19|For it’s written in 
the Old Testament:

I’ll destroy the wisdom of the wise,
And I’ll annul the understanding of those who understand


20|Where’s the wise man? Where’s the scholar? Where’s this generation’s premier 
debater? Hasn’t God turned this world’s wisdom into stupidity?
          
21|You see, by the wisdom of God, since the world through its wisdom 
didn’t come to recognize, discern, understand, or know God, God was more than happy 
through the stupidity of what was preached to save those who made the decision to 
believe. 
22|Forasmuch as Jews chase after stupendous miracles[h] and Westerners[i] 
chase after wisdom, 
23|we, on the other hand, preach a crucified-Christ; for Jews 
it’s the root-cause of the failure caused by disobedience[j] on the one end of the stick, on 
the other end of the stick, for Westerners it’s stupidity, 
24|but to them who are “the 
Called” (i.e., those whom God has summoned to be His people and who have heeded 
the summons), Jews and Westerners alike, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom, 

25|since the “stupidity” of God is wiser than the wisdom to be found in mankind, and 
the “weakness” of God is stronger than the strength to be found in mankind.
          
26|To this point, consider your group “the Called”: if one looks at their 
backgrounds only[k], not very many of them are wise, not many powerful, not many 
from high-society families or nobility. 
27|No, God’s chosen the stupid things of the 
world to put to shame the wise things, and the weak things of the world to put to shame 
the strong, 
28|and God’s chosen the lowly born and those things which are 
contemptuous—He’s chosen the things that don’t exist to abolish what does, 
29|so 
that any and every human endeavor or accomplishment apart from God can’t be 
presented proudly before Him in the statement, “See—look what I did!”[l] 
30|But 
what’s come out of Him is that you’re melded[m] with Christ Jesus, who became to us 
wisdom from God, righteousness, and likewise holiness and redemption (i.e., the 
recovery of what you once had), 
*[a]comrade…Lit: brother
*[b]for…Lit: at
*[c]every concept imaginable…Or: every word of prophecy imaginable…Lit: all word. The meaning is 
ambiguous and must therefore be decided by context (v. 17, for one). For the choice of concept, ref. 
note of John 1:1.
*[d]Holy Spirit-generated gift, ministry, or manifestation of the Holy Spirit…Lit: spiritual, where it refers to 
the Holy Spirit and not a human or spirit in the sense of attitude. Ref. 1 Cor. 12:1.
*[e]be on the same page…Lit: say the same thing
*[f]on Paul’s sole authority to be a member of Paul’s camp…Lit: into the name of Paul
*[g]thank God…Lit: I thank God that
*[h]stupendous miracles…Lit: signs
*[i]Westerners…Lit: Greeks
*[j]the root-cause of the failure caused by disobedience…Lit: a stumbling block [skandalon, 
(σκάνδαλον/Strong’s 4625)]. Ref. note of Matt. 18:6.
*[k]if one looks at their backgrounds only…Lit: according to [the] flesh. This conclusion is drawn after a 
study of all the usages in the NT of the words flesh and body.
*[l]any and every human endeavor or accomplishment apart from God can’t be presented proudly before 
Him in the statement, “See—look what I did!”…Lit: all flesh won’t boast before God
*[m]melded…Lit: in

*[A]Peter’s…Lit: Cephas’s. Cephas is the Aramaic word for Rock; the Gk. translation of Cephas is Peter. John 
makes a point of quoting Jesus when he gave Peter his new name (John 1:42). Paul’s preference of the 
Aramaic name Cephas over the Gk. name Peter shows his respect for Peter, a respect rooted in Jesus 
having named him, which is determining who he is and what he’s about.
*[B]absolutely sure…Lit: know. The Gk. word for know used here means knowing something to be a fact by 
observing that it’s so; therefore, Paul’s talking about knowing something for certain. He apparently can’t 
recall for certain who he baptized and who he didn’t. One can infer that he baptized a lot of people.
[C]Christ didn’t send me to go about baptizing in order to build a camp of my own followers but to go 
about evangelizing instead…Lit: Christ didn’t send me to go about baptizing but to go about evangelizing 
instead. An example of the necessity of adding select interpolations; in this case the phrase in order to 
build a camp of my own followers is not in the GT. One surmises from the context that Paul assumed 
that the reader would supply these words. Not adding this phrase makes Paul’s statement oxymoronic 
at face value. Evangelization, when successful, results in people receiving Christ, and those who receive 
Christ should be baptized. Therefore, successful evangelization results in baptism; you cannot have the 
one without the other. Since Paul was sent as an apostle to evangelize the Gospel, he must’ve been sent 
to baptize (either himself personally or someone working with him) them as well.

&COR1 2
1|When I went and visited you, comrades[a], I didn’t go there and use heady, 
intellectual language and sublime speech while telling you about the mystery of God. 

2|You see, I decided that when among you I’d appear as though I knew no other facts 
whatsoever except things about Jesus Christ and the fact that this fellow was crucified. 
3|I 
appeared to you as one lacking vigor and strength and as downright fearful, and was 
frequently trembling[A], 
4|and my message and my preaching weren’t in words that 
were wise and persuasive but were accompanied by a powerful demonstration of the 
Spirit that’s difficult to describe if you’ve never experienced it[b], 
5|so that your faith 
wouldn’t be a faith grounded in human wisdom but would be in the power of God 
instead.
          
6|Now we speak words of wisdom among those who are mature, a wisdom, 
however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age (i.e., the demon spirits which have 
controlling influence over this world), rulers who are being rendered ineffective and 
brought to nothing— 
7|instead we speak words of God’s wisdom in a mystery, a 
wisdom which has been hidden up to this point, a wisdom which God knew beforehand 
in eternity past and intended for our glory, 
8|a wisdom which none of the rulers of 
this age knew, understood, or recognized, for if they had, they wouldn’t have crucified 
the Lord of Glory. 
9|No, the wisdom isn’t like that, it’s like it’s written instead:

That which eye hasn’t seen and ear hasn’t heard
And hasn’t arisen and come to rest upon any human heart—
That which God prepared for those who love Him


10|God revealed it to us through the Spirit: for the Spirit thoroughly searches and 
investigates everything, even the deep things of God. 
11|For what person knows 
firsthand the intimate details and intentions[c] of a given person except for that person’s 
spirit that’s in him? In the same way, no one has known, understood, or recognized the 
intimate details and intentions of God except the Spirit of God.
          
12|Now we have not received the spirit of the world but rather the Spirit 
who proceeds out of God, so that we would know firsthand what God has given to us as 
an expression of His grace— 
13|and what was given to us is also that which we 
speak, not speaking in human teachings consisting of words of wisdom but rather in 
teachings of the Spirit consisting of the fitting together nicely of Holy Spirit-related 
content with other Holy Spirit-related content[B]. 
14|A person who’s dominated by 
his mind, intellect, or emotions instead of by his spirit[C] won’t receive the things of the 
Spirit of God; in fact, to him such things are stupid, and he cannot know, understand, or 
recognize them because such things are spiritually examined and decided as a result. 

15|But the spiritual person examines and decides all things, but he himself isn’t 
examined and his life decided by anyone.


*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]with a powerful demonstration of the Spirit that’s difficult to describe if you’ve never experienced 
it…Lit: with [or in] Spirit and power. A hendiadys. Ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[c]intimate details and intentions…Lit: those things. As “those things” is vague, it means a number of 
different things.

*[A]lacking vigor and strength and downright fearful, and was frequently trembling…Lit: in weakness and 
in fear and in much trembling. Judging based on the context, Paul was exhibiting weakness and fear 
when speaking to the Corinthians—not when preaching publicly. The reason he was in weakness and 
fear was out of reverence for the message of Christ crucified accompanied by a strong presence of the 
Holy Spirit, which presence was manifesting itself (“demonstration of the Spirit”) in the gifts and 
miracles (the “power of God”) listed in the twelfth chapter. Paul made himself smaller so as to not 
quench the Holy Spirit (1 Thess. 5:19), so as to give the Holy Spirit greater license to manifest his power. 
As we know from the NT, Paul was not naturally like this; on the contrary, he was the opposite. But the 
Corinthians put such a high premium on speakers with great oratory skills, those who speak persuasively 
and compellingly and who have great charisma and flamboyant personalities, that they viewed Paul with 
disdain.
*[B]of the Spirit consisting of the fitting together nicely of Holy Spirit-related content with other Holy Spirit-
related content…Lit: of Spirit, spirituals to spirituals combining…Literal Gk: pneumatos pneumatikois 
pneumatika sunkrinontes [πνεύματος, πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συγκρίνοντες, (πνεύματος/Strong’s 
4151), (πνευματικοῖς/Strong’s 4152), (πνευματικὰ/Strong’s 4152), (συγκρίνοντες/Strong’s 4793)]. Note 
that the word spiritual refers to the Holy Spirit. The successive words pneumatos pneumatikois 
pneumatika comprise an alliteration, rhyme, assonance, or pun of a sort, and it’s possible that Paul 
personally coined it. The word sunkrinontes means combining; putting together so that they fit together 
well; drawing a conclusion by comparing. Now, there is ambiguity as to whether pneumatos and 
pneumatikois, which are different forms of the same word spirituals, means spiritual things or people 
who are spiritual. The ambiguity permits the following renderings to be defensible: combining spiritual 
things with spiritual things; combining spiritual things with spiritual people; combining spiritual people 
with spiritual people; explaining spiritual things in spiritual terms; interpreting spiritual things in spiritual 
terms; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual people. Such cases of ambiguity are resolved by the 
context and by how the words or phrases in question are used elsewhere, particularly if by the same 
author.
[C]A person who’s dominated by his mind, intellect, or emotions instead of by his spirit…Lit: a soulish-man. 
The word soulish is derivative of the word soul [psuchā, (ψυχή/Strong’s 5590)], where we get the word 
psyche. It refers to the mind, intellect, and emotions. The psyche and the spirit are two distinct and 
different parts of a person (ref. 1 Thess. 5:23; Heb. 4:12). Translations usually render soulish as natural, 
referring to a person who goes about life looking and acting as though the spiritual world doesn’t exist, 
as though there’s no existence after death, etc. Also, ref. note of 1 Thess. 2:8.

We, however, have a mind which is of Christ.


&COR1 3
1|But I, comrades[a], wasn’t able to speak to you like I would to people attuned 
to and dominated by spiritual things but rather like I would to people attuned to and 
dominated by fleshly things (i.e., things that have to do with our lives in the natural, 
even touching our carnal appetites), same as I would to those who are babies in Christ. 

2|I fed you milk, not solid food, as you were not yet able to digest solid food, having not 
been weaned off milk—but even now you still can’t handle solid food; 
3|You’re still 
fleshly, you see: where there’s jealousy and strife still found among you, are you not 
fleshly, and do you not leads lives dictated by the undesirable human tendencies[b]?
          
4|For example, when one of you says, “I’m Paul’s devotee exclusively,” and 
another of you says, “I’m Apollos’s devotee exclusively,” are you not being dominated by 
your undesirable human tendencies[c]? 
5|So who is Apollos? Who is Paul—they’re 
ministers, and you came to believe in Christ through their ministries, and all the steps 
involved and the ministries that were a part of leading you to Christ happened to each person 
as the Lord granted that it happen. 
6|I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but it was 
God who made it grow, 
7|so that neither the one doing the planting nor the one doing 
the watering is the most important part of the process, but God who makes things grow is 
the most important. 
8|The one who does the planting and the one who does the 
watering are on the same team[d], and each will receive an individual-specific wage 
according to his own individual labor[e].
          
9|We’re God’s coworkers, you see, laboring together in God’s field, whereas 
you’re the building-project which God’s constructing, 
10|being constructed 
according to the grace of God which was given to me as a judicious chief architect and 
principal contractor. Accordingly, I laid the foundation, and another subcontractor came 
after me and built the structure on top of the foundation, but let each subcontractor look over 
what[f] he built, to ensure that it was done correctly. 
11|The fact of the matter is that no 
one can lay any other foundation other than the one which has been laid, which 
foundation is Jesus Christ. 
12|Now if some subcontractor builds upon the 
foundation by putting in place gold, silver, gemstones (i.e., the subcontractor did a high-
quality job), wood, hay, or straw (i.e., the subcontractor did a low-quality job) structures 
upon that foundation, 
13|the quality of the work that that particular[g] subcontractor did 
will become apparent to everyone, since some cataclysmic event will eventually occur 
that is enormously stressful[h] to the structure, making its true strengths and deficiencies 
abundantly clear to everyone, since these true strengths and weaknesses are revealed by 
fire (i.e., intense stress), and the fire will determine what kind of job was done by 
putting it through the wringer. 
14|If any of the built-up construction remains, the 
subcontractor will get paid; 
15|if any of the built-up construction is burned up, he’ll 
lose money on the project, but he’ll be spared of personal ruin, but he’ll lose his entire 
investment through the ordeal[i].
          
16|Don’t you know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God 
has taken up residence in you? 
17|If someone trashes, ruins, or destroys the temple 
of God, God will trash that guy. The temple of God—the very thing that you are—is 
holy, you see.
          
18|Let no one fool himself utterly in this regard: if any of you considers 
himself to be wise in this age, let him become stupid, so that he would become wise; 

19|for the wisdom of this world is stupidity to[j] God. In fact, it’s written in the Old 
Testament:

He’s catching the wise in their subtle trickery


20|And another verse says,

The Lord understands the arguments of the wise—
He knows that they’re futile


21|So then, let no one be charged up and beam with pride over[k] people that they’re 
devotees of. The fact of the matter is, all of you— 
22|whether we’re referring to Paul, 
Apollos, or Peter[l]—or whether we’re talking about life, death, the past, or the future— 

*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]lead lives dictated by the undesirable human tendencies…Lit: walk about according to men
*[c]are you not being dominated by your undesirable human tendencies…Lit: are you not men
*[d]on the same team…Lit: one
*[e]labor…Also: toil. This word is commonly used in the context of hard labor in a wheat field, etc. and is 
part of the metaphor for planting and watering.
*[f]what…Lit: how
*[g]that particular…Lit: each. Paul apparently didn’t word this very well.
*[h]some cataclysmic event will eventually occur which is enormously stressful…Lit: the day. Assume 
interpolation “of testing,” to make this “the day of testing.” The day is an idiom used throughout the NT, 
similar to the hour and the season.
*[i]he’ll be spared of personal ruin, but he’ll lose his entire investment through the ordeal…Lit: he 
personally will be saved, but in such a way as through fire. Through fire is apparently an idiom; the 
precise meaning is not entirely certain.
*[j]to…Lit: with
*[k]be charged up and beam with pride over…Lit: boast
*[l]Peter…Lit: Cephas. Ref. note of 1 Cor. 1:12.

&COR1 4
1|Let a person frame his perception of us this way: that we’re attendants of 
Christ and stewards of the mystery of God. 
2|In regard to stewardship, it’s a minimum 
requirement that a person who’s a steward be found faithful. 
3|But it’s not a big deal 
for me to be examined and then judged by you or by any human tribunal for that matter, 
nor do I judge myself in self-examination. 
4|In fact, I’m not self-conscious about 
anything I might’ve done wrong, but—no—I haven’t been exonerated of all wrong-doing 
in this stewardship of mine, but the Lord is the one who examines and judges me, 
5|so 
that you won’t judge me before the timeframe set aside for judgment, that is until the Lord 
happens to come, who in the course of judging will also will illuminate the hidden things 
of darkness and will put the plans, strategies, intentions, and collaborations of the 
hearts out in the open, and at that time the praise from God to each person for what he 
did right will appear.
          
6|But because of you, comrades[a], I made the change and applied these things 
to Apollos and me, so that through our example you would learn the meaning of “Don’t 
be so high-and-mighty that the stuff that’s written in the Bible somehow doesn’t apply to 
you[b],” so that your egos don’t become overly-inflated, with one person thinking himself 
to be superior in understanding something to the one who explained that something to him in 
the first place, both opposed to someone who has a different opinion[A]. 
7|Furthermore, 
who determines what all the different points of view are among you and sorts you into 
categories based on viewpoint?
      What do you have that you didn’t go out and get[c]? And if you got the things you 
decided to get, why do you carry on[d] like you never got them? 
8|You’ve already gotten 
plenty enough—you’re already rich—you live like kings[e] when you’re apart from us—it 
sure would be great if you actually became kings, so that we could live like kings 
together with you. 
9|You see, I’m thinking that God made an exhibit out of us—the 
apostles, the lowliest[B] of people—putting us on display, making us appear to everyone 
as though we’re men who’re condemned to death, since we became a spectacle to the 
world, to angels, and to all of mankind. 
10|We are idiots on account of Christ, but 
you are logical and sensible in Christ; we are weak, you are strong; we are glorious, you 
are dishonored. 
11|Up until this very moment in time, we went hungry and thirsty, 
had no clothes to wear, were beaten, were homeless, 
12|and toiled doing hard 
manual labor. While being abused, we bless; while being persecuted, we endure; 

13|while being slandered, we speak softly[f]. Up until now, we’ve been treated like 
we’re the scum of the world; like we’re everyone’s garbage.
          
14|I’m not writing these things to shame you or to put you on a guilt trip, 
rather I’m writing to you as though you’re my children, ones who are dear to me, and 
I’m admonishing, warning, and instructing you as such. 
15|You see, even if you 
had a million tutors in Christ, you still wouldn’t have many fathers (i.e., those who 
were instrumental in your conversion) in Christ[g], seeing that I begot you in Christ Jesus 
through the Gospel. 
16|So I’m pleading with you: get to where you imitate me[h]. 

17|Because of this desire on my part, I sent you Timothy, who is my dear child in 
Christ and who’s faithful in the Lord, who’ll remind you to imitate the way I do things in 
Christ Jesus, just like I teach everyone in churches everywhere.
          
18|As I’m not heading in your direction to visit you at the moment, some of 
you have acquired inflated egos. 
19|But if it was the Lord’s will, I’d leave 
immediately and travel as quickly as possible to visit you[i], and I’ll recognize and 
discern not the message[j] of those who’ve reached the point where their egos are 
inflated but rather their power; 
20|for the kingdom of God (i.e., God’s interaction 
with mankind) is not in a message but in power. 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]Don’t be so high-and-mighty that the stuff that’s written in the Bible somehow doesn’t apply to 
you…Lit: don’t [be] above that which has been written
*[c]go out and get…Also: take
*[d]carry on…Lit: boast
*[e]live like kings…Lit: reigned; gained a kingdom
*[f]speak softly…Also: exhort; encourage; help
*[g]even if you had a million tutors in Christ, you still wouldn’t have many fathers (i.e., those who were 
instrumental in your conversion)in Christ…Lit: if you were to have ten thousand tutors in Christ, but 
rather not many fathers. Paul didn’t word this well; taking what he meant to say and not what he 
actually did say. Also, the ten thousand is a hyperbole.
*[h]get to where you imitate me…Lit: become imitators of me
*[i]I’d leave immediately and travel as quickly as possible to visit you…Lit: I will go quickly to you
*[j]message…Also: word

*[A]your egos don’t become overly-inflated, with one person thinking himself to be superior in 
understanding something to the one who explained that something to him in the first place, both 
opposed to someone who has a different opinion…Lit: you would be puffed up one above the one against 
another who’s different. Several translators (me included) are not sure what Paul was saying here. In 
cases like these, there may be an idiom present. Also, the appearance of the definite article in above the 
one is emphatic, as many times such an article is dropped after a preposition.
[B]lowliest…Lit: last. Paul sees himself as the lowliest in regard to how comfortable his life is and because 
of his guilt over persecuting the church in his past life. The NT names 24 apostles, and he certainly was 
not the least of all of them.

5|to 
hand a person such as him over to Satan (and to hand him over once and be done with

old yeast thoroughly, so that you’d be a fresh batch of dough the way that you really

8|so that we would not partake of the Passover meal[C] with

“comrade[h]” were to be a fornicator, or someone who’s greedy, or an idolater, or 
someone who cusses or uses abusive language, or a drunkard, or someone who’s 
rapacious—don’t share a meal[i] with them either. 
12|Furthermore, why should I 
care about[j] judging those on the outside? Aren’t you the ones who judge those on the 
inside? 
*[a]stepmother…Lit: father’s wife. Assume this is stepmother and not mother; Paul would’ve simply said 
mother if that were the case.
*[b]by the authority vested in me by our Lord Jesus Christ…Lit: in the name of our Lord Jesus
*[c]my spirit…Lit: the spirit of mine
*[d]and to hand him over once and be done with it…The verb tense of hand over implies and be done with 
it
*[e]talking a big talk…Also: boast
*[f]with bread contaminated by yeast from the previous batch…Lit: old yeast. Since this is a repeat of the 
words old yeast used in v. 7, Paul is referring to the same thing from that verse. 
*[g]unfathomably-wicked evil…Lit: evil and wicked. A hendiadys. Ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[h]comrade…Lit: brother
*[i]share a meal…Lit: eat. This insinuates having fellowship over a meal.
*[j]why should I care about…Lit: what to me
*[k]get rid of…Lit: remove out of. Similar wording as the word removed used in v. 2. This OT quotation is 
likely where Paul based the instruction of v. 2 upon.

*[A]physically-speaking but present spiritually-speaking…Lit: in body but present in spirit, or, in body but 
present in the Spirit. The ambiguity of whether it’s in spirit or in the Spirit is rendered in spirit because of 
the parallelism of in body, and also the phrase the spirit of mine in v.4. The argument on the flip side of 
the coin, to mean in the Spirit: in the spirit with the explicit inclusion of the definite article the majority 
of the time refers to the Holy Spirit.
*[B]will avoid utter calamity when the Lord “settles all Family business” so-to-speak…Lit: will be saved in 
the Day of the Lord. The Day of the Lord is the same as when Michael Corleone tells Carlo “Today I 
settled all Family business” in The Godfather—but of course, the Lord judges in righteousness, but the 
Don did not. The Day of the Lord is the swift, sudden, violent, decisive judgment upon those who 
obviously deserve it, who, from a human perspective, should’ve received it earlier. Paul refers to the 
Day of the Lord in 1 Thess. 5:2, the concept originating foremost from Joel (Joel 1:15; 2:1,11,31; 3:14) 
but occurs in other OT books as well (Amos 5:20; Zeph. 1:7; Zech. 14:1).
*[C]partake of the Passover meal…Lit: celebrate. The Gk. word celebrate is a verb form of the Gk. word 
rendered festival, which in addition to meaning festival refers to religious observances which aren’t 
accompanied by festivity, including simple meals like the Passover meal. But this verse demonstrates the 
metaphor Paul draws comparing Christians to the unleavened bread used in the Passover unleavened 
bread (matzah). Starting with Moses commanding the Israelites to purge every spec of yeast from the 
entire nation and eat matzah instead of real bread for the Passover, yeast and bread infected by it 
symbolize sin, impurity, and the tendency for attitudes—sinful ones in particular—to spread.
*[D]greedy and rapacious…A hendiadys perhaps. The Gk. word for greedy means to want more and more; 
the Gk. word for rapacious means grabbing or seizing things. Also, Paul associates greed, fornication, 
and idolatry in this verse and in Eph. 5:3,5; there are more references in the NT as well. These sins are 
interrelated.
[E]I wrote to you just now…Lit: I wrote to you now. Paul says I wrote instead of I write, using the past 
tense instead of the present to refer to what he’s about to write at the end of the sentence. This would 
make sense if one were to assume that Paul first wrote a draft of this epistle, perhaps on wax tablets, 
made corrections, then copied the edited version onto the scroll which was sent to Corinth.

1|Does any one of you have the audacity to have a civil dispute which you’re 
having with another comrade arbitrated by those who are unrighteous, and not by the 
saints (i.e., your fellow-believers)? 
2|Or are you simply unaware of the fact that the 
saints will judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, you’re capable of 
forming arbitration panels for settling petty disputes. 
3|Don’t you know that we’ll judge 
angels?—We’re that much more capable then of judging day-to-day affairs.
          
4|So when you do happen to form a panel for arbitrating day-to-day affairs, you 
put those in the church who are despised and lowly-esteemed on the panel. 
5|Shame 
on you[a]—Isn’t there even one of you who has wisdom when it comes to this sort of 
thing, someone who can straighten out a situation his comrade is in[b]? 
6|Instead, a 
comrade takes another comrade to court, and the court consists of unbelievers[c]. 

7|You’re already undergoing a complete moral breakdown indeed by taking each 
other to court: why don’t you just be wronged? Why don’t you just be cheated? 

8|Instead of enduring being wronged, you’re wronging and cheating others, and you’re 
doing this to fellow comrades. 
          
9|Don’t you know that those who wrong others won’t inherit the kingdom of 
God (i.e., won’t have a relationship with God; have Him involved with their lives)? 
Don’t be fooled: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor catamites[A] nor 
homosexuals 
10|nor thieves nor the greedy—there’ll be no drunkards, none of those 
who cuss and use abusive language, none of those who are rapacious—these people 
won’t inherit the kingdom of God. 
11|And that’s what some of you were—but no 
more: you were washed, you were sanctified (i.e., separated, set apart, and declared 
holy), you were justified (i.e. examined by a judge and cleared of any charges) by the 
authority[d] of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
          
12|To me, everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial.[B] To 
me, everything’s permissible, but I’ll not be put under the control of anything. 

13|Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach is meant for food, but God will 
do away with food and stomach both. The body’s not meant for fornication but for the 
Lord, and the Lord is meant for the body. 
14|God both raised the Lord from the dead 
and will raise us from the dead through His power.
          
15|Don’t you know that our bodies are a piece of Christ’s body? Shall I take 
these things—shall I take a piece of Christ’s body and make it a piece which is a part of a 
prostitute?—Don’t even think about it[e]. 
16|Don’t you know that he who unites 
with a prostitute or a woman who’s a fornicator becomes[f] a single body with her 
through the bond of sex? “For,” He says, “the two will be made into one flesh.” 
17|The 
one who unites with the Lord becomes a single spirit with him[g]. 
18|Run as fast as 
you can away from fornication (i.e., sexual acts which are immoral): all sins that a 
person happens to commit are done outside the body, but the fornicator commits a sin 
which is done to (or even into) his own body[C]. 
19|Don’t you know that our 
collective-body is a temple which is a dwelling-place for the Holy Spirit to dwell in, 
thereby living among us[D], the Spirit which you have from God, and that you don’t own 
yourselves[h]? 
*[a]Shame on you…Lit: I speak to your shame
*[b]straighten out a situation his comrade is in…Lit: can judge back-from-the-midst of his brother
*[c]a comrade takes another comrade to court, and the court consists of unbelievers…Lit: a brother judges 
[also, seeks a decision] with a brother, and this at unbelievers. Some liberties taken.
*[d]by the authority of…Lit: in the name of
*[e]don’t even think about it…Lit: let it not come-into-being. Ref. note of Rom. 3:4.
*[f]becomes…Lit: is
*[g]becomes a single spirit with him…A mirror of the wording in v. 16, becomes a single body with her
*[h]don’t own yourselves…Lit: are not your own
*[i]glorify…Paul choice of verb tense to make this a harsh command

*[A]catamites…Also: those who are effeminate…Lit: soft to the touch. The commentators aren’t exactly 
sure what this refers to; some say it refers to a man who lives a soft life—which is reasonable. But 
considering that the context is egregious sexual sin, and that the other sins listed in this verse are 
severe, this word here might refer to men who dress like and behave as though they’re women. 
*[B]To me, everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial…Though Paul said that everything is 
permissible, it’s impossible to accept this statement at face-value, as he lists a few things in this chapter 
which are not permissible for anyone to do, stealing and being covetous for example. How is this logical 
dilemma to be solved? Paul is stating his perspective—his philosophy—on whether he will engage in an 
activity or not. Rather than looking at some deed as permissible or forbidden, he changes the 
perspective to look at whether said deed is beneficial or non-beneficial. The understanding is that 
whether it’s permissible or not will logically align with whether it’s beneficial or not. The examples of 
greed and covetousness Paul categorizes as non-beneficial, so it’s irrelevant whether they’re permissible 
or not, since Paul’s not going to do them anyways because they’re non-beneficial. By this reasoning, 
whether something is permissible or not is moot. Adopting this perspective goes a long way to resolving 
the issue of legalism which inevitably arises in the pursuit of religion.
*[C]all sins that a person happens to commit are done outside the body, but the fornicator commits a sin 
which is done to (or even into) his own body…The reason why fornication differs from all other sins, 
being a sin done to your body, is given in the previous verses: a fornicator unites his body with the 
person he commits the act with, and the two become a single body. When a couple is united sexually, 
their bodies merge into one body. Merging your body with someone who’s trash causes your body to be 
corrupted by the trash from the other body.
[D]a temple which is a dwelling-place for the Holy Spirit to dwell in, thereby living among us…Lit: a temple 
among us of [the] Holy Spirit. According to Gk. grammar, the placement of among us between the two 
phrases a temple and of the Holy Spirit indicates the tight coupling of the phrase among us to the other 
two phrases. So Paul’s saying that our bodies form a temple and within this temple the Holy Spirit 
dwells. The analogy is the temple of Jerusalem in which God’s presence dwelled in the Holy of Holies.

1|To elaborate on what I wrote to you in the previous letter, it’s good for a man 
not to go about touching a woman for the purpose of instigating[A] sexual arousal. 

2|But because of the variety and volume of the fornications (i.e., sexual acts which are 
immoral) taking place around you, let each man have his own woman to be his wife, and 
likewise let each woman have her own man to be her husband. 
3|Let the husband 
fulfill his obligation of having sex with his wife; likewise, let the wife do the same with 
her husband. 
4|The wife doesn’t get to dictate what goes on with her own body[a], but 
the husband does; likewise, the husband doesn’t get to dictate what goes on with his 
own body, but the wife does. 
5|Don’t deprive each other of sex, unless it’s for an 
agreed-upon time in order to devote yourselves to prayer, and get back at it[b] (i.e., back 
to having sex) so that Satan not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 
6|In 
saying this, I’m offering you a concession and not giving you a command. 
7|I want all 
men to be like me, but each has his own gift from God instead, one person this way, the 
other person that way.
          
8|I’m telling those who aren’t married or who are widows that it would be 
good if they would stay the way I am. 
9|But if they can’t control themselves, have 
them get married; it’s better to marry than to burn with sexual desire, you see. 
10|To 
those who are already married, I’m having the wives take a command (not me giving the 
command but the Lord) for them not to leave their husbands. 
11|Now if she happens 
to leave[B] him anyways, have her remain single or be reconciled with her husband. And 
I’m having the husbands take a command to not divorce[B] their wives. 
12|I’m telling 
the rest of you (me talking, not the Lord) this: if some man has a wife who’s an 
unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, don’t have him divorce her; 
13|if 
some wife has a husband who’s an unbeliever, and this fellow consents to live with her, 
don’t have her divorce him. 
14|You see, the unbelieving-husband is set apart to 
God as holy and specially protected by Him[c] by the believing wife, and the unbelieving-
wife is set apart as holy and specially protected by the comrade[d] who is her husband; if 
that were not the case, their children would be unholy, spiritually contaminated, and 
not set apart to God[c], but now that there’s a believing spouse in the picture, they’re holy 
and specially protected. 
15|Now if an unbelieving husband or wife leaves his 
believing spouse, let him or her part ways: the comrade, whether man or woman, isn’t 
under any obligation[e] in such case. God has called us to live in peace (i.e., live free of the 
conflict, duress, or affliction that many unbelieving spouse brings) whatever our situation might 
be[C]; 
16|in this regard, how do you know, wives, if you’ll succeed in rescuing your 
unbelieving husbands from spiritual and moral calamity[f]? Or how do you know, 
husbands, if you’ll succeed in rescuing your unbelieving wives from spiritual and moral 
calamity?
          
17|Moving on to topics relevant to every person…Have each person lead his 
life in the way that the Lord deems appropriate for the particular situation he was in 
when he became a believer[D]. I’m giving the same command to all the churches which I 
started. 
18|Had you already been circumcised when called (i.e., had you made a 
vow to obey the Law of Moses prior to becoming a believer )?—Don’t obliterate the 
effects of circumcision[E] (i.e., don’t obliterate the effects of this vow). Was anyone called 
when they were uncircumcised (i.e., did anyone become a believer but at no time ever 
made a vow to obey the Law of Moses)?—Don’t get circumcised (i.e., don’t make such a 
vow). 
19|The circumcision in the case of the believer who was circumcised already is 
irrelevant and not an issue whatsoever, and the uncircumcision in the case of the believer 
who wasn’t circumcised already is irrelevant and not an issue whatsoever, but the keeping 
of God’s commandments is the real issue instead. 
20|Whatever situation or set of 
circumstances a person was in when he was called (i.e., when he became a believer), he 
should stay in that situation or set of circumstances. 
21|Were you called when you 
were a slave?—Don’t worry about it; instead, if you get the chance to gain your freedom, 
by all means take advantage of the opportunity. 
22|Furthermore, the person who 
was called by the Lord (i.e., became a believer) while a slave is the Lord’s freeman; in 
the same way, he who was called while free is Christ’s slave. 
23|You’ve been 
bought at a high price: don’t become other peoples’ slaves. 
24|Whatever situation 
and circumstances each person was in when he was called, comrades, have him remain 
in this situation when he gets with God.
          
25|About the young ladies who have never been married[g]: I don’t have a 
command from the Lord, but I’ll give an opinion as one who’s been shown mercy by 
the Lord enabling me to be reliable. 
26|These are my thoughts about living through 
the difficulties of the present time, namely that it’s good for a person to live the following 
way: 
27|Are you bound by commitment to a wife?—Don’t try to separate from her. 
Separated from a wife?—Don’t go looking for another woman. 
28|But if you do 
happen to get married, you haven’t sinned. And if the typical young lady[g] in the church 
happens to get married, she hasn’t sinned. Folks such as these will face hard times in 
their natural lives[h]; I’m trying to spare you this grief.
          
29|Let me tell you what, comrades, a compressed window of time is all that 
remains of our lives, so that those who have wives should live as though they don’t have 
wives, 
30|and those who weep as though they don’t weep, and those who rejoice as 
though they don’t rejoice, and those who deal in business as though they’ve halted 
trading, 
31|and those using the world as though they don’t use it; when you get 
right down to it, the world we live in in its present form is passing away. 
32|I don’t 
want you to be consumed by or worry about the trivial day-to-day affairs of life. He 
who’s not married is consumed by and worries about the things of the Lord, how he 
might be pleasing to him, 
33|but he who’s married is consumed by and worries 
about things of the world we live in and the people we live around, how he might use 
these things to be pleasing to the wife he has, 
34|and he reaches the point where he’s 
constantly consumed by these and worries about them continually. Both the woman 
who’s single and the young lady who’s never been married are consumed by and worry 
about the things of the Lord, so they would be holy both in body and in spirit. But she 
who’s married is consumed by and worries about the things of the world, how she’s 
going to please her husband. 
35|I’m telling you this for your own benefit—not so I 
can put you on a leash, but so it would result in a seemly, undistracted devotion to the 
Lord.
          
36|Now if someone’s behaving inappropriately towards the young lady he’s 
in a relationship with, and he thinks she might be “overly-ripe[F]” in such a way that 
he’s obliged to make something happen (i.e., she’s pregnant, he thinks it might be too 
hard to hide anymore, and he’ll have to do something about it), let him do what he 
wants to do—he’s not committing a sin in doing so—let them get married. 
37|But he 
who has taken a firm stand in his heart, not having to act out of necessity but has the 
upper-hand over[i] his individual sexual desire, and has decided in his own heart to stay 
a virgin[j] rather than sleep with his girlfriend or fiancée, does well, 
38|with the result 
that both he who waits until marriage handles his virginity well, but he who remains 
single will do better, as he’ll be spared the difficulties I wrote about here.
          
39|The wife is morally bound to her husband as long as her husband lives, but 
if her husband were to pass away, she’s free to marry whom she wants, only she must 
marry in the Lord (i.e., marry in such a way that’s pleasing to the Lord; marry another 
believer). 
*[a]doesn’t get to dictate what goes on with her own body…Lit: doesn’t have authority over her body
*[b]get back at it…Lit: be again at the same
*[c]set apart to God as holy and specially protected by Him…unholy, spiritually contaminated, and not set 
apart to God…Lit: sanctified…unclean. The words sanctified and unclean used together in this verse 
originate in the OT usage of holy and unclean, which carries into the NT.
*[d]comrade…Lit: brother
*[e]under any obligation…Lit: has been enslaved
*[f]succeed in rescuing your unbelieving husbands from spiritual and moral calamity…Lit: save the husband
*[g]young lady who’s never been married…young lady…Lit: virgins…virgin. Ref. note of Matt. 25:1.
*[h]in their natural lives…Lit: in the flesh
*[i]the upper hand over…Also: control over…Lit: authority concerning
*[j]virginity…Lit: the of-oneself virgin. Paul uses the word virgin a few times in this passage, but his use of 
the reflexive pronoun oneself inserted between the definite article and the word virgin selects virginity, 
a secondary meaning of the Gk. word for virgin. Note Paul’s careful insertion of the reflexive pronoun 
both here and in v. 38.

*[A]to go about touching a woman for the purpose of instigating…First, the Gk. verb for touch [haptō, 
(ἅπτω/Strong’s 681)] appears in the present tense, insinuating continuous action rather than a one-time 
act—hence the added phrase go about touching. Second, this verb is unusual in that it has one meaning 
when used in the active voice (to light on fire) and another meaning when used in the middle voice (to 
touch). Since the active voice is the primary tense, the meaning in the middle voice influenced by a hint 
of the meaning from the active voice. Most of the NT occurrences of this verb are in the middle voice, 
and they not only mean to touch but also acquire some of the active voice’s definition to more 
specifically mean to touch for the purpose of instigating something. This verb is used when Jesus touches 
someone to heal them; he touched the person but did so for a purpose. What is “lit on fire” so-to-speak 
is determined by the context, and the context of v. 1 here insinuates touching sexually. To further 
reinforce the point that haptō means more than a simple touch, take a close look at Col. 2:21. Note how 
haptō appears in that passage with thigganō (θιγγάνω/Strong’s 2345). They both mean to touch but 
thigganō means touching without instigating anything; to touch lightly; to brush up against something. 
Had they meant the same thing, Paul wouldn’t have used two different verbs.
*[B]leave…divorce…Different Gk. words are used for leave and divorce here; we infer from this verse here 
and from other NT references (such as Matt. 5:31) that, in ancient times, only the husband had the right 
to instigate a legal divorce. A wife, however, would at times simply leave her husband without fulfilling 
the legalities of a divorce. This might explain the two different words used here.
*[C]God has called us to live in peace (i.e., live free of the conflict, duress, or affliction that many 
unbelieving spouse brings) whatever our situation might be…Lit: God has called us in [or: with; by] peace. 
Apparently, “God has called us to live in peace” means that it’s not God’s will for a Christian to be 
married to a person who’s violent, who’s abusive, who’s reckless, who’s irresponsible to the point of it 
causing harm to the family, etc. Notice that it says “God has called us to live in peace,” and not “God has 
called us to be happy” (Christians shouldn’t necessarily be “happy” but they should have joy). In other 
words, this isn’t a license for a person to divorce simply because he’s unhappy. But it is a license for a 
Christian who was married before he became a Christian to divorce an unbelieving spouse if that spouse 
is causing trouble.
*[D]have each person lead his life in the way that the Lord deems appropriate for the particular situation 
he was in when he became a believer…Lit: as the Lord partitioned [an inheritance] each as God has 
called…Or: as the Lord partitioned [an inheritance] as God has called each. Some guesswork as to what 
exactly Paul was saying. He seems to be making a comparison to dividing an inheritance, the inheritance 
being a biblical theme that refers to the specific plans God has for an individual or a particular group, 
plans which are bespoke for that person or group.
*[E]Don’t obliterate the effects of circumcision…What Paul meant by this can be seen in his own life. Paul 
used the fact that he was circumcised to his advantage from time to time, as he writes later in 9:22, “I 
am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.” Examples are found in Acts 18:18, 
21:23–29.
[F]overly-ripe…Or: beyond her prime…Lit: beyond peak. The passage of vv. 36–38 has puzzled translators, 
and every rendering is not without criticism. To a large extent it hinges on what beyond peak means in 
this context. Some believe it means that the virgin woman is beyond her prime in age, but the meaning 
of beyond peak which best fits the context is a woman who’s pregnant and beginning to show or 
perhaps or is a woman who’s late in her monthly cycle.

1|Now about the issue of eating meat sacrificed to idols, every one of us has our 
own understanding of how this ought to be handled. The understanding a person has on a 
given issue makes him rather full of himself, but the love shown in the handling of said 
issue edifies. 
2|If any given person thinks he’s reached the point where he’s acquired 
some level of understanding, he has not yet understood the matter as it must be 
understood. 
3|If someone loves God, this individual has been known and understood 
by Him.
          
4|So now, about the consumption of food offered to idols: we know for a fact 
that the idols in the world don’t amount to a hill of beans[a], and no person or thing is 
God except for One being only[b]. 
5|Now, granted, there are those who claim there are 
gods, whether they be in the sky, in the atmosphere, among the stars, in a spiritual world 
beyond that, or on the earth, so that there’re many gods and many lords, 
6|but from 
our point of view there’s one God the Father, out of Whom are all things, and we are 
returned to Him and to the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are 
through him.
          
7|That aside, we are not on the same level in every aspect of understanding. Up 
until now some people have been in the habit of eating food sacrificed to idols, and 
since their consciences are weak[A] (i.e., their consciences prod them with pangs of guilt 
over matters they have a deficient understanding of, in this case in regard to food 
sacrificed to idols), they violate[c] their consciences. 
8|Eating or not eating this food 
doesn’t get us anywhere[d] with God: we’re neither worse off if we were to not eat it nor 
are we better off if we were to eat it.
          
9|See to it that the right you have to eat such food doesn’t somehow in and of 
itself become a stumbling block[e] (i.e., an influence for causing sin) for those who have a 
weak conscience. 
10|You see, if someone with a weak conscience were to watch you, a 
person who has the correct understanding on this issue, sitting at the dinner table[f] with 
food sacrificed to idols lying on the plate in front of you, wouldn’t his conscience, because 
it’s in a state of weakness, being built up in regard to the eating of foods sacrificed to 
idols (i.e., because of an incorrect understanding in regard to this issue of food 
sacrificed to idols, his conscience has been conditioned to respond with guilt when it 
ought not)? 
11|You see, he who’s weak—the comrade[g] whom Christ died for—is 
being destroyed by your correct understanding. 
12|In the way that you sin against 
the comrades and beat on their weak consciences, you sin against Christ.

[A]their conscience are weak. In his epistles, Paul talks about four types of consciences: a good 
conscience, an evil conscience, a weak conscience, and a seared conscience. A person’s conscience is 
something that affirms when he’s doing right but condemns when he does wrong. From this context, we 
can deduce that a weak conscience is one which has been programmed with an incorrect understanding 
of the truth and therefore misfires, sending the wrong signals for the wrong reasons, causing a person to 
experience guilt over something he shouldn’t and not experience it over something he should.

13|That’s 
why if food causes my comrade to stumble, there’s no way whatsoever that I’ll ever eat 
sacrificial meat again, so that I won’t be a stumbling block to my brother.


&COR1 9
1|Am I not a freeman? Am I not an apostle (i.e., have I not been sent by God to 
pioneer the spread of Christianity)? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus with my own eyes? 
Are you not my accomplishment in the Lord? 
2|If I’m not an apostle sent to root others 
in Christianity, at least I’m an apostle sent to root you; in fact, you’re my certificate of 
authenticity of my having been sent by the Lord. 
3|My rebuttal to those examining 
me for the purpose of judging and condemning me is the same.
          
4|Do we not have the right to be hosted in such a way that we eat and drink for 
free? 
5|Do we not have the right to have a fellow-comrade-wife accompany us as she 
follows our lead[a] on our journeys and have her hosted as well, as all the other apostles of 
the Lord and Peter[b] do?— 
6|Or is it just Barnabas and I who don’t have the right to 
not have to work to support ourselves? 
7|When did any soldier ever serve in the army 
and have to pay for his own rations? Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t feed off what it 
produces? Or who cares for a ewe and doesn’t feed off the sheep’s milk?
          
8|I’m not talking from a human perspective[c], or talking about concepts that the 
Law does not also talk about. 
9|The fact of the matter is, in the Law of Moses it’s 
written, “Don’t put a muzzle on an oxen while it’s threshing wheat.” You don’t think 
God cares about the welfare of the oxen when it’s threshing, do you? 
10|Or is it that the 
Law’s addressing this topic for our benefit? Furthermore, it’s written in the Law for our 
benefit that the sower ought to sow and the thresher to thresh with the hope of getting a 
percentage of the harvest. 
11|If we sowed into you the Holy Spirit-related things[d] 
which are the backbone of your spiritual lives, is it a big deal if we reap the physical things 
we need to live by from you? 
12|If others have the right of taking a percentage from 
you, don’t we all the more so?
      No, we’re not asserting this right; instead we put up with all kinds of things so 
that nothing would hinder the Gospel, the good-news message of Christ. 
13|Don’t 
you know that they who work the sacred duties in the temple feed on the sacrifices offered 
at the temple; that they who attend to the altar divide the spoils of the altar among 
themselves? 
14|In the same way the Lord planned for and commanded those who 
proclaim the Gospel to make their living from the Gospel. 
15|I have not used any 
of these mandates. I didn’t write about these things to make them happen to me; in fact, 
I’d rather die than have someone invalidate the proud assertions which I openly pride 
myself in. 
16|Should I proclaim the Gospel, it’s not my place to make proud 
assertions, you see: by necessity they’re imposed on me. I’ll be in deep trouble[e], you 
see, should I not proclaim the Gospel. 
17|If I put this into practice voluntarily, you 
see, I’ll earn my pay[f]. If I do this voluntarily, I’ve reached the point where I can be 
entrusted with a managerial position. 
18|So what’s my pay rate? I’m not getting paid 
a penny so that I can present the Gospel free of charge with a view towards me not 
exercising my right to receive financial support as one who proclaims the Gospel.
          
19|Being a freeman, freed from all things, in all things I made myself a slave, 
so that I’d win over the many. 
20|I became a Jew to the Jews so that I would win 
over Jews: to those who live under the Law of Moses, I let myself be under the Law 
(though as far as my own personal life is concerned, I’m not under the Law), so that I 
would win over those under the Law. 
21|I became lawless (i.e., not living under 
the Law of Moses or under any God-based set of rules for that matter) to the lawless 
(though not living lawlessly apart from God, but being law-bound as a part of Christ) in 
order to win over the lawless. 
22|I became powerless to control my own 
circumstances[g] to those who are powerless over their circumstances so that I would 
win over the powerless. I became all things to all people so I’d save (i.e., rescue from 
calamity, spiritual, moral, and otherwise) some. 
23|But everything I do, I do for the 
sake of the proclamation of the Gospel so I’d become a workman who specializes in it.
          
24|Don’t you know that those who compete in track & field run races but 
only one of them gets the first-place trophy[A]? Play to win—that’s the way you 
compete.[h] 
25|Everyone who competes in athletics trains, and those folks do so in 
order to get a trophy which can and undoubtedly will lose its prestige over time[i], but we 
train to win a trophy[j] which will always remain prestigious; 
26|hence, as far as I’m 
concerned, I don’t train for the race without setting any specific personal goals to meet[k]. 
I train to box in such a way that in the ring I’ll land punches and not wind up with 
fistfuls of air[l]. 
*[a]to have a fellow-comrade-wife accompany us as she follows our lead…Lit: to lead about a sister-

(Rom. 3:5); undesirable human tendencies (1 Cor. 3:3).

[A]only one of them gets the first-place trophy…In ancient Greek culture, there was no second or third 
place, etc. You either win or lose. There’s no distinction if you were to barely come in second place or if 
you were to come in last place.

27|Uh-uh—I apply strict, punishing disciple to my body (i.e., to my 
carnal nature in particular), treating it roughly and wearing it down; I subdue it and 
make it my slave, lest I, having proclaimed the Gospel to others, should somehow or 
someway fail to live up to the standard it sets.


&COR1 10
1|I don’t want you to fail to understand this, comrades[a], the fact that our 
forefathers—all of them—were always under the cloud which they followed after leaving 
Egypt, and all of them passed through the Red Sea, 
2|and every one of them was 
initiated into and joined up with Moses in totality[A] by virtue of the cloud and the sea[b], 

3|and every one of them was fed from the same spiritual food, 
4|and every one of 
them drank from the same spiritual source: they drank out of the Spiritual Trailing Rock 
(and the rock was Christ).
          
5|But God was not pleased with many of them; their dead bodies were strewn 
about the wilderness as we see. 
6|Now the lives these people led is an example, a 
pattern, a parallel of our own lives, so that we not have strong yearnings bordering on 
sensual passions for evil, just as some of them had. 
7|Neither become idolaters, just as 
some of them did, as it’s written in the Old Testament,

The folk-people sat down to eat and drink
And when they were done got up to play[B]

          
8|Nor commit fornication (i.e., behave in a sexually immoral way), just as some 
of them committed fornication, and as a result twenty-three thousand dropped dead in 
one day. 
9|Nor test Christ (i.e., use a circumstance as a test to see if Christ will pass 
from your point of view), just as some of them tested him and as a result were destroyed 
by serpents. 
10|Nor grumble, murmur, or complain just as some of them grumbled 
and as a result were destroyed by the Destroyer.
          
11|Now those things that happened to them turned out to be an example, a 
pattern, a parallel of our own lives, and it was recorded in the Bible to make us aware 
that this applies to us, whom the ends of the ages[C] have arrived at and are staring us in 
the face, 
12|so that the one who thinks he stands (i.e., the one who thinks he’s 
immune to sin) should see to it that he doesn’t fall (i.e., fall to sin). 
13|No 
temptation has been taken hold of by the person being tempted if it were not for the fact 
that humans are susceptible to it. But God is faithful, Who won’t permit us to be 
tempted beyond what we’re capable of. No, He’ll make an exit strategy consisting of the 
ability to bear the temptation while under the weight of it.
          
14|Therefore, my dear comrades, get as far away from the idolatry you’re 
surrounded with as fast as you can. 
15|I’m talking to you as though I’m speaking to 
sensible people. You decide the sensibility of what I’m saying. 
16|The cup of 
blessing (i.e., the cup of communion wine) which we pronounce a blessing with, is it not 
an intimate association with the blood of Christ? The loaf of bread which we break 
during communion, is it not an intimate association with the body of Christ[D]? 

17|Because the loaf is a single entity, we the many are one body; we all partake of 
pieces which come out of the one loaf, you see. 
          
18|Take a look at Israel, physically speaking: don’t they who feed 
themselves with the meat of the sacrificial animals have an intimate association with the 
altar and share in the work which goes on there? 
19|So what exactly am I trying to 
tell you[c]? That idolatry is something which needs to be taken seriously[d]? Or that food 
sacrificed to an idol is something which needs to be taken seriously? 
20|Uh-uh—What 
they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God; I don’t want an intimate 
association between you and demons to form. 
21|You can’t be drinking from the 
Lord’s cup (i.e., following the Lord’s plan for your lives[e]) and from demons’ cup; you 
can’t be partaking of the Lord’s table (i.e., receiving the Lord’s provision for your 
nourishment[f], and for all of your needs for that matter) and of the demons’ table. 

22|Or do you intend to provoke the Lord to wrath[g]? We aren’t more powerful than 
he, are we?
          
23|Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial.[h] Everything 
is permissible, but not everything edifies. 
24|Let no one pursue his own interests 
exclusively[i] but the next person’s as well. 
25|Eat any sort of meat which is sold at 
the marketplace without any qualms[j]; the Bible says, 
26|“The abundant, splendid 
variety of things that the earth contains was put there by the Lord’s doing[k],” you see. 

27|If someone who’s an unbeliever invites you over to his house and you want to 
go, eat everything that’s laid out on the table or put on your plate without having any 
qualms about eating any of it. 
28|If someone were to tell you, “This is meat which 
was sacrificed in a pagan ritual,” don’t eat it on account of that person who pointed it out 
and because of the misgivings surrounding it—
29|I don’t mean because of your own 
misgivings but because of the other person’s. Now just why is what I’m free to do or not 
do decided by another person’s misgivings? 
30|If I partake in the eating of certain 
foods by means of grace (i.e., using the license I’ve been given), why are terrible things 
said about me in connection with He Whom I offer up thanksgiving to? 
31|So 
whether you eat or don’t eat something or whether you drink or don’t drink something or 
whether you do or don’t do anything else, everything you end up doing, do to God’s glory. 

32|Get to where you’re not inadvertently causing a Jew or Westerner[l] or anyone in 
God’s church to get offended or to fall to temptation, 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers

used in Gal. 6:3; the meaning of it can be inferred from that passage.
*[e]drinking from the Lord’s cup (i.e., following the Lord’s plan for your lives)…The metonymy of the cup is 
best understood from its usage in Matt. 20:22; Mark 10:38 and in others.
*[f]partaking of the Lord’s table (i.e., receiving the Lord’s provision for your nourishment)…The metonymy 
of the table is best understood from its usage in 2 Sam. 9:7–13; 1 Kings 4:27; Neh. 5:17; Psalm 23:5; 
69:22; 78:19 and in others.
*[g]do you intend to provoke the Lord to wrath…Lit: are you provoking the Lord to wrath [also, to jealousy].
*[h]Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial…Paul repeats what he said in earlier in 6:12; 
Ref. note there.
*[i]his own interests exclusively…Lit: the things of himself
*[j]qualms…Lit: judging through the conscience
*[k]The abundant, splendid variety of things that the earth contains was put there by the Lord’s doing…Lit: 
the earth and its fullness [are] of the Lord. The earth and its fullness is a hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 
3:11.
*[l]a Westerner…Lit: a Greek

*[A]was initiated into and joined up with Moses in totality…Lit: were baptized into Moses. The usage of 
baptize here anchors its definition in the NT. In my opinion, the most complete definition of baptidzō 
(βαπτίζω/Strong’s 907), the Gk. word for to baptize, is the definition that James H. Strong gives: whelm. 
Ref. Luke 12:50. The Israelites passing through the Red Sea is symbolic of baptism.
*[B]The folk-people sat down to eat and drink and when they were done got up to play…At first, this 
quotation seems irrelevant with respect to idolatry, that other verses from Exod. would’ve been better 
suited to highlight the golden calve story, but the opposite is true: it is an accurate description. Idolatry 
is attributing care, provision, and protection (in Bible terms, the saving and the salvation) to a false god, 
to worship that god as being the provider, celebrating the fact that he cares and provides for you. The 
eating, drinking, and playing points to this celebration.
*[C]the ends of the ages…This expression is similar to “Last Days” (ref. note of John 6:39), and both lend 
support to the idea of there being different ages of mankind. Furthermore, God’s dealings with man 
change from age to age, and there’s a progression as mankind passes through the ages. Quoting 
Wikipedia, “At the core of dispensationalism is the concept that God has acted in different ways in 
dealing with his chosen people throughout human history.” The ends of the ages is the age in which God 
makes available the ability to come to Him through Christ directly. The ends (plural) is not only the 
singular command to accept Christ but also includes outpourings of the Holy Spirit.
[D]an intimate association with the body of Christ…Lit: a fellowship [also a commonality] of the body of 
Christ. This verse adds clarification to what Jesus meant when he held up the bread and said “This is my 
body” (Luke 22:19). Partaking in the communion bread is fellowship with the body of Christ, but Jesus 
didn’t literally mean that the bread becomes his body.

&COR1 11
1|Imitate me, just as I too imitate Christ.[a]
          
2|I applaud you since you keep in the front of your mind my entire collection 
of teaching[b] and you firmly adhere to the instruction as I presented and entrusted it to 
you. 
3|I want you to know for certain that Christ is the head of every man[A]; the man 
which God created is the head of woman; God is the head of Christ. 
4|Any man who 
has something down over his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.[B] 

5|Any woman who’s praying or prophesying with her head unveiled disgraces her 
head: it’s the same thing as having her hair cut off, in fact; 
6|for if a woman isn’t 
veiled, have her cut her hair off too. If it’s disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut 
off or her head shaved, have her put a veil on.
          
7|In regard to this topic, a man certainly doesn’t have to put a veil over his 
head, as his very existence is as God’s image and glory[c] (i.e., His crowning 
achievement in creation; His pride and joy; what He treasures the most; His 
complement), but the woman is man’s glory (i.e., man’s pride and joy; what he 
treasures above all else; the reflection of the finest in him; his complement). 
8|You see, 
man isn’t derived from woman[d], but the other way around: woman is derived from man. 

9|Also, taking a closer look at this, man wasn’t created because of the woman, but 
rather woman was created because of the man. 
10|Because of this the woman ought 
to have control over her head because of the angels.[C] 
11|Nevertheless in the Lord 
neither does woman exist apart from man nor does man exist apart from woman; 

12|for just as the woman was created out of the man, in the same way as that the 
man too is birthed through the woman, and all the things we see in creation come out of 
God.
          
13|Decide among yourselves: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God while 
unveiled? 
14|Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man were to wear his 
hair long, it would surely be dishonorable for him to do so? 
15|But if a woman were 
to wear her hair long, it would be glory to her (i.e., it would magnify her, highlighting 
and complementing her; it would be a point of pride for her)? Because the long hair has 
been given to her as a substitute for an article of clothing she would wrap around 
herself. 
16|But in case someone’s thinking about starting an argument over this, we 
don’t have such a custom, nor do any one of the other of God’s churches.
          
17|While preparing the command I’m about to give you, I didn’t have 
anything good to say about you, since your getting together as a group is not for the 
better but for the worse. 
18|More to the point, at the head of the list is the reports 
that I hear that there are divisions which constantly exist among you when you get 
together as a church, and I believe that at least some of it is true. 
19|Furthermore, 
there has got to be factions among you, where each faction consists of the people who 
share the same opinion about something, so that it’s become evident that those who 
decide what does or doesn’t fly have come to the forefront among you.
          
20|So your coming together at the same gatherings isn’t to partake of the 
Lord’s meal, is it? 
21|At the meal served at the gathering, each person in fact gets a 
head-start on his eating with the idea of getting more than the next guy, and as a result 
one fellow goes hungry on the one hand, while one fellow gets drunk on the other. 

22|Furthermore, don’t you have pubs and restaurants[e] for eating and drinking at? 
Or do you have contempt for the church of God and humiliate those who don’t have 
enough to get by on? What was I supposed to tell you? Was I supposed to applaud you for 
doing this? I don’t have any applause in this particular case.
          
23|Delving into this topic more deeply, I received from the Lord and took to 
heart that which I also presented and entrusted to you, that the night the Lord Jesus was 
betrayed and arrested, he took a loaf, 
24|prayed, broke it, and said,

This is my body which is
Lifted up, broken, and distributed for your sakes.[D]
Do this for the purpose of refreshing your memories of me.


25|In the same fashion he also took the cup while dining, saying,

This cup is the new covenant ratified by means of my blood.
As often as you choose to or happen to drink from the cup,
Do this for the purpose of refreshing your memories of me.


26|For as often as you happen to or choose to eat this bread and drink this cup, you 
proclaim the death of the Lord until whatever time he ends up coming, 
27|so that 
he who perchance eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be 
culpable of the body and the blood of the Lord. 
28|Have a person examine and test 
himself and prove to himself and approve of himself, and have him eat from the loaf 
and drink from the cup in this manner; 
29|you see, he who eats and drinks the 
communion meal unworthily eats and drinks judgment (i.e., a guilty verdict) upon himself 
by not evaluating the body. 
30|For this reason many of you are weak and frail (i.e., 
are run down with a long-running illness or have maladies[f]), and a good number of 
you are in the process of dying[g]. 
31|If we were to examine and judge ourselves 
(i.e., examine ourselves and acknowledge our own guilt), we would not be judged and 
pronounced guilty. 
32|Being judged by the Lord, you are disciplined, trained, and 
corrected, so that you won’t be condemned together with the world (i.e., with the 
unbelievers and the entire ungodly system they created). 
33|Rember this, my 
comrades[h], so that when gathering together for the purpose of eating, wait for one 
another rather than getting a head-start on eating. 
*[a]Imitate me, just as I too imitate Christ…This appears to be a dangling sentence that should’ve been 
appended to the end of the previous chapter.
*[b]my entire collection of teaching…Lit: my all [everything]
*[c]God’s image and glory…This may be a hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11. If this is the case, it would be 
rendered God’s image in all of its wonderful glory.
*[d]derived from woman…Lit: out of woman
*[e]pubs and restaurants…Lit: houses. The Gk. word for house also means building in a generic sense, a 
building which is not a residence. In this context, Paul seems to be referring to establishments and not 
homes per se.
*[f]run down with a long-running illness or have maladies…Ref. note of Matt. 4:23
*[g]dying…Lit: sleeping. Ref. 1 Cor. 7:39.
*[h]comrades…Lit: brothers

*[A]the man which God created is the head of woman…Lit: the man is the head of woman. The Gk. words 
for man and woman used here are used in some of Paul’s other writings (1 Cor. 7:1–3; Eph. 5:22–23; 1 
Tim. 2) and elsewhere in the NT to refer to husband and wife, introducing the potential for ambiguity. 
Paul was cognizant of this as he was committing his words to paper (parchment, actually) and explicitly 
selected wife or husband by saying own woman and own man in 1 Cor. 7:2 and own man in Eph. 5:22. 
Since own woman or own man doesn’t appear in the 1 Cor. 11 passage referenced here, Paul means 
man and woman. The context favors this conclusion as well.
*[B]Any man who has something down over his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head…One 
can only speculate as to what exactly Paul is talking about in this passage. Having said that, cultural 
traditions stretch back for millennia, traditions where women wear head covering. It appears that Paul is 
talking about a tradition which was peculiar to the Corinthians, where it was shameful for a man to have 
something over his head in a public forum of some sort, while it was shameful for a woman to not have 
something over her head in the same forum. There’s a parallel between one’s head which is a body part 
and one’s head which is the next level up in the submission chain (Paul speaks of the “head” in Eph. 5:23 
the same way). So the woman not having a covering over her head would be seen as a sign of disrespect 
to her head, to man.
*[C]Because of this the woman ought to have control over her head because of the angels…Speculation 
again due to the ambiguity in this verse. The Gk. words for have control over can also be rendered be 
having authority. The phrase through the angels can be rendered in a couple of variations such as by 
means of the angels, on account of, or through the angels. The question is whether her head (lit., the 
head) in this verse refers to the woman’s physical head or to her higher-up (man). Assuming that the 
latter is the case and that head here doesn’t refer to her physical head, then this would mean that the 
woman exercises power, authority, and control over the man, but it is done by means of the angels. This 
agrees with Paul’s previous observation that woman came out of man, but man is birthed by woman; 
both woman comes from man, and man comes from woman; neither is superior; both are dependent on 
the other. This is simply a restatement of v. 12. In keeping with this, the woman has authority (has 
control over) the man, a control which is accomplished on a spiritual level by the employment of angels.

&COR1 12
1|Concerning spirituals[A] (things which are of nature related to the Holy Spirit: 
i.e., spiritual gifts, ministries, and extraordinary manifestations of the Holy Spirit), 
comrades[a], I don’t want you to fail to understand this. 
2|You know for a fact that 
when you were pagans in close contact with[b] the mute and dumb idols, as long as[c] you 
kept on being led[d] by the evil spirits those idols attracted, you were being led astray. 

3|This is why I’m making you understand that no one while speaking by means of the 
Spirit of God says “Jesus is accursed,” and no one when speaking by the influence of a spirit 
can say “Jesus is Lord” except if the influence is by the Holy Spirit.
          
4|Now there’s a variety of gifts, gifts which are freely given by God as an act of 
grace and not as something which have been earned by the recipient, but the same 
Spirit. 
5|And there are a variety of ministries, but the same Spirit still. 
6|And there 
are a variety of effects produced by the Holy Spirit, but the same God Who works every 
little piece of everything[e]. 
7|To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the 
common good. 
8|In this regard, through the Spirit is given to one person[B] the word of 
wisdom, but on the other hand to another person the word of knowledge according to 
the same Spirit, 
9|to another special faith by the same Spirit, but to another gifts of 
healings[C] by the same Spirit, 
10|but to another the working of miracles, but to 
another prophecy, but to another the discerning of spirits, but to another a different kind 
of tongue, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
11|The one-in-the-same Spirit 
works all of these gifts, ministries, and effects, divvying them up and parceling them out 
to each individual just the way He wants.
          
12|In fact, just as the body is a single unit and has many parts, and all the 
parts, even though there’s many of them, comprise one body, it’s the same way with 
Christ. 
13|You see, every one of us was inducted[f] into one body by one Spirit, 
whether a given person was Jewish, was a Westerner[g], whether a slave or freeman—all 
of us have been made to drink of the water of life from one Spirit; 
14|for the body does 
not consist of one part only but of many parts. 
15|If the foot were to say, “I’m not a 
hand—I’m not one of the parts the body has,” then because of this claim it’s not a 
constituent body part? 
16|And if the ear were to say, “I’m not an eye, I’m not part 
of the body,” because of saying this, it’s not part of the body? 
17|If the entire body 
was just one giant eye, how would you hear? If the entire body was just one giant ear, 
how could you smell anything?
          
18|So as it turns out God put every one of the parts into position just the 
way He wanted. 
19|If every little piece[h] was one type of part only, where would 
that leave the body? 
20|It turns out that while there’re many parts indeed, there’s 
but one body. 
21|The eye can’t get away with telling the hand “I don’t need you”; 
furthermore, the head can’t tell the feet “I don’t need you” either. 
22|No—the parts 
of the body which seem to be weaker are more necessary than they appear to be. 

23|We assign a greater value to the parts of the body we deem to be of little 
value[D], and we put a greater amount of clothing over our private parts to ensure that 
they’re well-hidden, 
24|but the valuable parts have no need of that. No—God 
composed—He blended together and mixed—the body by having given more value to 
those parts lacking it 
25|so there wouldn’t be division in the body, but that the 
members would care for each other treating each other the same way. 
26|If a single 
member happens to suffer, all the members suffer along with it. If a single member is 
glorified, all the members are glorified along with it.
          
27|Now you all are Christ’s body, and you as the individual members 
populate the various body parts[i]. 
28|God has indeed placed in the church first 
apostles (i.e., missionaries sent out to pioneer new Christian works), second prophets, 
third teachers, those who perform miracles, gifts of healings, those who help in any of a 
multitude of ways[j], administrations (i.e., guidance, governorship: literally the one who 
steers the ship), various tongues. 
29|Not everyone’s an apostle, are they? Not 
everyone’s a prophet, are they? Not everyone’s a teacher, are they? Not everyone 
performs miracles, do they? 
30|Not everyone has one of the various gifts of healings, 
do they? Not everyone speaks in tongues, do they? Not everyone interprets messages in 
tongues, do they[E]? 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]in close contact with…Lit: with. Same usage of the word with as John used in the phrase the Concept 
was with God (John 1:1).
*[c]as long as…A minor definition of the Gk. word hōs (ὡς/Strong’s 5613)used here (a definition found in 
Thayer’s concordance). Justified by the context.
*[d]kept on being led….According to Max & Mary, the Gk. particle an inserted here emphasizes the 
continuous action insinuated by the imperfect tense of the verb to be led.
*[e]every little piece of everything…Lit: the all in all. Same expression used 1 Cor. 15:28; Eph. 1:23
*[f]inducted…Lit: baptized
*[g]Westerner…Lit: Greek
*[h]every little piece…Lit: the alls. Used in v. 6 also.
*[i]you as the individual members populate the various body parts…Lit: [you are] members out of [the] 
parts
*[j]those who help in any of a multitude of ways…Lit: helps. The Gk. word for help literally means one who 
takes hold of something in place of another. Also, ref. note concerning gifts of healings in v. 28.

*[A]spirituals…The Gk. word pneumatikos (πνευματικός/Strong’s 4152). The Gk. noun pneuma (spirit, 
πνεῦμα/Strong’s 4151) terminated with the adjective ending tikos, a suffix which “marks ability or 
fitness” of the verb it appends according to Bullinger. The adjective, having been formed, is used 
substantively as a noun in this verse, forming a new noun. This new Gk. noun means “belonging to or of 
pneuma; of the pneuma.” As pneuma has multiple meanings—a spiritual being (the Holy Spirit, a human 
spirit, a demonic spirit); related to things of the spirit; prevailing attitude—pneumatikos acquires these 
flavors of meaning: related to or of the Holy Spirit; related to or of a human spirit; or simply the word 
spiritual as it’s understood in English. Though Paul didn’t invent this word, he coined the usage of it in 
the NT. The meaning of pneumatikos in Paul’s writings is best understood from the way Paul uses it and 
from firsthand Christian experience—not from what’s written in the lexicons. When pneumatikos 
appears in the NT, the context will guide you as to which of these various definitions to use. In v. 1 here, 
the context suggests things related to or pertaining to the Holy Spirit, where Holy Spirit is a synecdoche 
which refers to his workings, similar to the way Holy Spirit is used a synecdoche to refer to the baptism 
in the Holy Spirit (an example being Acts 8:15). So pneumatikos as used here refers to things that the 
Holy Spirit does and not the Holy Spirit himself per se. This is not the case in other NT usages of 
pneumatikos, as pneumatikos’s meaning is context-dependent.
*[B]through the Spirit is given to one person…The nine items listed in this passage, the Gifts of the Spirit, 
are all supernatural workings of the Holy Spirit, in spite of some of these item’s titles, titles which 
suggest that they are personal qualities. Among such titles is the first, the word of wisdom; the Gk. word 
for word in this context means a piece of information. The word wisdom, apart from meaning wisdom, 
also means sophistication, cleverness, highly-skilled in a specific area, and even cunning. For the second 
item, the word of knowledge, the Gk. word for knowledge means knowledge or understanding which 
isn’t obtained through the physical senses. Faith , the third item, must be talking about faith of a 
supernatural type, not to be confused with personal faith, which all believers must have and are 
encouraged to grow in.
Pentecostal tradition (and the Pentecostals have studied this passage the most) defines the spiritual 
gifts as follows:
Word of wisdom—supernatural understanding of some future event
Word of knowledge—supernatural knowledge of a current or past event
Special faith—supernatural faith to receive a miracle
Gifts of healings— spectacular healings, usually instantaneous
Working of miracles—just like it sounds
Prophecy—Holy Spirit-inspired utterance
Discerning of spirits—the ability to see into the spiritual world; seeing angels or demons
Tongues—Holy Spirit-inspired utterance in an unknown language
Interpretation of tongues—Holy Spirit-inspired interpretation of an utterance in tongues
*[C]gifts of healings…This is gifts of healings (plural) not gift of healing (singular). There is no single, 
generic gift of healing, rather there are a multitude of specialty healing gifts just like there’s a multitude 
of doctors who are specialists. Those who have a healing gift will usually excel at healing certain types or 
categories of disorders more than others. Similarly, when this same verse mentions helps, it does so in 
the plural instead of singular because there’s a wide variety of helps ministries, and therefore people 
tend to specialize in one specific type of helps ministry.
*[D]have little value…Also: handle the necessary but distasteful body functions…Lit: dishonorable. Paul may 
be referring to hair: it has little functional value and serves little function, but gets dressed, clothed, and 
is something which is of value to us.
*[E]Not everyone speaks in tongues, do they? Not everyone interprets messages in tongues, do they…Lit: 
not all speak in tongues; not all interpret. Keep in mind that what’s spoken about in vv. 27–31 are 
ministries, a subset of the “spirituals” specified in v. 1. Ministry gifts are full-time callings, such as an 
apostle or teacher, a vocation that the Holy Spirit calls a person to and enables him to do on a regular 
basis. A ministry is done for the benefit of the body and not for a personal edification. As such, the 
tongues listed in v. 30 is a vocation, a ministry, something done for the edification of the body. Not 
everyone has this ministry. But there is another kind of tongues described in 14:4 which is for personal 
edification. The restriction of “not everyone speaks in tongues” doesn’t apply to the speaking in tongues 
done for personal edification.
[F]Yet I’ll show you a way which is superior to this…Lit: And yet I show you according to superior way…The 
introduction to the 13th chapter. What is written about in the 12th chapter is a good way: miraculous 
manifestations by the Holy Spirit; the entire body of Christ working together in harmony. But it gets 
better.

1|If I were to speak in tongues of men and of angels but not have love, I will 
have become a blaring brass instrument[a] or clanging cymbal. 
2|If I were to have a 
prophecy and that prophecy would give me the answers to life’s questions so I would know for 
certain[A] all the mysteries and all the knowledge and understanding, or[b] if I were to 
have all the faith so as to move mountains from place to place, but not have love, I am 
nothing. 
3|And if I were to sell everything I own and tender my body to be burned, 
but not have love, it is helping me nothing.
          
4|The love of which I speak is patient, the love is kind, isn’t jealous and doesn’t 
cause rivalry, doesn’t vaunt itself and act as a show-off, isn’t full of itself, 
5|doesn’t act 
unseemly or indecently, doesn’t seek its self-interest[c], doesn’t gaslight others, doesn’t 
keep a mental scorecard of the bad things done to it, 
6|doesn’t rejoice at the 
wrongdoing of others but joins in the rejoicing in the truth; 
7|it endures all things, 
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
          
8|The love of which we speak never breaks down[d]. Should there be prophecies, 
they’ll be done away with; should there be tongues, they’ll cease; should there be 
knowledge and understanding, it’ll be done away with.[B][C] 
9|The fact of the matter is 
that we know and understand from the perspective of a part of the whole and we prophecy 
from the perspective of a part, 
10|but when the Complete comes, the Partial will be 
done away with. 
11|When I was a child, I was talking like a child, was thinking 
like a child, was reasoning like a child—when I became a man, I did away with the 
things of childhood. 
12|Furthermore, at the moment we’re seeing life as though we’re 
looking at the vague reflection cast by a mirror, but some time in the future we’ll look at 
life as though we’re looking at it face-to-face; at the moment my knowing and 
understanding comes out of a single part of the whole, but some time in the future I’ll 
know and understand life exactly just as I have been known and understood by God 
exactly.

*[A]know for certain…The Gk. verb oida (οἶδα/Strong’s 1492), in contrast to the Gk. root verb ginōskō 
(γινώσκω/Strong’s 1097)used for knowledge and understanding in this verse. Oida is knowing by seeing 
(by physical sense); ginōskō is understanding something which is abstract. This difference is exemplified 
in 2 Cor. 5:16, where both ginōskō and oida are used in the same verse. Furthermore, in this verse Paul 
said “if I were to have a prophecy” and not “if I were to prophesy.” In other words, Paul said “if I were to 
possess a prophecy” and not “if I were to prophesy [i.e. speak a prophetic utterance].” He goes on to 
insinuate that the prophecy would contain the answers to the mysteries of life—hence the choice of the 
word oida instead of ginōskō when he said “know all the mysteries, etc.”
*[B]Should there be prophecies, they’ll be done away with; should there be tongues, they’ll cease; should 
there be knowledge and understanding, it’ll be done away with…Some have used this verse as a basis to 
argue that prophecies and tongues have ceased because the time for it to cease has come already. But 
notice that Paul mentions three things: prophecy, tongues, and knowledge. All three of these will cease 
at the same time, and not just two of three. It’s obvious that the third item knowledge hasn’t ceased 
yet, therefore the other two haven’t either.
[C]knowledge and understanding, it’ll be done away with…There is a time coming, as specified in the v. 
10, when the “perfect” will come, and the “partial” will be done away with. Has this time come yet? No, 
it couldn’t have. Verse 8 lists three things that will cease when this time arrives: prophecy, tongues, and 
knowledge. Not one, not two, but all three will cease. Some have taught in the past that this time 
arrived when the last book of the Bible was written, therefore tongues and prophecy have ceased. But 
what about knowledge? Paul tells us in a few other places in his epistles that he desires for Christians to 
increase in knowledge-certainly it has not ceased, and therefore the fulfillment cannot have been the 
completion of the NT canon.
But there is coming a time—probably after death—when all three will cease, including knowledge. One 
might see why tongues and prophecy will cease, but what about knowledge? Does this mean that when 
we get to heaven, we’ll forget everything we knew on the earth? I should think not. The answer lies a bit 
deeper, specifically in an understanding of the Gk. word used for know. NT Gk. has two principle verbs 
for “to know,” and from the verbs all the other forms, in this case the nouns, are derived. The first word 
is oida, and it's actually an awkward form of another verb which means “to see.” The other word is 
gnōskō. Oida and ginōskō, although both translated "to know", have distinct meanings. Oida means to 
know because a fact or thing is obvious, it’s something one knows because one has seen it, hence the 
connection to the verb “to see.” Ginōskō, on the other hand, refers to knowledge that one has obtained 
without the use of the senses. Ginōskō involves a level of abstraction, or reasoning, to arrive at the thing 
known, since it’s not directly discernable. For example, I “oida” that the shirt I’m wearing is red, but I 
“ginōskō “ that the spare-penny dish at the checkout line at the convenience store is usually empty, 
because people are more apt to reach for a penny when they’re two or three cents short of the next 
dollar than they are to remember to put their spare pennies in the dish. Ginōskō is also a root used to 
derive other words, but in every case the meaning still involves some thought process. Hence, ginōskō 
or its derivatives are, among others, translated “understand,” “discern,” or “recognize.” In the NT, 
ginōskō is sometimes used in reference to spiritual knowledge, because spiritual things cannot be seen, 
and faith, by nature, believes in what one cannot see, and therefore is always abstract.
But there’s coming a day when the faith necessary to believe in God won’t be necessary, because we 
won’t be living on this earth anymore. All ginōskō knowledge will be replaced with oida knowledge, 
which will not cease—only ginōskō knowledge will. Questions and mysteries will be done away with too, 
at that time. But while we’re still here on earth, there are certain things we must know without having 
seen, or having conclusive proofs demonstrated to us. There’s things that also happen to us, or to others 
we know, that are a mystery. Why did this tragedy occur? Many ask, was it God’s will? Where was God 
in all of this? A lot of things we don’t—nor ever will—know the answer to, not here on this earth. This 
doesn’t mean that there’s not a good explanation for it; what it does mean is that the explanation is 
beyond our reach. Often when people don’t have the answer, they must fill that unknowing in them and 
produce their own explanation, and often this results in speculations about God’s will. This has become 
the source of a lot of poor doctrine. Just accept the fact that there are certain things that we’ll never 
understand in this lifetime until the perfect comes, but that there’s probably a good explanation for 
these things.

1 Cor.
13|At the present time faith, hope, and love remain—these three—but the 
greatest of them is love.


&COR1 14
1|Pursue love and have a burning desire for the spirituals (i.e., spiritual gifts 
and manifestations of the Holy Spirit), but more so that you would prophesy than speak 
in tongues. 
2|You see, the one who speaks in tongues isn’t talking to people when he’s 
speaking in tongues but is talking to God instead. In fact no one hears him speak 
intelligibly: he speaks mysteries by his spirit[a]. 
3|Converseley, the one who prophesies 
speaks edification; exhortation, encouragement, comfort, advice; and consolation to 
people. 
4|The one who speaks in tongues edifies himself (i.e., builds himself up); the 
one who prophesies edifies the church. 
5|I want all of you to speak in tongues and 
speak in tongues, but more so that you would prophesy and prophesy. The one who 
prophesies is more important[b] than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he were to 
interpret what was spoken in tongues, so that the church would receive edification.
          
6|So now, comrades[c], if I were to go up to you and proceed to speak[d] in 
tongues, how would it benefit you, except if I were to convey a revelation, an 
understanding, a prophecy, or a teaching[e]? 
7|Nevertheless the inanimate objects 
which are designed to produce specific, coherent sound patterns, whether we’re talking 
about a flute or a harp[f]—if one of them were to not put out distinct musical notes, how 
will the flute-playing or harp-playing be comprehensible? 
8|Furthermore, if a bugle 
were to play an indistinguishable tune, who would get into position for battle? 

9|Similarly, if you were to not form intelligible words in whatever language you 
speak in, how would what’s spoken be comprehensible? The fact of the matter is that 
you would just be wasting your breath[g]. 
10|Who knows just how many different 
languages there are worldwide, and none of them consists of a set of incomprehensible 
sounds. 
11|So if I were to not have the voice-control to utter words correctly in a 
given language, from the perspective of the person I’m speaking to, I’ll appear to 
whomever I’m speaking to as though I’m a person from another country who can’t 
speak the native language[h], and he’ll appear the same way to me. 
12|Likewise, 
you too, since you are zealous of spirituals (i.e., manifestations of the Holy Spirit), seek 
that which furthers the edification of the church.
          
13|In light of this, let the one speaking in tongues pray that he would 
interpret what he’s speaking. 
14|You see, if I were to pray in tongues, my spirit 
would be praying but my mind wouldn’t be involved in the production of the words[i]. 

15|So what’s the conclusion? I will pray in the Spirit[j], but I will pray also with the 
mind. I will sing a song[A] of praise to the Lord in the Spirit, but I will also sing a song with 
the mind. 
16|Otherwise, if you were to give a praise, blessing, or consecration with 
the spirit, a person who isn’t versed in the things of the Spirit and doesn’t speak in 
tongues[B]—how will he say “amen” (i.e., speak a verbal affirmation) upon hearing Your 
Blessing[k], since he doesn’t know what you’re saying? 
17|For you certainly give a 
blessing well, but the other person who’s not versed in the things of the Spirit doesn’t get 
anything out of it. 
18|I give God thanks that I speak in tongues more than you all, 

19|but putting that to the side, when I’m in a church I want to speak five words or so 
using my mind so that I would pass on instruction to others, rather than a million 
words in an unknown language.
          
20|Comrades, don’t become children in your thought processes, but instead, 
act like toddlers with the evil you’re inundated with and become adults in your thought 
processes. 
21|It’s written in the Old Testament[l]:

“In different tongues
And by the lips of different people
I will speak to this folk,
And they won’t even hear and obey Me
As I speak in this way,” says the Lord


22|This is the case so much so that the tongues referred to by this Old Testament 
passage are intended to be a sign (i.e., a miracle God performed, done in such a way to 
demonstrate beyond any doubt that He did it) not to those who believe but rather to 
those who refuse to believe[C]. 
23|So if the entire church were to gather together in 
one place and everyone were to speak in tongues and a person who isn’t versed in the 
things of the Spirit or speak in tongues or an unbeliever were to enter, they’d come to 
the conclusion that you all are insane, wouldn’t they? 
24|But if everyone were to 
prophecy and some unbeliever or someone who’s not versed in the Spirit were to enter, 
everything inside of him will be exposed by everyone, he’ll be examined by everyone, 

25|the secrets of his heart will get to where they’re out in the open for everyone to 
see, so that he’ll worship God as he falls on his face, telling everyone that God really is 
among you.
          
26|What’s the bottom line[m], comrades? When you get together as a group, 
each has a hymn, each has a teaching, each has a revelation, each has a message in tongues, 
each has an interpretation of a message in tongues. Let everything that happens serve the 
purpose of edification— 
27|Should someone speak in tongues, let there be two or at 
the most three messages given at a time one after the other and let one person interpret 
each message.[D] 
28|Now if there’s no interpreter, have him remain silent in church, 
but let him speak in tongues to himself and to God[E].
          
29|Let a handful[n] of prophets speak, and let the others go through what they 
prophesy and judge it piece by piece. 
30|Now if something were to be revealed to 
another person seated nearby or in the congregation, have the first one silence himself. 

31|The fact is all of you can prophecy one after another, so that everyone would 
learn and be exhorted, comforted, counseled, and advised; 
32|the spirits of 
prophets are subordinate to and take directions from prophets.[F] 
33|You see, God 
is not a product of confusion but of peace.
      As in all the congregations of those who believe in Christ, 
34|have the 
women in the churches keep silent. The fact of the matter is, I don’t allow them to speak 
aloud addressing the entire congregation[G], but have them submit instead, just as the Old 
Testament concurs. 
35|If they want to learn something in particular, let them ask 
their husbands at home; it’s disgraceful for a woman to speak aloud in a disrupting way 
in church you see— 
36|Or did the word of God issue forth from you? Or are you 
the only ones it came down and met[o]?
          
37|If someone is considered to be a prophet or spiritual (i.e., the Holy Spirit 
manifests spiritual gifts through him), let him come to recognize and understand that 
what I’m writing to you is a commandment from the Lord. 
38|But if someone will 
not understand, let him remain without understanding. 
39|So then, my comrades, 
seek to prophesy and prophesy and to speak and speak in tongues, not preventing 
speaking in tongues— 
*[a]by his spirit…Or: with the Spirit…Lit: by [or in; with] [the] spirit.
*[b]more important…Lit: greater
*[c]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[d]proceed to speak…Lit: speaking
*[e]a revelation, a knowledge, a prophecy, or a teaching…The Gk. wording insinuates that this is a 
comprehensive list
*[f]whether we’re talking about a flute or a harp…The usage of the Gk. word for whether in this verse 
implies that Paul’s referring to the flute or the harp only to the exclusion of all other instruments. Ref. 
note of Rev. 18:22
*[g]wasting your breath…Lit: speaking to air
*[h]a person from another country who can’t speak the native language…Lit: a barbarian
*[i]be involved in the production of the words…Lit: is unfruitful
*[j]in the Spirit…Or: with the spirit. Some ambiguity exists.
*[k]Your Blessing…The Gk. construct insinuates that the message is the speaker’s own peculiar message
*[l]the Old Testament…Lit: the Law
*[m]what’s the bottom line…Lit: so what is
*[n]a handful…Lit: two or three. An expression; also used in Matt. 18:20.
*[o]are you the only ones it came down and met…Also: to you only it arrived

*[A]sing a song…Lit: to pluck [the strings of a musical instrument like a harp; to play a stringed instrument; 
to sing to the music of a harp]. Weak as it may be, this is one of the few pieces of evidence in the Bible 
of post-resurrection believers using musical instruments in worship.
*[B]a person who isn’t versed in the things of the Spirit and doesn’t speak in tongues…Lit: the one filling up 
the place of the outsider. The phrase the one filling up the place is an expression, and what deeper 
meaning or further nuance that this expression communicates, I don’t know . The Gk. word for outsider 
is contingent on the context. Given a skill, profession, or some area of knowledge, the “outsider” is a 
novice, is unskilled, or is ignorant when it comes to the matter at hand.
*[C]This is the case so much so that the tongues referred to by this Old Testament passage are intended to 
be a sign (i.e., a miracle God performed, done in such a way to demonstrate beyond any doubt that He 
did it) not to those who believe but rather to those who refuse to believe…Lit: so much so that the 
tongues are intended to be a sign not to those who believer but rather to those [in] unbelief. A puzzling 
verse. J.B. Phillips, author of The New Testament in Modern English (1958 version), wrote, “This is the 
sole instance of the translator’s departing from the accepted text. He felt bound to conclude, from the 
sense of the next three verses, that we have here either a slip of the pen on the part of Paul, or, more 
probably, a copyist’s error.” In other words, Phillips is justifying the fact that he swapped a couple words 
to make sense of this verse. I disagree with Phillips; however, this verse must be supplied with 
interpolations to make sense of it. Verse 22 begins with the Gk. word hōste [so much so (ὥστε/Strong’s 
5620)]. Hōste connects two thoughts, and an interpolation has been added to beginning of the verse to 
make this more apparent (Matt. 12:12 is an example). Verse 22 is tightly coupled with v. 21, being linked 
to the quotation from Is. 28:11–12. What this means is that tongues is a sign that the prophecy from 
Isaiah has been fulfilled, so that those who don’t believe should recognize it as the fulfillment of this 
prophecy.
*[D]Should someone speak in tongues, let there be two or at the most three messages given at a time one 
after the other and let one person interpret each message…As Paul left a few key words to one’s 
imagination, it’s not quite clear which of a couple different things he meant. It seems that these verses 
here are referring to one person speaking, as the words someone in should someone speak; him in let 
him remain silent; and him in let him speak to himself are all singular.
*[E]let him speak in tongues to himself and to God…Lit: let him speak to himself and to God. The 
interpolation in tongues is justifiable based on the context and is affirmed by v. 2, which says that a 
person who speaks in tongues speaks to God. Many have taken the first half of v. 28, “Now if there’s no 
interpreter, have him remain silent in church,” to mean that there should be no speaking in tongues in 
church whatsoever unaccompanied by an interpretation. For this reason, Paul added the second half of 
v. 28 to allow speaking in tongues done without interpretation, as long as it’s done quietly (i.e. to 
himself).
Many claim that the Bible commands that all speaking in tongues must be followed by an interpretation, 
but there’s not a single example of a message in tongues followed by an interpretation when one closely 
examines every instance of speaking in tongues in Acts. In fact, in each of those instances, not only was 
there no interpretation given, but everyone was speaking in tongues at the same time. None of those 
who were speaking in tongues in Acts are “outsiders” (see above note), so it’s alright for them all to 
speak in tongues at the same time since they’ll all be self-edified.
Furthermore, as v. 28 says “…have him remain silent in church…” but also says “…let him speak to 
himself and to God,” we should infer that what Paul meant by “remain silent in the church” is actually a 
command to not speak in a loud voice so as to address the congregation rather than a command to not 
speak at all—otherwise, how can such a person simultaneously remain silent and speak to himself? This 
observation gains importance later on in this chapter when Paul talks about women keeping silent in 
church. The same applies in that case for women: he’s not saying that women can’t talk at all in church, 
rather he’s saying women shouldn’t talk out loud in a way that they address the entire congregation. 
This observation makes sense, as the problem in the Corinthian church was multiple parties trying to 
speak to the entire congregation at the same time, talking over top of each other—one speaking to 
himself or speaking in a subdued voice was not the problem.
*[F]the spirits of prophets are subordinate to and take directions from prophets…Regardless of whether 
prophets have been given the unction from the Holy Spirit to prophecy, the may choose not to, and this 
is not a slight against the Holy Spirit. This passage insinuates that a prophet will receive such unction but 
will have to wait his turn to deliver it. Put another way, the Holy Spirit will at times give unctions to 
multiple people at the same time, but it’s up to them to deliver these messages serially. An unction from 
the Holy Spirit can be held for a period of time—it doesn’t have to be blurted out the moment it’s 
received.
[G]to speak aloud addressing the entire congregation…Lit: to speak. Ref. note of v. 27 for justification for 
adding aloud addressing the entire congregation. Paul is not forbidding women to engage in normal 
conversation while at church; that notion is preposterous.
Continuing on in vv. 35–36, Paul says it’s disgraceful for a woman to speak in church. Paul’s statement 
“If they want to learn something in particular, let them ask their husbands at home” implies that the 
women were disrupting the entire church by interrupting the speaker with a question. Not only were 
they interrupting the speaker, Paul’s remark, “did the word of God issue forth from you (etc),” indicates 
that their questions did not come from a sincere, humble desire to learn but from a position of 
arrogance, from a know-it-all attitude. These reasons are why Paul said it was disgraceful for the women 
(these women) to speak in church.
But we know that women were permitted to speak in church at that time, since Acts 21:9 mentions four 
young women who prophesied. In order to prophesy, these women would have to do so in a church 
setting, and doing so meant that they were addressing the congregation while prophesying. This 
fourteenth chapter plus the ancient treatise called the Didache indicate that the first century church had 
prophets stand up and address the congregation in prophesies on a regular basis—something which is 
radically different than even what Pentecostals do nowadays. I imagine that the four daughters of Acts 
21:9 took their turn at the pulpit.

1 Cor.
40|But let everything be done properly and orderly.


&COR1 15
1|I’m making you understand, comrades[a], the Gospel (i.e., the good-news 
message) which was evangelized to you, which in addition you received (i.e., took hold 
of in your hearts and applied to your own selves), and in which you stand (i.e., in this 
you are established, you remain stable and steadfast, and in this you withstand the 
pressures of life), 
2|and through which you are being saved (i.e., time after time being 
rescued from life’s calamities) by some concept[b] evangelized to you if you keep a tight 
grip on what you received, unless of course you weren’t serious when you made the 
decision to believe (i.e., you frivolously, heedlessly, inconsiderately, without purpose, 
without just cause, without careful thought, without due consideration, or haphazardly 
made the decision).
          
3|You see, I gave the highest priority to putting into you what I too received, 
namely that Christ died on behalf of us sinners according to the Scriptures, 
4|that he 
was buried, that he rose on the Third Day, 
5|and that he was seen by Peter[c], and then 
after that by the twelve disciples. 
6|After that he was seen by over five-hundred people 
at the same time, the majority of whom have stayed alive until now, but some of them 
have passed away[d]. 
7|After that, he was seen by James and then by all of the 
apostles. 
8|Last of all he was seen by me too, the bastard-stepchild[e] sort of.
          
9|You see, I am the most insignificant of the apostles, one who is not worthy 
enough to be called an apostle because I persecuted God’s church. 
10|By the grace 
of God I am what I am, but His grace wasn’t wasted on me; instead I worked harder 
than all of them, not me personally but rather the grace of God in conjunction with me. 

11|So whether I’m the one doing the preaching or those other apostles are the ones doing 
it, we preach this same message in the same fashion, and you believed this same 
message in the same fashion[f].
          
12|Now if the belief that Christ was raised from the dead is being preached, 
how is it that certain individuals among you claim that there is no resurrection from the 
dead[g] (i.e., once a person dies, his total existence ceases; there is no life after death, nor 
can a person return from the dead since the moment he dies he ceases to exist)? 

13|If there’s no resurrection from the dead, not even Christ has been raised from 
the dead. 
14|If Christ hasn’t been raised, then our preaching of Christ is a waste of 
time and your faith is a waste of time— 
15|And it’ll be obvious to everyone that we 
lie under oath, since we swore by God under oath that He raised Christ—whom He 
didn’t raise—from the dead, since the dead supposedly aren’t raised. 
16|You see, if the 
dead aren’t raised, not even Christ has been raised. 
17|But if Christ hasn’t been 
raised, your faith is pointless; you are still trapped in your sins— 
18|and those 
who’ve passed away in Christ have perished too. 
19|If we who in this life have 
hoped in Christ have been stranded[h], we are the most pathetic people of all.
          
20|But it turns out that Christ has been raised from the dead, a premier[i] of 
those who’ve passed away. 
21|You see, since death came through a single, specific 
person, resurrection from the dead (i.e., hope of existing after death; life after death; 
blissful existence in the afterlife) also came through a single, specific person. 
22|To 
this point, just as everyone died (i.e., died spiritually: underwent a stagnation of waste, 
joylessness, futility, and destruction; eventually died physically) by means of Adam, 
likewise everyone in Christ shall be made alive by means of Christ too. 
23|But the 
resurrection will occur by each person’s ranking: Christ the premier first, then after him 
those who are affiliated with Christ will be resurrected at his coming, 
24|then comes 
the End, when the kingdom of God the Father[j] will be transferred into his hands, 
entrusted to him for him to do as he wills, when He’ll abolish every ruler, every 
authority, and every power[A]; 
25|you see, it’s absolutely necessary[k] that he reign 
and reign until such a time that all of his enemies be put under his feet (i.e., all his 
enemies be subjected to him: totally subdued and under his absolute control). 

26|Death will be the last enemy to be destroyed; 
27|you see, it’s written, “He 
put all things under his feet.” When the circumstances arise in which He happens to say 
“all things have been subjected[l],” it goes without saying that the Father’s not included 
in the “all things.” 
28|But when those circumstances arise when He subjects all 
things to him, then in addition the son himself will be subjected to the One Who 
subjected all things to him, so that God would become every little piece of everything[m].
          
29|But if all this is not the case, what are they going to do, they who are 
getting themselves baptized as a symbol of their resurrection from the dead[B]? If the 
dead are definitely not resurrected, why are they being baptized as a symbol of them 
not being dead? 
30|Why do we take risks with our lives every moment? 
31|Day 
after day I die by the lofty oath sworn to look after you, comrades, which I keep in 
Christ Jesus our Lord.[n] 
32|That I had my back against the wall and was fighting 
for my life[o] in Ephesus, what’s the point of doing it all if the dead aren’t resurrected. 
Wouldn’t we be better off doing what Isaiah said?—

Let us eat and drink[p] and live it up,
For tomorrow we shall die


33|Don’t be fooled into believing that; realize this instead:

The wrong crowd corrupts good conduct


34|Snap out of it and don’t continue in sin. In fact, some of you don’t have a 
knowing, recognition, or understanding of God. Shame on you[q].
          
35|Moving on though, someone’s bound to say[r], “How will the dead be 
resurrected (i.e., how’s it possible for a dead person to obtain a new body)?” What kind 
of body will they get in the afterlife? 
36|How brainless you are! What someone sows 
doesn’t spring to life unless it happens to die, 
37|and what one sows isn’t the body 
(i.e., the same biological form) of what it will become. No—you sow a bare 
seed…perhaps it’s wheat…perhaps it’s some other grain… 
38|But God gives it a 
body (i.e., a plant form) the way He wanted and gives a unique, peculiar body to each 
type of seed sown. 
39|Not all flesh (i.e., cell and tissue composition) is the same 
flesh (i.e., consists of the same kind of tissues, skeleton, muscle, skin, etc.). No—there’s 
one type of flesh which corresponds to humans, another type of flesh which corresponds 
to farm animals, another type of flesh to birds, another type of flesh to fish. 
40|There 
are bodies (i.e., unique physical entities) in outer-space[s] and bodies on Earth, but no, 
they’re not the same: there’s one type of glory (i.e., wonder, splendor, awe, something 
spectacular) for the entities in space vs. another type of glory for the entities on Earth; 

41|the uniqueness of glory that the sun has is a different glory than the type that 
the moon has, and there’s a different, unique type for the stars too: in fact one star 
differs in its glory from that of another star.
          
42|The resurrection from the dead works the same way. The body which is 
sown is a mortal, decaying body tainted with moral corruption; it’s resurrected an 
immortal, non-decayable body untainted by moral corruption. 
43|It’s sown in 
dishonor, it’s resurrected in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power; 
44|sown a 
soul-body (i.e., a body having all the quintessential human elements: one that has a 
thirst for the things of this life, that thinks and feels as humans do, has human frailties), 
raised a spiritual-body. If it is a soul-body, it is also a spiritual-body: 
45|this is also 
the way it’s written in the Old Testament,

The first man Adam became[t] a living-soul

…The Last Adam became a sprung-to-life-spirit. 
46|No, the first Adam wasn’t the 
spiritual-body prototype-man rather the soul-body prototype-man, then came the spiritual-
body prototype-man. 
47|The first man came out of the earth’s dirt, the second man 
came out of the spiritual world[u]. 
48|As the dirt is, so too are the dirt-creations; as 
the spiritual world is, so too are the spiritual-creations. 
49|And just as we bore the 
image of the dirt, let us bear the image of the spiritual as well.
          
50|I’ll say this, comrades, that flesh and blood[v] (i.e., the best that human 
ability can muster) cannot inherit the kingdom of God (i.e., cannot put you in a place 
where you have a relationship with God; where God works in and through your life); 
neither does decayable mortality tainted with moral corruption inherit non-decayable 
immortality untainted by moral corruption.
          
51|Hey—I’ll tell you a mystery: we all shall not sleep (i.e., stay dead 
forever), but we all shall be changed 
52|in a split-second, in the time it takes to 
blink an eye, at the last bugle call: the bugle shall sound off, and the dead will be raised 
and become non-decayable immortals untainted by moral corruption. Yes, we ourselves 
shall be changed. 
53|You see, this decayable mortality must put on non-decayable 
immortality, and this mortal nature must put on an immortal nature. 
54|When this 
decayable mortality shall have put on non-decayable immortality, and this mortal 
nature shall have put on an immortal nature, then the verses will come to pass which 
say,

Death is engulfed by victory.


55|Death, where is your victory?
Death, where is your sting[w]?


56|The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law (i.e., the Law of Moses; 
the set of commandments given by God)— 
57|But thank-you God, Who gives us 
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

*[A]every ruler, every authority, and every power…An explanation of the Gk. words for positions of 
authority and the like. The first three correspond to what’s quoted here:
Ruler [archōn, (ἄρχων/Strong’s 758)]—When referring to people, the very top of a hierarchy; the one 
who has the ultimate power over the entire hierarchy. It refers to a person or the people who are at the 
top of the pyramid, whatever that pyramid may be. It’s translated principalities in Eph. 6:12 (KJV), and in 
that case does not refer to people but refers to demons, demons who are at the top of some demonic 
hierarchy. When referring to time, it’s the very start or beginning of an epoch of time, sometimes 
spoken of abstractly when the start of time isn’t known (John 1:1). The KJV translates this as prince 
instead of the NASB’s ruler in places such as John 16:11, etc. See below for more on prince.
Authority [eksousia, (ἐξουσία/Strong’s 1849)]—The literal meaning is existing out of. Power which is 
given to a person to act on behalf of a hierarchy, government, etc. which has the ultimate power. Also, 
one who’s given the legitimate right to exercise power. Also, the power itself, with the understanding 
that it was granted in such a way and not simply usurped; the position, the seat itself.
Power [dunamis, (δύναμις/Strong’s 1411)]—The natural, inherent capability to exercise control over 
others. The ability may or may not be legitimate or have been granted by the government or hierarchy. 
The word power simply states the capability to exercise power, but does not specify where this ability 
comes from, whether the power is transferrable, or what the nature of it is; whereas the word authority, 
while in certain contexts simply refers to power, is, in its essence, power which is derived from the main 
body; power delegated; legitimate power; non-usurped power. Therefore, dunamis may refer to 
usurped power or illegitimate power.
Leader [haegemon, (ἡγεμών/Strong’s 2232)]—This has two similar meanings. First is the Latin dux: it’s 
the one who’s the leader; who takes charge and leads the way for others to follow; the commander, the 
one who not only makes the decisions everyone follows but is responsible for those decisions, whom 
everyone relies on to ensure that the decisions are intelligently made. The second is the Latin princeps: 
the one who does a thing first. The princeps is the person who’s the most eminent, most distinguished, 
the first person; the leading citizen of the country; the person who’s the best at something and 
therefore has taken the lead; the person everyone relies on the most to lead the way when facing 
difficulties. In modern terms, the captain of a sports team is a princeps: the best player, and as the best 
takes the initiative the most, and as a result of taking the initiative, he’s the one who leads and drives 
the others to victory.
Dominion [kuriotās, (κυριότης/Strong’s 2963)]—The literal meaning is the nature of lordship. It is “the 
majestic power that a lord wields, ruling power, lordship, dominion” (Danker & Bauer). The nature of 
lordship is the assumption that the expected order of things is for there to be a lord and that this lord 
will rule over others, and that there are guidelines by which this is done, either codified in law or in an 
unspoken understanding. As this word is derived from lord, it follows that it refers to the powers a lord 
has and the way that he obtained them. Unlike the word authority, a lord is not a ruler who derives his 
power from the government, but rather is like the owner of a large private estate, say, somewhere out 
in a remote rural area. In a feudal system this would include a dukedom or earldom, but a lordship can 
be much smaller also. Those who live in remote, rural areas are in many respects autonomous from the 
rest of society, including the government. While the lord rules like an authority (eksousia), his sphere of 
power doesn’t fall under the authority to another, so within his sphere he’s not answerable to anyone 
else. As expected, this also refers to a lordship seat which is transferrable, like from father to son, etc.
Throne[(thronos, (θρόνος/Strong’s 2362)]—A ruler whose powers extend to sitting on a judgment seat: 
arbitrating disputes, acting as a judge in a civil or criminal proceeding; receiving emissaries; forming 
policy, including do so with the advice of a counsel. The throne is not an ad-hoc judgment seat, but is a 
persistent seat, passed from person to person. As is apparent, there’s overlap in these terms for rulers.
Pastor/shepherd [poimān, (ποιμήν/Strong’s 4166)]—(Ref. note of 1 Pet. 5:2). This Old Testament word 
means leader, but the implication is that this person is leading ordinary people (sheep) and not soldiers 
under his chain of command. The sheep-analogy means that such a leader will have to deal with 
problems that are eradicated in an army due to the discipline instilled into that army. The problems 
Moses had to deal with when leading Israel in the wilderness are analogous to a shepherd over sheep. 
Since poimān has its roots in the Old Testament, the word is only used in conjunction with ecclesiastical 
leadership.
To come forward as a leader [proistāmi,(προΐστημι/Strong’s 4291)]—This appears in the NT as a verb 
but is also used substantively as a noun. It literally means to stand forward, and appears in Rom. 12:8; 1 
Thess. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17. Danker & Bauer defines it first, “to exercise a position of leadership, rule direct, 
be at the head of,” and second, “to have an interest in, show concern for, care for, give aid.” There are 
only three occurrences in the NT and all are in relation to church leadership. 
Steward [oikonomos, (οἰκονόμος/Strong’s 3623)]—Someone whom a lord (the ruler of a sizeable estate) 
puts in charge of the affairs of the estate. Luke 12:42; 16:1; Titus 1:7 are examples.
Overseer, bishop [episkopos, (ἐπίσκοπος/Strong’s 1985)]—The Gk. word means “one who visits,” more 
specifically, “one who checks up on things to ensure that things are in order”; hence the NASB rendering 
episkopos as overseer. What we nowadays call a “head pastor.” Someone who’s the single individual 
who’s the head over a congregation. This position didn’t exist in the early days of the church, as the 
early church was ruled by elder councils, probably imitating the way that synagogues were ruled by 
elders. Apparently, as Christianity diverged more and more from Judaism, the forms of church 
government diverged as well, with churches replacing elder councils with bishops. 
Deacon [diakonos, (διάκονος/Strong’s 1249)]—A deacon is a leader (a poiman) in the church who has 
oversight over a specific area in the church, but does not have total oversight like a bishop does. 
Deacons existed in both elder-ruled and bishop-ruled churches. Nowadays, we call a deacon an 
associate pastor or a ministry director. A deacon is similar to a steward (see how these two words are 
used together in Col 1:25) but applied to a church context, as the word’s used in the NT. Deacon appears 
in Rom. 12:7; 1 Cor. 16:15; Eph. 6:21; 1 Tim 3:10.
Slave or servant [doulos, (δοῦλος/Strong’s 1401)]—This word is translated either servant or slave. As 
slavery was pervasive in the ancient world, most of the times a doulos is a slave, but since the slavery-
mindset is absent from us in modern times, we must make distinctions in this word. This word means a 
servant, a menial servant, one who takes orders and is not entrusted with any significant 
responsibilities. This word means a slave, someone who’s owned by another person; someone who’s 
locked into this position; forced servitude. Doulos as appears in the NT can refer to one or multiple of 
these definitions, and the most appropriate rendering is dictated by context. In the NT, a doulos can be a 
menial servant without specifically or explicitly referring to someone who’s locked into slavery, i.e. 
owned by another person. In this respect, a person who’s “locked into” a nine-to-five job is a doulos of a 
sort, even though he’s not a bona fide slave.

[B]they who are getting themselves baptized as a symbol of their resurrection from the dead…Lit: being 
baptized [or getting themselves baptized] on behalf of the dead. Translators and commentators are 
puzzled at the meaning of this. Some guess-work is required. A good explanation from one of the 
commentators is that an interpolation was intended, one which changes the dead to the resurrection of 
the dead. Also, the prepositional phrase usually translated on behalf of has been bent from its 
traditional meaning to mean something that symbolizes something else. Also, the verb to baptize seems 
to acquire some middle voice usage, but that’s speculative. Those who disagree with these 
explanations—and there are several good reasons to do so—are welcome to explain how their 
interpretation makes better sense.

58|So then, my dear comrades, get to where you’re[x] unshakeable, un-
moveable, and un-perturbable, abounding and proliferating in the Lord’s work at all 
times, knowing for certain that your work in the Lord is not for nothing, is not going to 
waste.


&COR1 16
1|Concerning the matter of taking up a collection for the poor and sending it to 
God’s people[a] in Jerusalem, do the same thing that I commanded the churches in Galatia 
to do: 
2|Let each of you in private stash away a bit of your money every Sunday[b]—
whatever you can afford—so that when I come, there won’t be any collection-taking 
going on then. 
3|When I make it over to your place, whomever you happen to decide 
upon to write letters of recommendation for, I’ll dispatch as couriers to take your gift to 
Jerusalem. 
4|If there happens to be an issue of respect[A], they’ll come with me when I 
depart.
          
5|I’ll come your way when I pass through Macedonia; I’ll be passing through 
Macedonia, you see. 
6|Perhaps I’ll stay with you a while or even spend the winter, so 
that you’ll send me on my way refreshed and prepared for the journey[B] wherever I happen 
to go; 
7|you see, at the moment I don’t want to just stop by for a short visit while 
passing through the area; you see, I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits. 

8|I’ll stay in Ephesus until Pentecost (i.e., until late May to early June). 
9|In fact, a 
great door (i.e., a tremendous opportunity) has been opened for me and it looks 
promising, but I’ll have to face many adversaries.
          
10|If Timothy happens to show up, see to it that he doesn’t get to where he’s 
intimidated by you[c]; he’s doing the Lord’s work like I’m doing, you see, 
11|so 
don’t let anyone treat him disrespectfully or despise him. Send him forth to his next 
destination in peace (i.e., take care of him, treat him well, and send him out prepared 
for the journey), so that he manages to come to me, for I expect him with the group of 
comrades[d] who’ll be coming.
          
12|Concerning Comrade Apollos…I’ve encouraged him an awful lot to pay 
you a visit, doing so by travelling with the comrades who’ll be coming, and it wasn’t his 
desire altogether to go at this time, but he’ll go in good time.
          
13|Stay focused[e], take a firm stand in the faith, man up, seize control and 
hold on tightly. 
14|Let everything you do manifest itself in love.
          
15|I appeal to you, comrades…you know first-hand Stephanas’s household, 
since they’re the crème de la crème of the converts[f] of Achaia and have been put in 
positions of deacons for God’s people, the saints…
16|I appeal to you that you too 
would submit to such fine individuals as these and to all the fellow-workers and laborers. 

17|I’m so glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus showed up, that these 
fellows filled in the pieces that you’re missing[g]: 
18|they gave rest to my spirit and 
to yours, so recognize the character and contribution of men such as these.
          
19|The churches in the Roman province of Asia send their greetings to you. 
Aquila and Priscilla send many greetings to you in the Lord and are joined in their 
greetings with the group of Christians who meet in their house. 
20|All the 
comrades greet you. Give each other a hearty handshake and an affectionate hug—holy 
ones—for me.[h]
          
21|The greeting written here is in my own handwriting, that of Paul’s. 

22|If anyone doesn’t like the Lord a lot[i], let him be accursed. Maranatha (Do come 
Lord).
          
23|The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you all. 
*[a]God’s people…Lit: saints
*[b]Sunday…Lit: first of the Sabbath. As they didn’t have names for the days of the weeks, they referred to 
each day by how many days past the Sabbath it is.
*[c]doesn’t get to where he’s intimidated by you…Lit: will be fearless towards you
*[d]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[e]stay focused…Lit: watch
*[f]crème de la crème of the converts…Lit: a first-fruit. Ref. note of Rom. 8:23.
*[g]filled in the pieces that you’re missing…Lit: filled up your lack
*[h]Give each other a hearty handshake and an affectionate hug—holy ones—for me…Lit: Greet each with 
a holy kiss. Liberties taken.
*[i]like the Lord a lot…Lit: love [phileo] the Lord. Note the Gk. word phileō (φιλέω/Strong’s 5368) is used 
and not agapaō (ἀγαπάω/Strong’s 25). Ref. note of Matt. 10:37.

*[A]an issue of respect …Lit: worthy. Same word used similarly in Rom. 16:2. Guessing that Paul was 
referring to the respect the Jewish believers in Jerusalem would give to Gentile couriers—although this 
is very much a guess on my part.
[B]send me on my way refreshed and prepared for the journey…Lit: send me forth. Based on the usage in 
the NT of the Gk. word for forth-send (Acts. 15:3, 20:38, 21:5; Rom. 15:24; 1 Cor. 16:11; 2 Cor. 1:16; 
Titus 3:13; 3 John 1:6), the word appears to have an meaning beyond what its roots suggest of simply 
sending someone forth. Additionally, it appears to mean, “sending someone on a journey prepared for 
that journey; sending someone away one good terms after they’ve spent a long with you; sending 
someone away with sorrow at seeing them go, with gladness of the work they’ll do; sending someone 
out to accomplish a mission; sending someone with your support and blessings; recommending a person 
sent to the next party which will receive him.”


2 Corinthians
       If it wasn’t enough that Paul wrote his longest epistle (slightly longer than Romans by verse 
count), he writes a second—and not a short one either. How did the Corinthians merit two lengthy 
epistles, whereas the Ephesians or Philippians did not?
       And based on what Paul wrote in the first letter, does the second show any signs that the 
Corinthians improved? Is the second epistle a part II of the first? No, the tone that the letter begins in is 
completely different, as Paul repeatedly uses words like suffering, tribulation, and consolation in the 
first chapter. The second chapter finds Paul expressing sorrow; the sting from the first letter is apparent. 
Is the sting mutual, as the second epistles describes the anguish, sorrow, and even tears Paul underwent 
as he penned the first? But the end of the book is telling: Paul says “the more I love you, the less I’m 
loved” (12:15).
        Of all the churches Paul founded, the Corinthian was not the most spiritual, but as it is true of a 
parent of several children whose favorite child is not the one who’s the best behaved, so it is with Paul 
and the Corinthians, as the volume he wrote to this church, the extremes of emotion, surpass the other 
churches.
       In the first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul gives a hint here, a detail there, of the difficulties he 
faces. But in this second epistle, as Paul progresses through the letter, his allusions become sentences, 
then the sentences become paragraphs. This culminates in the twelfth chapter as he talks about his 
“thorn in the flesh”—an oft misinterpreted passage.
       The Greek text is from one who has full command of the language, unlike the Gospels or like 
John’s writing. The writer was educated, the recipients were as well. Many times a more uncommon 
word was chosen when a simple word would have sufficed. But there is none of the awkwardness one 
finds, for example, in James or in the Gospels. The writing is fluid, howbeit with words and phrases 
omitted for brevity, like one does when texting on a phone. This is one of the more challenging NT books 
translate, ranking alongside Jude, but that also makes it one of the most satisfying.

24|May my love be with 
all of you in Christ Jesus.


&COR2 1
1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and his fellow comrade[a] 
Timothy—
      To the church of God that is in Corinth, joined by the saints (i.e., God’s people) 
who are all over Achaia:
          
2|Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
3|Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Originator[b] of 
all sorts of[c] compassion and of advice, encouragement, and consolation, 
4|which 
consoles, etc. us in all of our distresses[d], resulting in our ability to console those in all 
kinds of distresses with the same consolation with which we’re being consoled by God. 

5|Just as Christ’s sufferings proliferate to us, in the same way through Christ the 
consolation we receive proliferates as well. 
6|Whether we’re being pressured, it’s for 
the sake of your consolation and salvation (i.e., your being rescued from spiritual, 
moral, mental, and physical calamity); whether we’re being consoled, it’s for the sake of 
your consolation, a consolation which is accomplished by enduring the same sufferings 
which we too suffer. 
7|And the hope which we have for you—our hope is firm, fixed 
in the observation that as you are joint participants of the sufferings which we suffer, in 
the same way you are joint participants of the consolation as well.
          
8|In this regard, we don’t want you to be left in the dark, comrades, about the 
extreme difficulties we experienced in the Roman province of Asia, that we were 
overloaded and overwhelmed to the point that we lost the will to live. 
9|Anyways, 
deep inside ourselves we concluded that we were doomed to die[e], so we reached the 
point where we couldn’t be convinced that our own abilities would save us, but were 
convinced that the God who raises the dead would do so instead: 
10|He Who rescued 
us from a narrow brush with death[f]—and rescues us continuously—we set our hope in 
Him that He’ll rescue us yet again, 
11|while you too were joining in lending a 
helping hand by the prayers that you prayed for us, so that the outcome of the stances, 
disposition, and full attention of many people[g] is that the mercy and kindness shown 
to us would be thanked by many on our behalf.
          
12|You see, our proud talk and bold claims[h] are on par with the solemn 
declaration of our conscience, since the lifestyle we led in the world (i.e., among those 
who aren’t believers) was by God’s simplicity and sincerity, not by the wisdom of flesh 
(i.e., by the cunning shrewdness of our own ability apart from God tainted by the carnal 
nature) but by God’s grace instead—and that lifestyle was all the more so with you. 

13|In fact we’re writing to you nothing other than what you’re reading to the 
congregation or what you’re coming to understand, but I hope that you continue to gain 
an exact understanding until it’s all said and done[i], 
14|just as you also gained an 
understanding of us, at least partially, that we are the reason for your proud talk and 
bold claims just as you too will be ours in the Day of the Lord Jesus (i.e., when he’s 
revealed in the fullness of his might).
          
15|We formed a long-term desire for this, for what we’ve reached the point 
where we’re convinced is the thing that we want to do more than anything else, namely 
to go visit you, so that you would get a second grace (i.e., a second impartation of our 
face-to-face ministry), 
16|and to continue on our journey through your city to 
Macedonia, to resume the journey going from Macedonia back to your city again, and to 
be sent forth by you (i.e., depart fully rested, provisioned, and in good spirits—all on 
account of the your generosity and hospitality) to the Jews in Judea.
          
17|So then, was this plan treated with a nonchalant thought-process? Or 
what I’m planning, I’m planning according to flesh (i.e., from my own self apart from 
God, according to my own needs, and somewhat tainted to feed my carnal appetite), so 
that it would be “the yes-yes and the no-no” with me (i.e., I’d vacillate or renege on 
what I planned or promised to do)? 
18|But—by God—trust me[j] that the 
statements we made to you aren’t “the yes-yes and the no-no.” 
19|To this point, 
God’s son Jesus Christ, who through us has been preached among you—through me, 
Siloam, and Timothy—hasn’t wound up being “the yes-yes and the no-no,” but rather 
has wound up being “yes” in him. 
20|For as many promises as there are from God, 
in him they are all “yes” (i.e., no vacillating or reneging on them), and in light of this 
through him is also the Amen (i.e., the acknowledgement of the finality of a matter; the 
familiar profession to God of “Let it be so”) to God with glory through us. 

21|God’s establishing us together with you in Christ and anointed us. 
22|He 
also stamped us with His seal of approval[A] and gave us the down payment[B] of the 
Spirit in our hearts.
          
23|I swear to God—cross my heart and hope to die[k]—that it was to spare 
you that I no longer went to Corinth— 
*[a]comrade…Lit: brother
*[b]Originator…Lit: Father. This has a dual meaning: both God the Father and Someone who creates.
*[c]all sorts of…Lit: all. A figure of speech. Use of the word all figuratively also occurs 1 Tim. 6:10.
*[d]distresses…Also: tribulations; extremely difficult circumstances
*[e]we concluded that we were doomed to die…Lit: we had the sentence [or diagnosis] of death. Appears 
to be an expression or idiom.
*[f]from a narrow brush with death…Lit: out of a great death. Appears to be an expression.
*[g]the outcome of the stances, disposition, and full attention of many people…Lit: out of many faces
*[h]proud talk and bold claims…Lit: boasting
*[i]until it’s all said and done…Lit: until [the] end
*[j]by God—trust me…Lit: God [be] faithful. This appears to be an idiom.
*[k]I swear to God—cross my heart and hope to die…Lit: I call upon witness-God upon my soul. Some 
liberties taken.
*[l]work together as helpers…Lit: fellow workers

*[A]stamped us with His seal of approval…Lit: sealed us. Seals were used in ancient times the same way 
they are today, howbeit for the occasional different application. A messenger who was assigned the task 
of delivering a papyrus scroll with a message written on it to a remote destination was handed a scroll 
which was sealed. The sealing more than likely was a hot wax dripped across the overlapping edges of 
the scroll, so that when the wax cooled and hardened, the scroll couldn’t be opened and read without 
irreparably breaking the wax seal—similar to how an envelope, once opened, cannot be closed again 
and how, if it was opened, it would be apparent. In addition, the wax, while still hot, was stamped with a 
stamp or a signet ring which had a detailed image etched into it which became imprinted into the wax, 
so that the cooled wax retained this image. The receiver would inspect the image to make sure it was 
genuine, as only a limited set of stamps or signet rings would be made. The receiver would be ensured 
that the document was genuine, not a forgery from an imposter, as a potential imposter, though 
capable of writing a forgery, could not (at least easily) make a duplicate of the stamp or signet ring.
So now, as Paul uses the word seal a few times in his epistles, what he’s referring to is this:
1. God has placed his stamp of approval on something
2. The thing God stamped is genuine, valuable, and special
3. Any third party, someone other than God the stamper and the person being sealed, upon 
examination will be able to recognize that such a stamp is indeed from God
[B]down payment…Also: collateral…Lit: surety; pledge. As seen in the OT (one example is Prov. 6:1–5), 
loans were secured with collateral, so a person who needed to borrow a small amount of cash for a day 
or two could leave his cloak with the person who lends him the money as collateral. Now on a few 
occasions Paul in his epistles states that the Holy Spirit is given to us like collateral for a loan. What he 
means is:
1. God hands us something immediately with the promise He’ll “repay” us with something greater in the 
future. In other words, the Holy Spirit is God’s guarantee to us that He’ll give us something greater in the 
future
2. The Holy Spirit is something we get to hold onto and make use of in the meantime
3. The Holy Spirit will never—can never—be taken away from us, as he is “surety”

2 Cor.

&COR2 2
1|Getting to the point, I made up my mind that I wouldn’t visit you again 
while laden with the pains of sorrow. 
2|In fact, if I’m making you feel sorry, who in 
particular will cheer me up apart from the one I made feel sorry? 
3|The very thing I 
wrote, I wrote so that I wouldn’t come for a visit and wind up being made sorry[a] by 
the ones I ought to rejoice over, as my nearness to you all has convinced me that my joy 
is derived from you all. 
4|In fact, what I wrote to you through many tears came out of 
a great deal of distress and heart-felt anguish, not so that it would cause you sorrow, 
but so that you’d understand the abundant love which I have for you.
          
5|If a certain person has caused sorrow, he hasn’t caused me sorrow (actually 
no, he has partially), so I won’t dump[b] any more of this on you all. 
6|The very 
punishment inflicted by the many is enough for such a person, 
7|so that on the flip-
side, you should be all the more kind and merciful to him and comfort and encourage 
him, so that such a person not somehow be deluged with even more sorrow. 
8|In light 
of this I advise you to broadcast[c] love to him. 
9|In fact, another reason I wrote is so 
that I could discern if you live up to my standards, that is if you obey everything you’re 
told. 
10|Now if you forgive somebody of something, so do I; you see, if in addition to 
you I forgave somebody of something, what I’ve forgiven (assuming there’s something I’m 
forgiving), I did so through you under the scrutiny[d] of Christ, 
11|so that we won’t 
be swindled by Satan: we are not ignorant of his intentions, you see.
          
12|Now that I’ve arrived at Troas for the purpose of spreading the Gospel of 
Christ (i.e., the good news about Christ), a door has been opened to me in the Lord (i.e., 
in regard to the things of the Lord, a tremendous opportunity has presented itself to 
me), 
13|I was uncomfortable[e] in my spirit not finding my fellow-comrade[f] Titus, 
so instead I excused myself, said goodbye to them, and left for Macedonia.
          
14|But thank-you God, Who always makes us roadies on Christ’s victory 
tour[A], and Who’s propagating the fragrance of his knowledge[g] through us in all 
regions, 
15|since in God we are a pleasant[h] aroma (like the incense they burned in the 
Old Testament, or the pleasing smell of a burnt offering) of Christ among those being saved 
(i.e., those being rescued from calamity) and among those perishing; 
16|we who on 
the one hand are a whiff of going from death to even more death[B], and on the other hand 
are a whiff of going from life to even more life—and that’s not good enough for some 
people? 
*[a]wind up being made sorry…Lit: have sorrow
*[b]dump…on you…Lit: burden you
*[c]broadcast…Lit: preach
*[d]under the scrutiny of…Lit: in the face of
*[e]I was uncomfortable…Also: I remained ill at ease
*[f]my fellow-comrade…Lit: my brother
*[g]fragrance of his knowledge…A well-crafted metaphor, one which is continued in the next couple of 
verses
*[h]pleasant…Or: sweet-smelling
*[i]hustle…The meaning of this Gk. word is “trade in, peddle, huckster.” It refers to “the tricks of small 
tradesmen,” so “…the word almost comes to mean adulterate” (Danker & Bauer).
*[j]like it’s coming from someone who’s sincere through-and-through…Lit: as out of sincerity. An idiom.
*[k]we speak the word of God in Christ like it’s coming directly from God while we stand before God…Lit: as 
from out of God before God in Christ we speak. Same idiom as before.

*[A]makes us roadies on Christ’s victory tour…Or: leads us around in a triumphal procession in Christ. Some 
liberties taken. The single Gk. word used here refers to the following: In Roman times, generals returned 
from a battlefield victory in a procession and led the procession through the capitol. The triumphal 
general and his lieutenants formed the vanguard of the procession; those in the defeated enemy’s army, 
including women and children, were bound and formed the rear of the procession, being led to the city 
to be sold as slaves. The analogy is that we are a part of the procession, though I prefer to believe that 
we’re part of the vanguard and not the rear, but that’s open to debate.
[B]a whiff of going from death to even more death…from life to even more life…Lit: a smell out of death 
unto death…out of life unto life. Same Gk. wording as is used in in Paul’s statement from faith to faith 
(Rom. 1:17), as this is the same expression. Similar to the English usage of whiff, the usage here means a 
living example; a glimpse. Paul’s life and his companions’ lives exemplify a life of death and, even more, 
of life and even more life. Paul goes into detail about the death he’s referring to in the eleventh and 
twelfth chapters; but in the midst of this Paul experiences more and more of the life of God.

17|You see, we’re not like so many other preachers who hustle[i] the word of 
God—no—we preach the Gospel like it’s coming from someone who’s sincere through-

&COR2 3
1|Are my comrades and I starting over again in doing self-promotion to bolster 
your opinion of us? Put another way, we’re not in need of letters of recommendation to be 
sent to you or to be received from you, like some people do, are we? 
2|You are our letter 
of recommendation, written in our hearts, understood and read by all people. 
3|It’s 
plain for all to see that you are a letter of Christ transcribed and delivered[a] by us; not 
written with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not written in stone but written in 
a flesh-heart.
          
4|We’re convinced that we have such a thing through Christ with God— 

5|Not that we’re up-to-par in and of ourselves to where we figure that something in 
particular which is good was self-generated, but rather that our adequacy comes out of 
God, 
6|Who also made us up-to-par ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter (i.e., 
the literal, exacting listing of rules, compliance with those rules, and consequences for 
breaking them) but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, but the Spirit causes things to spring 
into life.
          
7|Now if the administering of death, which was packaged in letters etched in 
stone, occurred in glory to the point that it wasn’t possible for the run-of-the-mill 
Israelite[b] to gaze at Moses’s face because of the glory of his face—a glory that was 
deteriorating no less— 
8|how much more will the administering of the Spirit be 
accompanied by[c] glory? 
9|Furthermore, if there was glory in the administering of 
condemnation, how much more does the administering of righteousness exceed it in 
glory? 
10|And furthermore, that which has been made glorious hasn’t been made 
glorious relative to[d] the glory which surpasses it. 
11|In fact, if the glory which has 
been nullified has been nullified by glory, the glory which remains does so all the more 
in glory.
          
12|So having such hope, in our outspokenness and boldness we conceal 
nothing, 
13|unlike Moses who placed a veil over his face so that the run-of-the-mill 
Israelites couldn’t gaze at the vestige of the glory that was deteriorating— 
14|not a 
chance—their minds were dead-set against it[e]. In fact to this very day the same veil 
remains uncovered at the reading of the Old Testament[f], since it’s done away with in 
Christ. 
15|No—to this day whenever the Old Testament[f] happens to be read aloud 
a veil lies over their heart, 
16|but, if they were to turn to the Lord, the moment they 
do so, the veil gets taken off.
          
17|Now the Lord is in lockstep with the Spirit, and there’s freedom where the 
Spirit of the Lord is. 
*[a]transcribed and delivered…Lit: serviced

18|While gazing at the glory of the Lord with an uncovered 
face as though we’re looking intently in a mirror, we all are transformed into the same 
image going from one gaze of glory to another gaze of even more glory[g], just as we go from 
one gaze of the Spirit of the Lord to another gaze of even more of the Spirit.


&COR2 4
1|On account of this, that is of having this administering of righteousness, to the 
degree that we’ve been shown mercy, we don’t lose heart— 
2|on the contrary, we quit 
for good doing those things that we’re ashamed of that we keep hidden[a], not going 
here and there playing games with people[b], nor putting a spin on[c] the word of God, 
rather by means of the propagation of the truth we leave a good impression deep inside 
of everyone else[d] while under God’s scrutiny[e]. 
3|But even if our Gospel, our Good 
News Message, is veiled, it’s veiled among those who are perishing, 
4|among whom 
the god of this age (i.e., this current era of mankind’s history) blinded the minds of 
those who refuse to believe to where they don’t see the light of the Gospel of the glory 
of Christ, who is a spitting image of God. 
5|You see, we don’t preach that we 
ourselves are your superiors but rather that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that we ourselves are 
your humble servants[f] on account of Jesus, 
6|since the God Who said, “Light shall 
shine out of darkness,” is the One Who shined in our hearts with the light of the 
knowledge and understanding of the glory of God by means of the direct attention of[g] 
Jesus Christ.
          
7|We have this treasure in clay storage vessels (i.e., physical bodies) so that the 
over-and-above power would be of God and not from ourselves. 
8|We’re pressured 
from every direction and in trouble, but no—we’re not at the end of our rope[h]; 
confused as to what to do—but not totally confused; 
9|persecuted but not abandoned; 
knocked off our feet but not destroyed; 
10|always carrying around in our body the 
death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus would also be manifested in our body. 

11|You see, we the living are forever being forced into a position where death has 
control over us because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus would also be manifested in our 
mortal body.
          
12|So then, the death I just described is at work in us, but the life I likewise 
described is at work in you. 
13|Having a spirit of (i.e., a prevailing attitude of) faith 
that’s the same as what’s written in the Old Testament, “I believed, and in light of it all I 
spoke,” we too believe, and in light of it all we too speak, 
14|knowing for a fact 
that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us together with Jesus and together 
with him cast us in a favorable light in God’s estimation[i]. 
15|You see, all these things 
are for your sake, so that the grace bestowed on us, having proliferated through the 
thanksgiving of the many, would abound to God’s glory.
          
16|In light of this we’re not losing heart; on the contrary, even though our 
outer-person is deteriorating, yet our inner-person is being renewed day-in, day-out[j]. 

17|To this point, the light weight of our affliction is incomparable to the heavy 
weight of glory at work in us, 
*[a]those things that we’re ashamed of that we keep hidden…Lit: the hidden things of shame. A figure of 
speech.
*[b]playing games with people…Lit: in craftiness
*[c]putting a spin on…Lit: falsifying. Comes from root meaning deceit; treachery.
*[d]we leave a good impression deep inside of everyone else…Lit: commending ourselves to all consciences 
of men
*[e]while under God’s scrutiny…Lit: before God
*[f]humble servants…Lit: slaves. A figure of speech.
*[g]the direct attention of…Lit: [the] face of
*[h]at the end of our rope…Or: boxed in
*[i]cast us in a favorable light in God’s estimation…Lit: present us, or, make us presentable. The picture is 
of a person presenting himself before a king, or someone presenting an offering at a temple. The 
implication is that the person or thing presented will leave a good impression.
[j]day-in, day-out…Lit: day and day

18|while we’re not looking at the things which are

&COR2 5
1|In fact, we know for certain that if our Earth-suit[a] were to be demolished[b], 
we have a building from God—an eternal building, one that’s not of human 
construction—way up in the sky[c]. 
2|In connection to this we do groan, longing to put 
on (i.e., as though putting on a piece of clothing) our home—our cozy cottage[d]—which 
comes from heaven. 
3|If we really have put on our eternal building[A], we won’t be 
caught naked. 
4|Furthermore, we whose present form of existence is with the Earth-suit 
do groan, being encumbered[e], the crux of which is that we don’t want to be stripped of 
our garments but to be clothed instead, so that the death we carry about would be 
thoroughly dowsed by the life. 
5|Now He Who did the necessary work in us to make 
this very thing happen to us is God, the One Who gave us the down payment[f] of the 
Spirit.
          
6|So keep your chin up—always—and know for certain that making 
yourselves at home in the body will leave you far from home[g] with the Lord 
7|(we go 
about our lives[h] by faith and not by sight, you see), 
8|but with our chins held high 
and thinking positively, we’d rather be far from home in regard to the body but make 
ourselves at home with the Lord. 
9|And so whether at home or away from home, we 
aspire to be pleasing to him: 
10|the fact of the matter is that every one of us must 
appear before the Judge, Christ the Judge, so that each individual’s deeds, deeds which 
were committed by the body, whether they were good or bad—all of them—would be 
brought before the Judge to be judged by him.
          
11|Now that we’ve acquired a firm understanding of the fear of the Lord, 
we convince other people to do the same. We’ve been made manifest[i] to God (i.e., we’ve 
presented ourselves before God), and I hope to reach the point where we’ve been made 
manifest to your consciences as well— 
12|Not that we’re trying to promote 
ourselves again[j], but are giving you the chance to talk proudly about us instead, so that 
you would have something good to say to those who take pride in and talk big about 
peoples’ behavior on the surface, or the masks people present to others, and not what’s 
in the heart. 
13|The fact of the matter is that if it’s the case that I’ve lost my mind, 
I’ve lost my mind for God; if it’s the case that I’m sane, I’m sane for you. 
14|The love 
of Christ has a tight grip on us, you see, and has determined that this is the case: that one 
person died in everyone’s place[k] (therefore everyone died), 
15|and he died in 
everyone’s place so that the living would no longer live for themselves but that they 
would instead live for him who died and was raised in their place.
          
16|An outcome of all this is that, from now on, there’s nobody we form a 
perception of according to the flesh (i.e., according to a person’s physical body and 
outward appearance; his limited ability in and of himself), even if we had come to know 
and understand Christ according to the flesh—but, no, we no longer know and 
understand him according to the flesh.
          
17|An outcome of all this is that if someone is in Christ (melded with him: in 
him, with him, and living life by means of him), he’s a new type of species, a new kind 
of creature, a new creation: the old has come and gone[l] and—get this—the new has 
come into being[B]. 
18|Now all these new things are from God, Who by Christ 
reconciled us with Himself and gave us the Reconciliation Ministry, 
19|that is that 
God was in Christ reconciling the world (i.e., those who don’t know and live for God) to 
Himself, not holding all the times they crossed over the line in doing wrong as strikes 
against them[m], and assigning to us the task of keeping and spreading the message of 
reconciliation. 
20|So we’re ambassadors of Christ as we’re encouraging, exhorting, 
and advising others in matters pertaining to God. And this is the message we tell them: “As 
a representative of Christ I ask you—I beg you—to be reconciled to God. 
*[a]Earth-suit…Lit: on-earth house of tent. Some liberties taken.
*[b]demolished…Lit: completely broken into pieces. The word describes breaking a stone edifice apart, as 
it’s the same root word Jesus used to describe the dispersal of the stones of the Temple.
*[c]way up in the sky…Lit: in the heavens
*[d]our home—our cozy cottage…The Gk. word here is a diminutive form of house, and as such acquires a 
connotation of coziness
*[e]encumbered…Lit: weighed down
*[f]down payment…Ref. note of 1:22
*[g]making yourself at home in the body will leave you far from home…Lit (inserting a couple of key Gk. 
words): endāmountos (ἐνδημέω/Strong’s 1736)in the body ekdāmoumen (ἐκδημέω/Strong’s 1553). 
These two Gk. words forms a rhyme, assonance, or pun, making this a figure of speech.
*[h]go about our lives…Lit: walk around
*[i]manifest…The same Gk. verb is rendered appear in v. 10, and assuming that the reuse in v. 11 here 
links the two thoughts together, then what Paul means by “manifest” in v. 11 is similar to its usage in v. 
10, i.e. of appearing before a judge to have your deeds reviewed and judged.
*[j]Not that we’re trying to promote ourselves again…Same wording as 3:1
*[k]in everyone’s place…Also: on everyone’s behalf
*[l]come and gone…Lit: passed by
*[m]not holding all the times they crossed over the line in doing wrong as strikes against them…Lit: not 
reckoning their trespasses to them
*[n]was made…Lit: made

*[A]If we really have put on our eternal building …Or: If we really have shed our clothing….The UBS Greek 
NT, 3rd Edition reads shed our clothing (also, undressed or stripped naked); the photocopies of both 
Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus read put on instead (and a translation of the Latin Vulgate agrees), 
therefore most of the translators render this put on and not undressed. One can only speculate if the 
UBS made a mistake here or if they changed the reading based on “internal” considerations and didn’t 
footnote with a citation of the various manuscripts. The UBS reading makes sense: assuming such a 
reading, the “undressing” referred to would be the same as “if our Earth-suit were to be demolished” (v. 
1). When the physical body is destroyed, we’ll be clothed with a heavenly body, rather than being 
“found naked.”
*[B]the new has come into being…The KJV says “all things are become new.” The words “all things” are not 
found in the better manuscripts.
*[C]righteous of a nature of God’s righteousness…Lit: [a] righteousness of God. Noteworthy is that, in the 
GT, there’s no definite article preceding righteousness. This verse does not say we would become the 
righteousness of God (insertion of definite article before righteous), but that we would become 
righteous in a way that our righteousness is of the same nature as God’s righteousness. This is a far cry 
from becoming equivalent to God in His righteousness—which is an absurd proposition.

2 Cor.

1|Being those who work together to minister to others[a], we do plead with you to 
not take in God’s grace and have nothing to show for it. 
2|In fact, the Old Testament 
says,

I heard you just in time
And I helped you
That time you needed to be rescued[b]

Hey! “Just in time” is now—Hey! “The time you needed to be rescued” is now.
          
3|Don’t give anyone any reason to be seriously offended[c] by something you did 
wrong, so that the ministry of God’s grace won’t be criticized— 
4|Uh-uh—leaving 
others with an impression that’s expected of God’s ministers, and doing this with a good 
deal of perseverance, doing this in times of distress, in times of privation, while in 
anguish, 
5|while being whipped or beaten, while in prison, during riots, while doing 
hard, grueling work, in sleepless nights, while going hungry; 
6|doing this with purity, 
with understanding, with patience, with kindness; do this in the Holy Spirit, in sincere 
love, 
7|with a message of truth[d], in the power of God, by being armed with the armor 
and weapons of righteousness that the left and right hands are accustomed to handle[e]; 

8|through glory and disgrace, through a bad reputation and a good reputation; as 
though we’re deceived and as though we know the truth, 
9|as though we’re not 
known or understood and as though we’re known and understood, as though we’re 
dying but—hey—we’re still alive; as though we’re being reprimanded but not 
sentenced to death, 
10|as though we’re in pain but ever rejoicing, as though we’re 
poor but becoming quite wealthy, as though we own nothing but own everything.
          
11|We haven’t stopped engaging you in dialogue[f], Corinthians; our heart is 
fixed wide open to you. 
12|Don’t be closed off to us—but with the sort of “closed off” 
which keeps us in your tender affections. 
13|When it’s your turn to reciprocate (I’m 
talking to you like I would to a child), open yourselves up to us.
          
14|Don’t get unevenly yoked (i.e., like an ox and a donkey yoked together 
on the same plow harness) with unbelievers. What partnership is there between 
righteousness and lawlessness (i.e., the refusal to be restrained by the rules of God or of 
man)? What do light and darkness have in common? 
15|What harmony is there 
between Christ and the Devil[g]? How does a believer partake in joint ventures with an 
unbeliever? 
16|How does God’s temple approve of or validate an idol’s temple? 
You are a temple of the Living God, in fact, just as God said,

“I will dwell and move among them,
And I will be their God,
And they will be my folk-people.

&COR2 7
1|So having these promises I quoted just now, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves 
from all defilement of flesh (i.e., of carnality) and spirit[A], while bringing holiness to 
perfection in the deep reverence—downright fear—of God.
          
2|Accomodate us: we haven’t wronged anyone, ruined anyone, or taken 
advantage of anyone. 
3|I’m not pointing any fingers[a]; in fact I’ve stated before that 
you are in our hearts for the rest of our lives, until death do us part. 
4|It’s a lot for me 
to be blunt with you, a lot for me to talk about you with pride. I’ve reached the point 
where I’m full of encouragement and comfort; I’m way overjoyed every time we’re 
faced with a really bad situation.
          
5|In fact, not once after arriving in Macedonia did our weary bodies get a 
chance to rest, uh-uh…all kinds of pressure…on the outside we faced conflict, on the 
inside fear. 
6|In contrast, God was the One Who encouraged us the abased by having 
Titus show up. 
7|Not just by him showing up, but by the encouragement, comfort, 
and advise he showered on us, relaying to us your longing, your grieving, your fervency 
you have regarding me, resulting in it giving me all the more joy.
          
8|Even if I hurt you by what I put in the previous letter, I have no regrets; even if 
I had regrets (for I see that that letter did cause you pain for some time), 
9|I’m glad 
now, not because you were simply hurt, but rather that the pain that you suffered 
resulted in a change of heart and of actions[b]. In fact, you were hurt God’s way, so you 
suffered no loss in any area of your life. 
10|You see, being hurt (hurt intentionally in 
a way that you suffer pain) God’s way effects a change of heart and actions working 
towards the end goal of dodging a bullet[c] and having no regrets about what had to be 
done to accomplish that; the pain that the world (i.e., those outside of Christ) 
experiences works in a way that, when it’s run its course, results in death (i.e., a 
stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, destruction, and ultimately physical death).
          
11|While I’m on this topic, this very thing—being[d] hurt God’s way—look 
how much it accomplished in you and what a priority you made it. From where you were 
instead is a rebuttal—instead you have indignation, fear, longing, fervency, and self-
vindication. In everything you demonstrated to everyone that you’re cleared of these 
matters[e]. 
12|So now, that I’m even writing to you at all, I’m not doing so because of 
something you did wrong or because of some wrong done to us, rather because of the 
priority and urgency at which you’ve made the things we confronted you with before 
God materialize. 
13|We’ve been encouraged by this.
      On the subject of what’s been an encouragement to us, hearing the news that Titus 
is happy gave me even more joy, since his spirit was refreshed by you all. 
14|I had 
told him a thing or two about you, telling him how proud I am of you, and I wasn’t 
disappointed or embarrassed. On the contrary—as we’ve always been truthful with you 
when we’ve talked to you, in the same vein our speaking with pride about you to Titus 
turned out to be true as well. 
15|The tender affection he has for you is that much 
more when recalling every time you did as you were told, as you received him with fear 
and trembling[f]. 
*[a]I’m not pointing any fingers…Lit: I’m not saying condemnation
*[b]a change of heart and of actions…Lit: repentance
*[c]dodging a bullet…Or: escaping calamity…Lit: unto salvation
*[d]being…Lit: to have been
*[e]you’re cleared of these matters…Lit: you to be innocent to the matters
*[f]fear and trembling…A biblical expression (Ps. 55:5; Eph. 6:5; Phil 2:12 for example)

[A]cleanse yourselves from all defilement of flesh (i.e., carnal nature) and spirit…A metaphor which 
compares the water purification rituals specified by the Law of Moses which the Jews had to do on a 
regular basis to a self-cleansing of the things inside a person which are not holy.

1|Just wanted you to know[a], comrades[b], about the grace of God that’s been 
granted to the churches in Macedonia, 
2|that in such a severe trial brought on by 
distress, the abundance of their joy and the vast extent of their poverty[c][A] amplified the 
richness of their generosity— 
3|that according to their means—I swear—even beyond 
their means—and of their own free accord— 
4|with a good deal of explanations, 
assurances, and exhortation they were asking us to do them a favor and allow them to 
participate in ministering to the saints (i.e., their fellow believers).
          
5|And they didn’t just do this the way we expected[d] they would—no—by the will 
of God they first dedicated themselves to the Lord and to us, 
6|resulting in us having 
encouraged Titus to finish off this favor, which is being done for you in a consistent 
manner to how he started it. 
7|That aside, just as you continuously take everything to 
a new level[e]—faith, attestation[f], knowledge and understanding, eager diligence, and 
the love which came out of us and was imparted in you[g]—apply the same principles so that 
you would take this act of charity to the next level as well.
          
8|What I’m saying shouldn’t be construed as an order, but certainly as a test[h] 
of the authenticity of your love by the zeal which motivates others. 
9|In fact you 
know the act of charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he, being rich, became poor for 
your sake so that by that impoverishment you would become rich. 
10|I’ll give you 
my opinion on this topic: this benefits you, you the very ones who, beginning last year 
and continuing thenceforth, didn’t just begin to tackle this but maintained the desire to do 
it.
          
11|But now complete the doing-part as well, so that just as the enthusiasm 
of the wanting-part was prevalent from the inception, so the completion of the deed from the 
what-do-we-possess-part is the natural consequence of the wanting. 
12|For if the 
enthusiasm’s in place, whatever gift a given person comes up with is acceptable according to 
whatever wealth and belongings that person happens to possess, not according to what 
he doesn’t possess. 
13|You see, this isn’t so that others can take it easy while you’re 
subjected to hardship, but it’s done out of equality. 
14|The way things stand at the 
moment, your abundance of material possessions is directed towards their lack so that 
equality would take shape, 
15|just as it’s written,

He who has much didn’t have a surplus
And he who has a little didn’t lack

          
16|But God is so kind[i]: for our sake He’s putting the same eagerness to get 
the job done in Titus’s heart, 
17|since, while—yes—he took the counsel, advise, and 
encouragement that was given to him to heart, but, being more eager than ever, of his 
own volition he left on a trip to visit you. 
18|We sent someone to go with him, the 
comrade who’s praised throughout all the churches in his preaching of the Gospel— 

19|not just to go along for the ride but to be our travelling companion as well, hand-
picked to be the churches’ attaché with respect to this act of charity, which is the service 
done by us to the glory of the Lord and which is a token of our enthusiasm.
          
20|The intention is that no one would find fault with us in our handling of 
this generous gift. 
21|In fact, we considered ahead of time what the decent thing to 
do would be, not just from the Lord’s perspective but also from the perspective of the 
average person. 
22|We sent our comrade along with the others, he who at many 
times and in many ways has proven to be eager, diligent, and to get things done 
without dragging his feet, but now is even more eager because of the tremendous 
confidence he has in you.
          
23|Whether I’m speaking on behalf of Titus, my fellow worker and a mentor 
and assistant[B] for you, or whether I’m speaking on behalf of our comrades the apostles of 
churches (i.e., those who are pioneers in founding churches; missionaries who establish 
churches), in either case the glory goes to Christ. 
*[a]just wanted you to know…Lit: we’re making known to you
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]in such a severe trial brought on by distress, the abundance of their joy and the vast extent of their 
poverty…Lit: in much test of affliction the abundance of their joy and their poverty
*[d]expected…Lit: hoped
*[e]take everything to a new level…Lit: abound in all
*[f]attestation…Lit: word
*[g]came out of us and was imparted in you…The principle manuscripts are split here, with the others 
reading of you to us.

*[i]God is so kind…Lit: grace with [or to] God

taking up a collection for.
[B]mentor and assistant…Lit: fellow worker. The two Gk. words for fellow worker, namely koinonos 
(κοινωνός /Strong’s 2844)and sunergos (συνεργός/Strong’s 4904), are both used in this verse, and the 
distinction between these words is apparent by the usage here. This distinction is not found in the 
lexicons.

your love and of the tremendous things we tell them about you is taking place in full

&COR2 9
1|As a matter of fact, I sure do have more to write to you concerning this 
ministry-drive for the saints (i.e., our fellow believers). 
2|You see, having observed 
you, I know your enthusiasm, an enthusiasm I speak proudly about to the 
Macedonians, namely that Achaia started making preparations a year ago and that your 
passion for this project motivated a great many people[a] there. 
3|I dispatched the 
comrades[b] so that the tremendous things we say about you regarding this matter 
would not be for nothing, so that it would be just like I kept saying over and over again 
that you were making preparations— 
4|but it’s not as though the Macedonians and I 
were going to somehow get together and go and catch you unprepared[c] and we—dare 
I say you too[d]—would be embarrassed at what’s behind it all[e].
          
5|Anyways, to give the comrades encouragement was the most important 
thing to do, so that they would arrive in your locale ahead of time and put in order your 
pledged blessing (i.e., charitable contribution) ahead of time. These arrangements are 
thus so that the entire affair is done the way a blessing is done and not the way a 
shakedown for money is done.
          
6|Now onto this: he who sows parsimoniously also reaps parsimoniously and 
he who sows with a mindset of blessing others also reaps a blessing because of that 
mindset[f]. 
7|Let the offering from each person be according to what he decided in his 
heart beforehand, not out of an inner pain of regret in having to part with one’s money or 
out of compulsion, for God loves a cheerful, glad, happy, prompt-to-do giver. 
8|In 
fact God is able to proliferate all kinds of grace (i.e., good things, in terms of money and 
material goods) to us, so that in all situations always having enough of everything you 
would exude any and every good work[g], 
9|just as it’s written:

He scattered, he gave to the needy
His righteousness remains in place forever

          
10|Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for the food that you 
eat[A] will provide and multiply your seed and will cause the crop of your righteous 
endeavor to grow[h], 
11|being made rich in all respects, towards an ends of complete 
simplicity (i.e., a heart which has the single, simple motive of giving, and therefore has 
no ulterior motive, attaches no strings, and gives without any of the complications of 
guilt, remorse, etc.; does so under no threat, no compulsion, nor because of any rule, 
religious or otherwise), which through us works God’s praise to the nth degree, 

12|because the ministry which consists of this religious ritual, this act of worship, 
this service to God, is not simply the supplying of the saints’ needs but also the causing 
of a multiplication-effect through much praise to God— 
13|Through the proof of 
this ministry, God has been glorified in the compliance with what you said you were 
going to do[i] for the Good News of Christ, the Gospel, and the simplicity of the act of 
sharing with them and with everyone, 
14|and their prayer for you, longing for you 
on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you.
          
*[a]a great many people…Lit: the many [majority]
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]unprepared…Or: off-guard
*[d]dare I say you too…Lit: so that I wouldn’t say “you”. The NASB renders this: not to mention you.
*[e]at what’s behind it all…Lit: in this the substance [or undergirding; foundation; core]. Appears to be an 
expression.
*[f]he who sows with a mindset of blessing others also reaps a blessing because of that mindset…Lit: the 
one sowing at [i.e., at the exact location of; right over top of] a blessing at a blessing reaps
*[g]exude any and every good work…Lit: abound unto all good work
*[h]will cause the crop of your righteous endeavor to grow…Lit: will grow the crop of your righteousness. A 
metaphor comparing the doing of a righteous deed to growing a crop.
*[i]what you said you were going to do…Lit: your confession
*[j]God is so kind with this indescribable gift of His…Lit: grace with [or to] God at the indescribable gift of 
His

[A]bread for the food that you eat…Lit: bread for food. the majority of one’s calories were derived from 
eating bread in ancient times. In the context of the writing of this epistle, therefore, bread was what 
people survived on (ref. Matt. 6:11). So saying that God will supply bread for food means that God will 
supply what you need to eat.

&COR2 10
1|I, Paul, through the gentle restraint and kindness of Christ, who, when I was 
here on Earth face-to-face with you was humble indeed, but audacious when away from 
you, beg you personally— 
2|but with the infusion of audacity which comes from not 
being present—I ask with confidence, which I figure makes me brash enough to 
confront some people who suppose that we live day in, day out[a] according to the flesh 
(i.e. of our own ability apart from God; as though God doesn’t work through us). 

3|You see, though living day in, day out in flesh (i.e., in a physical body, one subject to 
human weaknesses), we don’t wage war according to the flesh: 
4|our battle-gear isn’t 
fleshly (i.e., of a physical nature; of our own ability apart from God)—uh-uh, it’s quite 
capable in God of leveling heavily-fortified defenses—leveling schemes, machinations, 
detailed plans, 
5|and every erected fortification or entrenched high-ground[b] which 
opposes the knowledge and understanding of God, and capturing every thought and 
making it a prisoner of the obedience of Christ[A], 
6|and of being prepared to avenge 
every disobedience, when your obedience happens to reach the tipping point.
          
7|You’re seeing things as they appear on the surface[c]. If a given person has 
convinced himself that he’s derived from Christ, let this fellow rethink the logic again as 
it applies to himself and let him come to the conclusion that, just as he himself is derived 
from Christ, we also are derived from Christ in the same way as he. 
8|So now, if I 
venture to say something even more cocky about our authority (an authority which the 
Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, by the way), I won’t 
embarrass myself and have to eat my words because I’ve failed in this regard[d], 

9|embarassed so that I not revel in delight[e], as you might be scared out of your wits by 
what I wrote in the letters. 
10|Since a few people say, “Sure—the letters cut to the 
bone and pack a punch[f], but he comes across as weak when you see him in person and 
his speaking ability and rhetoric[g] is contemptuous,” 
11|Let any such person who 
says that think this over: what we are in writing through the mail when absent, such we 
are in what we do when present as well.
          
12|Furthermore, we dare not put ourselves in the same category as some of 
the self-promoters or compare ourselves to them—no—they get off to the side by 
themselves and rank themselves and do self-endorsements to one another[h]—they just 
don’t get it. 
13|We’re not going to speak proudly or say tremendous things[i] about 
the things outside our sphere of ministry[B]—no—we’ll speak proudly about the things 
within the sphere which the God of a limit to such spheres assigned to us to envelop even 
you within that sphere. 
14|In fact, it’s not as though we don’t envelop you while 
extending our reach out to the perimeter of our sphere and beyond; you see, in the course 
of enveloping you by our sphere, we were the first to arrive in your locale with the Good 
News, the Gospel of Christ— 
15|No, we don’t speak proudly about things outside 
our sphere, namely about the toils of others, but we’re hoping, as your faith which is 
among you is being grown, to vastly enlarge our sphere, 
16|that is for places 
beyond you to be evangelized—and not to speak proudly about the fruition of somebody 
else’s long-term plans[j] taking place in his sphere, 
17|but like it says, ”He who 
speaks proudly, let him speak proudly of what he does in the Lord.”
          
*[a]live day in, day out…Lit: walk about
*[b]erected fortification or entrenched high-ground…Lit: height lifted up
*[c]You’re seeing things as they appear on the surface…Lit: You’re seeing according to face. Note that the 
phrase according to face is used in v. 1 (face-to-face), although the meaning there appears to be 
different.
*[d]embarrass myself and have to eat my words because I’ve failed in this regard…Lit: be put to shame
*[e]revel in delight…Lit: glory
*[f]cut to the bone and pack a punch…Lit: are weighty and strong. The word weighty also appears in Matt. 
23:23, being used the same way there.
*[g]speaking ability and rhetoric…Lit: the word
*[h]they get off to the side by themselves and rank themselves and do self-endorsements to one 
another…Lit: they themselves among themselves measure themselves and commend themselves. The 
repetition of themselves is a figure of speech.
*[i]speak proudly or say tremendous things…Also: boast
*[j]the fruition of…long-term plans…Lit: the preparations

*[A]capturing every thought and making it a prisoner of the obedience of Christ…The passage of vv. 3–6 is 
a metaphor comparing the Christian struggles in their faith to the mechanics of waging war.
[B]sphere of ministry…Lit: sphere. It’s not exactly clear to me what Paul is talking about in this passage, 
the passage consisting of vv. 13–16. Certain words have vague definitions and aren’t clarified by usage in 
other parts of the NT.

1|If you would bear with me a bit while I act stupid—scratch that: you are 
bearing with me. 
2|You see, I dote over you zealously[a] with a zealous doting that’s of 
God, for I’ve betrothed you to only one man[b] in order to present to this one man a chaste 
virgin in Christ. 
3|I fear that somehow that’s not the case—as the serpent deceived 
Eve with his cunning trickery, he would somehow seduce your minds and draw you 
away from the simplicity[c] (i.e., straightforward, without conniving, ulterior motives, 
hidden agendas, or religious quid-pro-quo) and the purity which has Christ as its goal.
          
4|For indeed, if a passerby stops over and preaches that another person is the 
real Jesus, a person whom we didn’t preach as being the real Jesus, or you receive (i.e., 
take to heart and wholeheartedly embrace) a different spirit which you didn’t receive 
before, or you wholeheartedly embrace a different good-news-type message that you 
didn’t receive[d], you tolerate it with no qualms. 
5|You see, the way I figure, we’re not 
inferior to these so-called super-apostles in any category. 
6|But even if I’m an amateur 
when it comes to speaking ability and rhetoric[e], put that aside—I’m not an amateur 
when it comes to knowledge and understanding—no—I’ve made that apparent to you 
in every possible way[f].
          
7|Is it that I committed a sin in humbling and debasing myself so that you 
would be made to stand on two legs[g], since I evangelized the good news of the Gospel 
to you sacrificially on my part and delivered it to you free of charge? 
8|Scratch that—I 
robbed other churches by drawing a wage from them and applying it to your ministry. 

9|Not only that, when I was staying with you and was in need, I wasn’t a burden to 
anyone: the comrades[h] who came from Macedonia provided what I needed. My living 
expenses weren’t a burden in any way to you, nor will they be. 
10|Christ in me 
unequivocally indicates that this is true[i]: I won’t be denied the opportunity to speak 
with pride about what we will accomplish in the Lord in the region of Achaia[j]. 
11|Why 
would I be denied? Because I don’t love you? God knows for a fact that I do.
          
12|What I’m doing I’ll continue to do in order to nix the occasion for fault-
finding by those who are wanting to find such an occasion, so that in the specific area that 
they’re boasting of, everyone will come to the conclusion[k] that they’re also like us. 

13|In fact, false apostles such as they, workers of deceit, are disguising themselves 
as apostles of Christ— 
14|And it’s not surprising: Satan himself disguises himself 
as an angel of light. 
15|So there’s not a huge difference if his servants the false apostles 
also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. The way it ends for these false 
apostles will be in step with their deeds.[l]
          
16|Moving on to another topic.[m] Nobody should take me for a fool, but 
should it be otherwise, accept me even as a fool, so that even as a fool I have some little 
thing or two to say about my tremendous accomplishments. 
17|What I’m about to say 
isn’t in line with how the Lord speaks, but are words you’d expect to come out of one in 
the throes of folly—the essence of the boasting you’re about to hear.
          
18|Since many are talking up great things they’ve done according to flesh 
(i.e., from their own ability apart from God; taking credit for it personally and not 
giving God the credit), I’ll talk up my tremendous accomplishments too. 
19|The 
fact of the matter is, you’re more than happy to tolerate what the fools spout off, 
treating them like they’re sensible and wise[A]. 
20|You put up with someone if he 
subjugates and oppresses you, if he cheats you out of house and home, if he sets you up 
to take advantage of you, if he lifts himself up in arrogance, if he slaps you upside the 
head[B]. 
21|I’m ashamed to say it, but it’s as though you disdain us because we’ve 
become weak in what someone else might dare speak proudly about.
      I’m talking foolishly, but I’ll dare speak anyways. 
22|Are they native-Hebrew 
speakers and live by the ancient Jewish culture?—So do I. Are they Israelites?—So am I. 
Are they father-to-son direct descendants and heirs of[n] Abraham?—So am I. 

23|Are they Christ’s servants (I’m talking like a mad man)?—I’ll up them one: as 
far as hard labor goes, I’ve done more. I’ve spent more time in prison. I’ve received 
more beatings. I’ve had more near-death experiences: 
24|I’ve received the thirty-
nine lash punishment by the Jews five times; 
25|I’ve been beaten with staffs three 
times; I was stoned to death once; I was shipwrecked three times; I spent twenty-four 
straight hours floundering out in the ocean[o]. 
26|I’ve been on the road many a time 
walking great distances; I’ve been in danger while travelling by river; in danger from 
robbers; in danger by my fellow countrymen; in danger by those in faraway countries; 
in danger in the city; in danger in the countryside; in danger on the high seas; in danger 
from phony comrades; 
27|I worked hard, long hours and did heavy manual labor; 
had many a sleepless night; went long stretches with nothing to eat or nothing to drink; 
fasted many times; was cold because I had nothing to wear[p]— 
28|Besides those 
external pressures, there is the pressure on the inside of me due to the day-to-day 
responsibility for all the churches, worrying over them. 
29|Who’s weak (i.e., sickly, 
frail, or simply unable to muster the strength to face life’s challenges), and I’m not weak 
along with them? Who stumbles[q] (i.e. falls away from the walk of faith; falls into sin; is 
overcome by temptation; stops following God), and I’m not raving over it?
          
30|If there has to be proud talk about tremendous things which have taken place, 
I’ll speak proudly about things that have to do with my weakness (i.e., circumstances in 
which I lacked the power in my own self to overcome the difficulties I faced). 

31|The God and Father of our Lord Jesus—He Who’s blessed forevermore—knows 
for a fact that I’m not lying— 
32|In Damascus the governor under King Aretas kept 
the entire city of Damascus on alert searching for me in order to arrest me, 
*[a]I dote over zealously…Also: I’m jealous
*[b]man…Also: husband
*[c]simplicity…Same word used in 9:11; ref. back to that usage
*[d]receive…Paul uses two different Gk. words for receive [lambanō, (λαμβάνω/Strong’s 2983) and 
dechomai, (δέχομαι/Strong’s 1209)] in this clause; the subtle distinction between the two can be 
gleaned from the usage here.
*[e]speaking ability and rhetoric…Lit: the word
*[f]in every possible way…Lit: in every way in all things
*[g]made to stand on two legs…Lit: be exalted
*[h]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[i]Christ in me unequivocally indicates that this is true…Lit: It is a truth of Christ in me
*[j]I won’t be denied the opportunity to speak with pride about what we will accomplish in the Lord in the 
region of Achaia…Lit: the very boast won’t be stifled to me in the region of Achaia. Assumption is that 
the boasting Paul speaks of refers to 10:17.
*[k]everyone will come to the conclusion…Lit: it will be discovered
*[l]The way it ends for these false apostles will be in step with their deeds…Lit: To whom the end will be 
according to their works

*[p]was cold because I had nothing to wear…Lit: in cold and nakedness. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 
3:11.
*[q]stumbles…Ref. note of Matt. 18:9

*[A]tolerate what the fools spout off treating them like they’re sensible and wise…Lit: tolerate the fools 
being sensible. There’s ambiguity as to what the antecedent of the participle phrase being sensible 
refers to. Who’s Paul saying is sensible, the Corinthians or the fools (the false apostles)? It appears the 
latter is the case. But this is not an isolated case in the NT where there’s such antecedent-ambiguity 
with a participle phrase (and participle phrases dangle by nature). English has this problem also, but it’s 
more acute in Gk.
[B]subjugates and oppresses you, if he cheats you out of house and home, if he sets you up to take 
advantage of you, if he lifts himself up in arrogance, if he slaps you upside the head…Lit: if someone 
enslaves; if someone devours [ref. Mark 12:40]; if someone catches [like a hunter]; if someone lifts up; if 
someone hits to the face. These are hyperboles to a greater or lesser extent.

1|To talk with pride about some spectacular things that have happened to me[a] 
must be done here. While this won’t help anyone, I’ll jump into[b] visions and revelations 
of the Lord anyways. 
2|From firsthand experience, I know of a man in Christ fourteen 
years earlier, and said-person was seized and carried off (whether he was carried off 
outside of the body or whether both his body and his spirit together were carried off, I don’t 
know—only God knows) until he reached the third heaven[A] (i.e., went through the first 
and second heavens, which are the sky, the upper atmosphere, and outer space, into the 
spirit world: “paradise”). 
3|And I know said-person (whether in the body or apart 
from the body, I don’t know—only God knows), 
4|that he was seized and carried off 
into paradise and heard remarks that must not be told, that are not allowed to be 
spoken to a person.
          
5|I’ll talk big on behalf of said-man and talk about the spectacular things that 
happened to him, but I won’t talk big about myself except in the weaknesses I’m beset 
with. 
6|You see, if I were to want to talk big, I won’t be acting like a fool as I talk: in 
fact, I’d be telling the truth. But I’ll spare you, lest someone make incorrect 
assumptions[c] based on what he sees or hears that comes from me 
7|and by means of 
the extraordinary nature of the revelations.
      With this in mind, so that I not be lifted up and over[B] (i.e., leap over the hurdles 
of life), a “thorn in the flesh”[C] (an idiom referring to an antagonist which vexes and harasses 
continuously) was given to me, an agent[d] of Satan, so that he would buffet me (i.e., 
strike me repeatedly and non-stop), so that I not be lifted up and over. 
8|Because of 
this I begged the Lord three times that it be taken away from me, 
9|and he told me,

My grace which I give to you is sufficient,
For the power which accompanies it
Is brought to completion in weakness[D]

          
10|In light of this, I’m content in weakness, with insults, in dire need, with 
persecutions, and in distress on behalf of Christ: for when I’m weak, then I’m powerful 
and capable.
          
11|I’ve turned into a fool; you drove me to it. The fact of the matter is that 
you ought to have a high opinion of me[e]. I’m not deficient in any category when 
compared to the apostles as a whole, you see, even though I’m nothing. 
12|Indeed, 
the defining characteristics of an apostle[E] were thoroughly put into action among you 
with steadfastness and perseverance at every turn, and with signs and wonders (i.e., 
spectacular, attention-getting miracles) and supernatural power. 
13|In fact how 
have you been treated worse than any of the other churches, except that I didn’t wear 
out my welcome[f] with you? Excuse this bad behavior on my part.
          
14|Hey, this is the third time I’ve made preparations to go visit you, and I’ll 
not wear out my welcome: I’m not trying to get your material possessions, I’m trying to 
get you instead. You see, the children in the family aren’t obligated to pay for[g] their 
parents when it comes to room, board, clothing, etc., but the parents are for their children. 

15|I will most gladly spend on you—you who are vivacious in thought and 
emotion[h]—and be spent for you…although the more I love you, the less I’m loved.
          
16|But I’ll let that be. I wasn’t a burden to you; instead—the clever fellow 
that I am—I pulled a fast one on you[i]. 
17|Of all the people I sent you, whom did I 
try to use to take advantage of you with and milk you for gain? 
18|I asked Titus to 
visit you and the comrade who went with him to accompany him—did Titus take 
advantage of you? Have we not conducted our lives in the same spirit (i.e., in the same 
attitude, led by the same prevailing demeanor)? Have we not followed in the same 
footsteps?
          
19|So far you think we’ve just been telling you one excuse after another. But 
what we tell you, we speak before God in Christ (i.e., knowing that God is listening 
closely, while relying on Christ to mediate); every last thing we do is for your 
edification, my dear comrades. 
20|The fact of the matters is that I’m afraid that 
somehow I’ll come visit you and find that you’re not the way that I want and expect you 
to be, and vice-versa; that somehow I’ll find there’s rivalry, jealousy, uncontrolled 
tempers, selfish ambition, bad-mouthing, gossip, arrogance, or havoc being wreaked. 

*[a]To talk with pride about some of the spectacular things that have happened to me…Lit: to be boasting
*[b]I’ll jump into…Lit: I’ll come unto [or into]. Appears to be an expression.
*[c]make incorrect assumptions…Lit: figure; reckon; credit to someone
*[d]agent…Also: angel. See usage in Luke 9:52; Rev. 2:1.
*[e]a high opinion of me…Lit: to be commend by you
*[f]wear out my welcome…Lit: didn’t grow completely stiff or numb; wasn’t a burden
*[g]to pay for…Lit: be storing provisions. Like storing provisions in anticipation of winter.
*[h]on you—you who are vivacious in thought and emotion…Lit: on behalf of your souls
*[i]the clever fellow that I am—I pulled a fast one on you…Lit: being cunning, in deceit I have taken you
*[j]mourn much…Ref. Matt. 5:4; 1 Cor. 5:2

*[A]the third heaven…The ancients had a different view of the universe than we do, and they assumed that 
the spiritual world, which includes heaven itself, is simply a layer on top of another layer. So the Gk. 
word for heaven conflates a couple of concepts we do not. The first of the “heavens” is the sky above. 
The second heaven-layer, being above that of course, is where the sun, the moon, and the stars exist. 
We call it outer-space, but they assumed that these astronomical objects were closer to the earth than 
they actually are. They assumed that the sun travelled across the sky each day in the second “heaven.” 
So the third heaven is the layer above the second, but since the second includes all physical objects (and 
from our perspective extends to the far reaches of the universe), the third layer steps into the spirit-
world. Now, is this spirit-world heaven as we know it? Paul calls it paradise in v.4, so it may be. Ref. 
notes of John 3:3; 1 Pet. 1:5.
*[B]be lifted up and over…This is rendered word-for-word. It’s used as a metaphor.
*[C]”thorn in the flesh”…This is an idiom from the OT, appearing in Num. 23:55; Josh. 23:13; Judg. 2:3; 
Ezek. 28:24. Since it is an idiom, it should not be taken literally; and indeed, it is not used literally in any 
of the aforementioned references. This idiom was originally used to describe the vexation which came 
from the enemy nations which surrounded Israel. In fact, Paul goes on to state exactly what this idiom 
refers to in an appositive phrase a few words after: it is an “agent of Satan.” Furthermore, this verse 
doesn’t say that God gave Paul a thorn in the flesh, rather the passive voice of “was given” is used, 
thereby not specifying the subject, the one doing the giving.
*[D]weakness…Lit: asthenia (the Gk. word for weakness). Asthenia (ἀσθένεια/Strong’s 769)at times means 
sickness (Luke 10:9 for example), but at other times means weakness as the English word suggests. 
When asthenia is used to mean sickness, it refers to a prolonged, undiagnosed ailment which lasts for a 
long time and causes a person to become weak. The context determines whether this refers to a 
physical ailment or not. In addition, asthenia is used a few times starting from the 10th chapter until this 
verse, and nowhere in those occurrences does it conclusively refer to a sickness of some sort. To cap it 
off, v. 10 says “for when I’m weak,” where “weak” summarizes the words before it, which are “insults, 
dire need, persecutions, and circumstances of distress”—none of which are a sickness of any sort. This 
implies that the insults, dire need, persecutions, and circumstances of distress are Paul’s weakness.
[E]the defining characteristics of an apostle…Lit: the signs of an apostle. Although this translation often 
renders apostle as missionary, the complete definition of an apostle also includes what Paul says here, 
namely that a true apostle performs signs and wonders. Likewise, to be considered an evangelist 
according to the strictest biblical definition, one must perform miracles, healings, or something of a 
supernatural nature. This is because Philip (Acts 21:8) is the only evangelist that the NT identifies by 
name, so his example must serve as the archetype for all evangelists. In other words, since Philip 
performed miracles, and Philip is the only evangelist in the Bible, all evangelists must perform miracles 
in order to conform to the strictest definition laid down by Acts 21.

21|I don’t want to have to go there again and have God humiliate me with you and 
cause me to mourn much[j] (i.e., to pray deep, heart-felt prayers of grieving and sorrow; 
to be in a melancholy state of grief, pain, and sorrow) over sins you have previously 
committed and have no intention of asking God to forgive you of these things and 
quitting them—you have no intention of doing anything about them—when it comes to 
the uncleanness (i.e., lewd, crude, disgusting behavior), fornication (i.e., loose sexual 
morals), and licentiousness (i.e., unrestrained indulgence in immoral, physical 
pleasures) which you have practiced.


&COR2 13
1|This’ll be the third time I’ll visit you.

Based upon what’s spoken from the mouth
Of two or[a] better yet three witnesses
Will every affair in question be settled[b]

          
2|I have said earlier and am telling those who’ve sinned up to now and 
everyone else for future reference (and telling them as though I’m present for the second 
time and leaving just now) that if I were to go see you another time, I won’t hold 
anything back, 
3|since you’re looking for proof of Christ speaking in me—Christ who 
isn’t weak when it comes to you[c], but rather is able, capable, and powerful in you. 

4|The fact of the matter is, he was crucified out of weakness, but he lives out of power 
from God. The fact of the matter is, even we are weak in him, but we shall live jointly 
with him out of the power of God granted to you.
          
5|If you are in the Faith, test for yourselves—prove to yourselves this: don’t 
you recognize as far as your own selves are concerned—don’t you know full-well that 
Christ Jesus is in you and among you?—Unless of course you fail the test. 
6|But I 
hope you’ll come to recognize that we don’t fail the test.
          
7|We pray to God for you to no longer do this or that thing which is bad—not so 
that everyone would see that we were right all along, but that you would do what’s 
good instead. 
8|You see, we don’t have the strength to do a thing contrary to the 
truth, but instead we only have the strength to do a thing for the truth. 
9|You see, we 
rejoice when we happen to be weak, but you happen to have strength. This is what we 
pray in addition: we pray for you to reach maturity.
          
10|Because of this, I write these words while absent, so that when I get there 
and am staying with you, I won’t be using the authority which the Lord assigned to me 
in a harsh manner, an authority which is to be used for edification and not is to be used 
destructively.
          
11|One last thing, comrades[d]: rejoice, mend your ways, be comforted and 
encouraged, stay in agreement[e], live in peace, and the God of that wonderful, peaceful 
love[f] will be with you.
          
12|Give each other a holy hug[g] from me.
      All the saints (i.e., your fellow believers in all the churches) greet you.
          
*[a]or…Lit: and
*[b]settled…Lit: established
*[c]isn’t weak when it comes to you…Lit: isn’t weak unto you
*[d]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[e]stay in agreement…Lit: be thinking the same thing

[g]holy hug…Lit: holy kiss. Liberties taken.


Galatians
       After Paul’s usual long-winded introduction, he curtly states the reason he’s writing, namely that 
the Galatians have abandoned the Gospel for some other gospel. This is the subject of the book. The 
issue at hand was whether a person could believe in Jesus directly without the additional constraint of 
becoming Jewish and following all the requirements found in the Law of Moses. An important aspect of 
Paul’s message was that one could believe in Jesus and remain a Gentile. This in fact is the definition of 
Christianity as qualified by the New Testament, and equipped with this teaching, Paul went about 
spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.
       But there remained a faction of Jews who, though they accepted Jesus as the Messiah and 
believed in him, insisted that adherence to the practices of Judaism was necessary, and therefore 
rejected Christianity as defined as believing in Jesus without having to follow Jewish practices. The Book 
of Galatians is Paul refuting and thwarting this heresy. Had he not done so, Christianity as we know it 
might have died off in the first century.
       Galatians is Paul’s thesis of why the Gentiles have access to the promises of God, and not just 
the Jews. Paul demonstrates that this was God’s plan all along, that the Old Testament promises that 
this will one day take place, that faith is—and always was—the key to accessing justification, that the 
Law of Moses is just one step in God’s long-term plan for mankind, that it was at best a stop-gap 
anyways and at worst an obstacle if approached apart from faith. If Judaism were a house, then 
Christianity would be an addition built on top of it.
       Most of the Greek text is simpler than—say—2 Corinthians, about on par with Romans, but 
there a few passages which are tricky (4:12–16 for one). The subject material can be difficult to grasp, 
but once understood, it comes together into a nice, logical framework.

13|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of 
the Holy Spirit be with you all.


&GAL 1
1|From the Apostle (i.e., missionary; pioneer of new churches; worker of 
miracles[a]) Paul, who’s not an apostle created from human agency nor an apostle who 
exists through human agency but through Jesus Christ and God, the Father Who raised 
him from the dead, 
2|and from those who are together with me—not just physically 
but are joint participants in my endeavors—namely all of the comrades[b]:
      To the churches of Galatia:
          
3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 

4|who gave his own self for our sins, and gave himself so he could yank us out of this 
evil day-and-age we live in, according to the will of our God and Father: 
5|to Him be 
the glory forever and ever (and let us pause a moment for that to sink in[c]):
          
6|I’m astounded that you’re setting aside and replacing the Gospel (i.e., the good-
news message we preach) which came from the One Who called us (i.e., summoned us to 
believe) by the grace of Christ in exchange for another so-called gospel— 
7|not that 
there’s another gospel to be had—but I’m astounded at how this could possibly happen except 
for the fact that there are certain individuals among you who are trouble-makers, 
wanting to distort the Gospel, the message of what Christ did. 
8|Never mind that for 
a moment: if even we or an angel who came down from heaven were to evangelize to you 
something different than what we evangelized to you, let him be accursed. 
9|I said it 
before and I’ll say it again: if someone evangelizes you with something different than 
what you received and took to heart already, let him be accursed.
          
10|Furthermore, am I trying to win people or God over to my side now? Or 
am I just trying to please people? If I was still going about pleasing people, I wouldn’t 
be a slave of Christ.
          
11|Just to let you know, comrades, the Gospel which was evangelized by 
me: it’s not a man-made contrivance[d], 
12|nor were we taught it by anyone, but 
rather we were taught it through a Jesus Christ-revelation.
          
13|In fact, you heard about the way I used to live back then when I lived as 
a strict Jew, that I was caught up in persecuting God’s church to an inordinate degree 
and in wreaking havoc on it, 
14|and I was getting deeper and deeper[e] into the 
stricter practices of Judaism, well beyond many of my peers, as I had become even more 
fanatical about all the man-made rules and regulations that were passed down to me 
from my ancestors. 
15|But when God, Who set me apart from the time I was in my 
mother’s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased 
16|to reveal His son 
in me so I’d evangelize him to the Gentiles, I didn’t drop everything I was doing and 
see what the experts had to say about it[f], 
17|nor did I go down[g] to Jerusalem to 
secure the approval of the founding apostles[A], who are my superiors by default, but went 
over to Arabia instead and returned to Damascus.
          
18|Then after three years I went down to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed 
with him for fifteen days. 
19|But I didn’t see the other apostles except for the 
Lord’s brother James. 
20|(What I’m writing here for you—look—I swear to God 
I’m not lying.) 
21|Then I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia. 
22|But I had 
no direct interaction or encounter with[h] the special assemblies[i] of Judea who are in 
Christ, 
23|and the only information they had about me was that they kept hearing that 
the guy who was persecuting them before is now evangelizing the Faith which he was 
wreaking havoc on, 
*[a]worker of miracles…Ref. 2 Cor. 12:12
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]and let us pause a moment for that to sink in…Lit: amen. Ref. note of Rev. 19:4.
*[d]man-made contrivance…Lit: according to man
*[e]deeper and deeper…Lit: more advanced
*[f]see what the experts had to say about it…Lit: consult with flesh and blood. Flesh and blood is a NT 
idiom (ref. Matt. 16:17; 1 Cor. 15:50), and it refers to the best that human reasoning, ability, etc. can 
bring to bear on the issue at hand.

*[i]special assemblies…Lit: churches. Using the literal meaning of church, which is those who are called 
out, as Paul seems to think there are other “special congregations” of those who aren’t believers in 
Christ.

[A]the founding apostles…Lit: those who were apostles before me. In ancient Jewish culture, the default 
leadership structure was one of seniority, hence the elders of the Sanhedrin. In keeping with this, the 
original apostles would outrank Paul in seniority, and by this human reasoning, Paul should’ve submitted 
to them. But that wasn’t God’s plan.

&GAL 2
1|Then after spending fourteen years away, I went back down to Jerusalem 
with Barnabas, taking Titus along as well. 
2|I went down there to discuss my 
conformance to a revelation, and laid out in front of them the glad-tidings message—the 
Gospel—which I preach among the Gentiles. But I submitted this in private to those 
who’re considered to be the leading figures of the movement, lest somehow all of this be a 
huge waste of time on my part[a]—and has been all along. 
3|No, uh-uh—not even my 
companion Titus was required to be circumcised (the act of circumcision being the 
initiation rite whereby one adopts Judaism as his own religion and begins following its myriad 
rules and traditions), seeing that he’s Greek (i.e., a Westerner, far from being Jewish).
          
4|But because of the bogus comrades[b] who infiltrated our movement, those in 
particular who slipped in under the radar to gain intelligence about the freedom which 
we possess in Christ Jesus, those whose aim is to enslave us— 
5|We didn’t knuckle 
under[c] to them for even a moment[d], so that the truth of the Gospel remain in effect 
with us. 
6|But the decision from those who are considered to be of some importance—
just how important they were makes no difference to me: God doesn’t give a hoot about 
a person’s status, outward appearance, or public persona[e]—in fact, the important 
people don’t score any points with me simply because they’re “important”…
          
7|—Enough of that.
      On the contrary seeing that I had been entrusted with the Gospel of 
uncircumcision (i.e., the glad-tidings message that one can come to God through Christ 
as a Gentile without converting to Judaism and without following the Jewish rules and 
traditions) just as Peter[A] was entrusted with the Gospel of circumcision (i.e., the glad-
tidings message to the Jews that the Messiah promised by the Old Testament has come 
in the person of Jesus Christ), 
8|and in this regard he who’s been active in Peter for 
him to be an apostle of the circumcised is also active for me to be the same to the Gentiles. 

9|Recognizing and understanding the grace (i.e., the special gift and calling given to 
me, and not earned by me) that was given to me, James, Peter, and John (those 
considered to be the key players and head honchos[f]) were in total agreement with us 
giving their unequivocal endorsement and full support[g] to me and Barnabas, so that 
we would continue as apostles to the Gentile and they to the circumcised (i.e., the Jews). 

10|They only asked that we remember the poor, the very same thing I too had been 
eager to get done.
          
11|Now when Peter came to Antioch, I confronted him point-blank because 
he was in the wrong. 
12|You see, prior to when select individuals from the churches 
under James’s authority arrived, he partook of meals with the Gentiles, but when they 
arrived, he withdrew from the Gentiles and kept himself at a distance from them[B], fearing 
those from the circumcision (i.e., those who believe that one must obey the Law of 
Moses and adopt Jewish rules and restrictions in order to be accepted by God; those 
who say that believing in Christ but not following the Law is not acceptable to God). 

13|The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was caught 
up[h] in the hypocrisy…
          
14|—Not a chance.
      When I saw that he was disingenuous about the truth of the Gospel, I told Peter 
in front of everybody, “If you being a Jew live as a Gentile and not as a Jew, how can 
you get away with[i] requiring that the Gentiles be Jewish?”
          
15|”We ourselves are Jews by nature and not sinners from far-away, Gentile 
nations[C], 
16|having reached the point where we know for certain that a person 
isn’t justified (i.e., God examining a person’s righteousness like a judge would and 
declaring them to be righteous) as a result of works of law (i.e., obeying the 
commandments of the Law of Moses, or following the do’s and don’ts of any godly list 
of rules for that matter) if it happens to not be through Christ Jesus-faith. We believed in 
Christ Jesus so that we would be justified as a result of Christ-faith and not as a result of 
works of law, since all flesh (i.e., any human endeavor and all human effort apart from 
God) won’t be justified as a result of works of law. 
17|But if in the process of 
seeking justification in Christ, it’s been determined that even we are sinners, you can’t 
seriously believe that Christ has been delegated the responsibility of caring for and 
promoting sin[D]?—No way[j].
          
18|”Furthermore, if I rebuild the things that I demolished, I demonstrate 
conclusively that I’m a transgressor. 
19|You see, because of law I died to law (i.e., 
because of the failure in trying to live up to the requirements of the Law of Moses—
which can be said of any set of rules and not just the Law of Moses—and thereby 
earning righteousness, I ceased all attempts and completely severed myself from 
earning righteousness through the Law), so that I would live to God. I’ve been crucified 
in unison, in joint participation, with Christ; 
20|I no longer live, but Christ lives in 
me. What I now live in flesh (i.e., in my physical body, with my human ability, and in 
contention with my carnal nature), I live by faith for the son of God who loved me and 
gave himself for me. 
*[a]all of this be a huge waste of time on my part…Lit: I am running in vain. An expression.
*[b]bogus comrades…Lit: false brothers
*[c]knuckle under…Lit: yield in subjection; yield meekly
*[d]for even a moment…Lit: with an hour. Ref. note of Matt. 26:40.
*[e]God doesn’t give a hoot about a person’s status, outward appearance, or public persona…Lit: God 
doesn’t receive [take to heart] the face of a man
*[f]key players and head honchos…Lit: pillars

right hand of fellowship. An idiom.
*[h]caught up…Lit: lead away with them
*[i]how can you get away with…Lit: how do you
*[j]no way…Lit: let it not happen

*[A]Peter…Note that in the GT Paul refers to him as Cephas in 1:18, but here and in v. 8 also he’s referred 
to as Petros (Peter); in vv. 9,11 he’s Cephas again. Paul’s use of the name Petros over Cephas is his 
acknowledgement of the authority given to him by Jesus himself, as he’s using the name Jesus gave to 
him. Paul’s use of Cephas is the recognition that Peter is a human like everyone else.
*[B]withdrew from the Gentiles and kept himself at a distance from them…Jews were forbidden to mingle 
with Gentiles. He was a hypocrite because he had been sharing meals with the Gentiles prior to that.
*[C]sinners from far-away, Gentile nations…The assumption among Jews was that anyone who wasn’t 
Jewish was a de facto sinner, was unclean (despicable), and had no relationship with God—nor could 
they. Of course, the latter assertion, that a Gentile couldn’t have a relationship with God, is refuted by 
the OT itself in the persons of Rahab and Ruth. What Jesus said in Matt. 15:26 summarizes this 
preconception—but at the same time Jesus makes an exception for the Gentile Canaanite woman on 
account of her faith.
[D]has been delegated the responsibility of caring for and promoting sin…Lit: a deacon of sin. Note the Gk. 
word for deacon is used here and not the Gk. word for servant or slave. A survey of the NT shows that a 
deacon is one who’s been entrusted with an area of responsibility. A servant or slave, on the other hand, 
follows orders.

1|Oh, brainless, short-sighted Galatians, who cast an evil spell over you[a], you 
whom eye-witness accounts of Jesus Christ were previously written for, accounts 
describing his being crucified? 
2|The only thing I want to ascertain from you is this: Did 
you receive the Spirit[A] from the works of law (i.e., following the do’s and don’ts of the 
Law of Moses, or any other list of rules for that matter) or from hearing a particular 
message from the vantage point of faith?
          
3|You’re brainless this way. Having begun in spirit[b] (i.e., living a spiritual life; 
a life where your regenerate, human spirit, one filled with fruit, dominates your carnal 
nature), are you now continuously improving yourselves[c] in flesh (i.e., by your own 
ability apart from God; not living a spiritual life; trying to please God by adhering to the 
Law of Moses, Jewish tradition, or other rules)? 
4|And are you so far off course that you 
suffered living this way for nothing?—If you really was for nothing. 
5|So does he who 
supplies you with the Spirit and makes power (including supernatural power and the 
miraculous) happen in you do so from works of law or from a particular message you 
heard from the vantage point of faith? 
6|It’s just like the Old Testament verse says, 
“Abraham had faith in God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
          
7|You really need to understand that they who live from the vantage point of 
faith—those are the ones who are sons of Abraham (i.e., imitate and duplicate 
Abraham; carry on Abraham’s legacy). 
8|Now the Scriptures anticipated the 
justification (i.e. clearing of one’s record so he’s considered to be righteous) of the 
Gentiles who live from the vantage point of faith—Before it was made widely known, God 
announced the good news to Abraham, telling him that, “In you a blessing will be 
imparted to all the Gentiles,” 
9|so that they who live from the vantage point of faith are 
jointly blessed with Abraham by means of faith. 
10|You see, every last person 
without exception[d] who seeks justification from works of law is subject to a curse 
because of what is written in the Law Moses: 

Cursed is everyone who doesn’t carry through
With accomplishing the doing of everything
Which has been written in the official, authoritative
Version of the Law of Moses[B]

          
11|That no one is justified with God (i.e., has had God officially clear their 
record of wrong-doing and declared them to be righteous) by law (i.e., by an attempt to 
strictly follow the Law of Moses or by any list or rules, code of ethics, etc. for that 
matter) is obvious[e], since the Law of Moses says, “The righteous individual will live from 
the vantage point of faith.” 
12|But the Law of Moses isn’t from the vantage point of 
faith, but instead, “He who does the very things commanded here shall live in them (i.e., 
shall live with the consequences one way or another).” 
13|Christ redeemed us from 
(i.e., got us out from under) the curse of the Law of Moses, having become a curse for us 
(because it’s written, “Everyone who’s hung on a tree is accursed”) 
14|so that the 
blessing of Abraham would appear to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that we’d receive 
the promise of the Spirit through the faith we’re talking about.
          
15|Comrades[f], let me state this in terms of human contractual law. If a 
person has gone ahead and had a will drawn up and has had it signed, witnessed, and 
notarized[g], if he were to die, no one can void it, disregard it, or amend it by tacking an 
addendum onto it. 
16|Now the promises were given to Abraham and to his father-
to-son direct descendant[h]. The Old Testament doesn’t say “and to his direct 
descendants” (in the plural) but “to his direct descendant” (in the singular) instead.
          
17|What I’m getting at is this[i]: A will was drafted, signed, witnessed, and 
notarized by God, one that can’t be invalidated by a law-code which came into being 
430 years after the will was notarized resulting in cancelling the promise. 
18|Along 
these same lines, if the beneficiaries‘ inheritance were to be based on a law-code, then it 
would no longer be based on a promise. But God, in an act of mercy and kindness, has 
granted the inheritance to Abraham by staking it on a promise.
          
19|So where does the Law of Moses fit in to all of this? It was added as an 
agency of grace and mercy which overlooks the transgressions which would inevitably 
occur, until the time when the father-to-son direct descendant happens to arrive, the one 
whom the promise was given to. The Law was ordained, established, and set in order 
through angels and physically carried out by the hand of a priest acting in the role of 
intermediary between man and God. 
20|But the intermediary is not one, but God is 
One[j] (i.e., the intermediary isn’t an incomparable, all-wise, all-encompassing, single-
minded being, one who is the end-all of everything, but God is just that).
          
21|So is the Law of Moses compatible with the promises?—Don’t even think 
such a thought[k]. You see, if a law-code which has the power to make a person alive 
was given, the righteousness we live in would actually be from a law-code. 
22|Not a 
chance—the Scripture locked every last thing[l] down tight under sin so that the promise 
would be given from the vantage point of faith to those who believe in Jesus Christ.
          
23|Before the Faith came, we were kept under guard, locked down with the 
end-goal in mind of the revealing of faith which was on its way, 
24|done in a way 
that the Law of Moses has become our tutor with the end-goal of Christ in mind, so that 
we would be justified from the vantage point of faith. 
25|Now that the Faith has 
come, we are no longer sitting under a tutor.
          
26|The fact is that all of you are sons of God through the Faith which is in 
Christ Jesus. 
27|In fact, without exception every last one of you[d] who’s been 
baptized into Christ (i.e., has fully accepted and been initiated into Christ and the 
Christian faith) has put on Christ like they’ve put on a piece of clothing. 
28|There is 
neither Jew nor Westerner[m], there is neither slave nor person freed from slavery, there 
is neither male nor female, for all of you are in Christ Jesus (i.e., are melded with 
Christ).

Galatians is the baptism in the Holy Spirit, what’s in Acts 8:15, etc. This verse gives insight into how one

master scroll, the agreed-upon definitive copy, the original scroll of an ancient book, in this case the Law 
of Moses. It’s probable that, at least some of the time, it refers to the entire set of the Torah, not just 
one of its five scrolls. There was originally only one copy of the Torah, and as time went by, more copies 
were made, but there was only one copy (the “control copy”) which was considered the authoritative 
one, as the others were potentially flawed to a small degree. In addition to this meaning, book of the 
Law (scroll of the Law) also serves as a figure of speech which emphasizes the accuracy of a verse or 
passage which has been quoted and its authority as having come directly from the hand of God.

Galatians
29|Now if you are derived from[n] Christ, you certainly are father-to-son 
direct descendants of Abraham, heirs according to the guarantee that a promise provides.


&GAL 4
1|This is what I have to say: The heir of a great estate is a minor for a long but 
fixed time interval, and during that time he’s treated no differently than a household slave, 
while at the same time being an owner of the estate. 
2|Anyways, he’s kept under the 
supervision of a governess[a] and a butler until the predetermined-date set by the minor’s 
father. 
3|The same thing applies to us: When we were minors, we were subject to the 
elementary principles of the world (i.e., subject to the premise of God accepting you 
based on how well you follow the list of do’s and don’ts[A]), having reached the point 
where we were enslaved. 
4|But when the interval was up, God sent His son forth and 
from out of a woman he appeared into this world, and once he appeared he was 
subjected to a set of dictates in the form of the Law of Moses, 
5|so that he would 
redeem those (i.e., get them out from under) who are subjected to the Law, so that he 
would assume[b] the authority and privileges entailed upon a son when he reaches 
adulthood. 
6|Since you’re sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his son into our hearts 
crying, “Papa[c], Father!”, 
7|so that one[d] is no longer a slave but a son; and if such 
person is a son, then he too is an heir through God.
          
8|Anyways, having not reached the point back then where you had a first-
hand knowledge of God, as slaves you served things that don’t have God-like 
characteristics by nature. 
9|But knowing God now (or more accurately, being known 
by God) how is that you’re once again directing your main focus to the weak and poor 
elementary principles which you want to serve again from the top down? 
10|You 
observe special religious days, seasons, and years that the Law of Moses says are mandatory. 

11|I’m worried[e] that all the hard work I invested in you was somehow for 
nothing.
          
12|Put yourselves in my shoes, since I’m putting myself in your shoes, 
comrades[C]; I’m asking you to do this. You didn’t do me any wrong or cause me any 
harm. 
13|But you know for a fact that I evangelized the Gospel to you a while back 
through the weakness of the flesh (i.e., engulfed in the limitations inherent in all 
humans), 
14|and you didn’t despise nor disdain your testing[D] in my flesh (i.e., it 
wasn’t beneath you to see if I would break under pressure while being pushed to the 
limits of my human abilities). That aside, you received me as though I were an angel of 
God, as though I were Christ Jesus. 
15|So where is your blessing (i.e., why aren’t 
you wishing us well anymore)? In fact, I swear I’m telling you the truth, because, if 
possible, you plucked out your eyes and gave them to me[E] (i.e., because, had it been 
possible, you would’ve forced me to agree with your point of view). 
16|So this 
means that I’ve become your enemy by telling you the truth?
          
17|Those who are spreading heresy among you are eager to convert you, but 
they’re up to no good. Forget that—they wish to prevent you from[f] believing in the 
truth, so that you would be their devotees, their fan-boys. 
18|But it’s always good 
to be eagerly sought after to be converted in a positive way, and not just when I’m with 
you in person, 
19|my children, concerning whom I suffer labor pains again until 
such time that Christ be formed in you. 
20|I kept wanting just now to be with you 
in person and discover something about you which would cause me to change my tone of 
voice when addressing you, since I don’t know what to make of you.
          
21|Tell me, you who are wanting to follow the dictates of the Law of Moses: 
haven’t you heard what the Law teaches[g]? 
22|You see, it’s recorded in the Law that 
Abraham had two sons, one from the female-slave and one from the free woman. 

23|Anyways, on the one hand he[h] who was birthed from the female-slave was 
according to flesh (i.e., was brought into the world through Abraham’s human ability 
apart from God), but on the other hand he who was birthed from the free woman was 
brought into the world through the guarantee that a promise provides.
          
24|These women are allegories: these women are two covenants. One 
originated from Mt. Sinai was born into slavery and is personified by Hagar. 
25|But 
Hagar/Mt. Sinai is in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem; she—
Jerusalem—is serving as a slave along with the carbon-copies of herself which she’s 
spawned[i].
          
26|Now the Jerusalem above[F], who’s our mother, the one who’s spawned 
us[j], is free. 
27|In this regard, it’s written,

Rejoice, barren woman, who isn’t birthing children—
Let loose and cry out,
You woman who isn’t suffering labor pains,
Since the children of the free woman
Are more numerous
Than the one who has
Garnered the attention of the husband

          
28|But you, comrades, are children derived from promise according to the 
precedent set with Isaac. 
29|That aside, just as it was back then, that he who was 
born into this world according to flesh (i.e., according to a human attempt to 
accomplish something apart from God) persecuted he who was born into this world 
according to the Spirit, it’s the same way now. 
30|Anyways, what does the Bible 
have to say about this?

Kick the female-servant and her son to the curb.
Fact is, there’s not a chance at all
That the son of the female-servant
Will split the inheritance
With the son of the free woman.

          
*[a]governess…Lit: guardian. Some liberties taken.
*[b]assume…Lit: take from another
*[c]Papa…Lit: Abba. Ref. note of Rom. 8:15.
*[d]one…Lit: you (singular). Paul always uses the plural form (an example is in v.6) of you in his letters 
when referring to the Galatians, Corinthians, etc. And also, Paul sometimes uses you (singular) as one, as 
it is in this case.
*[e]worried…Lit: fear
*[f]prevent you …Lit: lock you out of
*[g]haven’t you heard what the Law teaches…Lit: you didn’t hear the Law
*[h]he…Lit: it or that. It’s commonplace for nouns describing children or infants to be neuter rather than 
masculine.
*[i]the carbon-copies of herself which she’s spawned…Lit: her children
*[j]the one who’s spawned us…Lit: who’s our mother

*[A]subject to the prevalent idea of God accepting you based on how well you follow the list of do’s and 
don’ts…This phrase elementary principles is used here and also in Col 2:8,20. The meaning of elementary 
principles should be determined by the context of its appearances in the NT.
*[B]the authority and privileges entailed upon a son when he reaches adulthood…The Gk. word for this is 
usually translated adoption but literally means son-placement. In this context, it’s referring to Jesus 
coming into the rights and privileges which were reserved for him. This passage starting from v. 1 draws 
an analogy between a child who is born the son of the lord of a great estate but is raised no differently 
than a household slave. Once he reaches an age of maturity, he joins his father and becomes a joint-
owner of the estate. Jesus underwent this process by being born into this world and having to live under 
the dictates of the Law—but only for a fixed time interval. The interval expired when he was raised from 
the dead. At that time he assumed his full privileges as Son of God. This is also what Heb. 1:5 refers to.
*[C]Put yourselves in my shoes, since I’m putting myself in your shoes, comrades…Lit: become as me, since I 
become as you, brothers. I’m guessing that this is what Paul meant. Same applies for the next few 
verses.
*[D]your testing…Or: your temptation. Though some manuscripts read my testing instead, the consensus 
favors the former over the latter. The redacting of the manuscripts in this area goes to show how 
difficult vv. 12–16 are to make sense of.
*[E]because, if possible, you plucked out your eyes and gave them to me…Some claim that the “weakness 
of the flesh” Paul spoke about in v. 13 was a seeing disorder, and that the Galatians wanted to pluck out 
their eyes and give them to Paul out of sympathy. As difficult as the passage of vv. 12–16 is to interpret, 
a healthy skepticism is in order. But the context of this passage doesn’t confirm this dubious claim. 
Verse 15 begins, “why aren’t you happy anymore?”, while verse 16 begins, “So this means I’ve become 
your enemy…?” No concurrence is found ; the context suggests that this is an idiom.
[F]Jerusalem above…Paul refers to a concept, also called the New Jerusalem, which has its origins in the 
OT, in Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Isaiah, and appears in the NT in Rev. 21:12. In the Bible, cities are 
metonymies for a concentration of those who intensely believe and put into practice a particular 
doctrine, religion, etc. The present-day Jerusalem of v. 25 is a metonymy for those who expect to obtain 
righteousness by adhering to the Law, whereas the Jerusalem above represents righteousness through 
faith in Christ.

&GAL 5
1|Christ set us free by means of the freedom of the Spirit, so make your stand 
and don’t be subject to a yoke of bondage again. 
2|See here: I—Paul—tell you, if you 
were to be circumcised (i.e., if you were to commit yourselves to following the Law of 
Moses and seek righteousness from God based on your adherence to it), Christ won’t 
benefit you in any way. 
3|Again, I swear I’m telling the truth as I solemnly declare to 
every circumcised person (i.e., every person who’s attempting to earn righteousness by 
following the Law) that there’s an obligation to put into practice every aspect, every 
mandate, every requirement, and every last proscription of the Law. 
4|You’ve been 
split off from Christ and have had all ties with him severed, you the very people who 
expect justification[a] by following a code of law; you fell out of grace. 
5|You see, we in 
spirit[b] (i.e., our human spirit in communion with the Holy Spirit) from a perspective of 
faith eagerly await a hope of righteousness. 
6|You see, in Christ Jesus circumcision 
(i.e., committed to following the Law) isn’t a factor that carries any weight[c] nor is 
uncircumcision (i.e., not committed to following the Law), but rather faith in action 
through love.
          
7|You were on the right track—who derailed you to where you became 
unconvinced of and disobedient to the truth? 
8|Whatever form of persuasion this 
manifested itself as[d] is not from Him Who called you (i.e., from God who summoned 
you to believe in Him). 
9|Just a tiny amount of yeast will spread to the entire batch of 
dough, converting all the dough to yeast. 
10|I’m satisfied in the Lord that you 
won’t arrive at any other conclusion than the truth, but the troublemaker who’s causing 
you problems will suffer the consequences[e], whoever he happens to be. 
11|But in 
my case, comrades—if I happened to still be preaching circumcision (i.e., preaching that 
one must obey the Law of Moses and seek righteousness by following it), why would I 
continue to be persecuted? Has the point of contention and the offensiveness[f] of the 
cross really been abolished? 
12|Would that those who are agitating you go on to be 
castrated![A]
          
13|The fact of the matter is that you were called (i.e., became believers) to be 
at a place of freedom, comrades: just don’t turn the freedom in Christ into a pretext for 
flesh (i.e., a pretext to act apart from God or to indulge your carnal nature), but serve 
one another as slaves through the love God has put in us instead. 
14|You see, the 
entirety of what the Law teaches is summarized in one sentence: “You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself”; 
15|but if you’re vicious towards one another, aggressive, 
and take advantage of each other or have total disregard for each other, be careful that 
you don’t rip each other to shreds.
          
16|I’ll say this: conduct your lives[h] in a spiritual manner[b] (i.e., by your 
spirit in communion with the Holy Spirit) and you won’t carry out the desires of the 
flesh (i.e., the carnal nature)—not a chance. 
17|The flesh, you see, has intense, 
sexual-like desires contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit is contrary to the flesh: in fact 
these two are pitted against each other, so that that which you happen to be wanting, 
those are the things you won’t be doing. 
18|But if you are led in a spiritual 
manner[b], you are not under law (i.e., you’re not subordinated to a set of rules to how to 
run your life, in particular to the Law).
          
19|Now the works of the flesh are obvious as they’re out in the open and 
plain for everyone to see: in particular there is fornication (i.e., sexual immorality of any 
sort); uncleanness (i.e., filthy, nasty, disgusting behavior of any sort; lewd, crude, crass, 
foul-mouthed, disgusting untidiness, abject neglect of personal hygiene; disgusting 
references to or treatment of bodily functions); licentiousness (i.e., strong, out-of-control 
desire which drives you to do that which is immoral); 
20|idolatry (i.e., replacing 
God with something else; looking for something else to do what God promised He’d do 
for you; taking what God did for you and attributing it to something else); recreational 
drug use, drug abuse, drug dealing, dabbling in the occult, or extreme types of 
manipulation and control[B]; enmity (i.e., animosity; mutual hatred; continual hostility); 
quarrelling and strife; emulation (i.e., rivalry driven by jealousy; envy; competing in an 
unhealthy way to outdo someone else); wrath (i.e., a hot, out-of-control temper; 
unwarranted outbursts of anger); selfish ambition, playing politics, or manipulating 
those around you for your own selfish ends; seditions (i.e., dissensions, unresolved 
disputes); factions (i.e., the formation and perpetuation of groups hostile to each other); 

21|jealousy (i.e., envious of someone else who does well; hatred of someone simply 
because they’re doing well or are good at doing something); drunkenness and out-of-
control drinking; carousing (i.e., loud partying; hell-raising for the fun of it); etc., etc.—I 
told you before and I’ll tell you again[i]: those who do such things will not inherit the 
kingdom of God (i.e., they will have no interaction with God; God will not be involved 
in their lives).
          
22|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness and mercy 
and forgiveness, inner-goodness, faithfulness, 
23|meekness (i.e., a gentleness 
which comes from restraint); no law (i.e., no list of do’s and don’ts) is against such 
things. 
24|But those who are a part of Christ Jesus crucified the flesh (i.e., the carnal 
nature) together with its passions and desires. 
25|If we aspire to live in a spiritual 
manner[b], let us also adhere to standards of a human spirit in communion with the 
Holy Spirit. 
*[a]expect justification…Lit: are justified
*[b]in spirit…in a spiritual manner…Or: in the Spirit. Although there is ambiguity, the lack of the definite

are advocating circumcision would, while being circumcised themselves, have an accident and cut off 
more than just the foreskin.

3|Furthermore, if someone thinks he’s something when he’s nothing, he’s full 
of baloney[c]. 
4|But let each person decide if his own personal conduct is up to a 
satisfactory level, and then he’ll be entitled to speak proudly[d], but only to himself and 
not to somebody else. 
5|In this regard, each person will bear his own load.
          
6|Now have the person who’s having the Word taught to him in a classroom 
environment share all sorts of good things[e] (materially speaking) with the teacher. 

7|Don’t kid yourselves, God won’t let anyone get away with turning his nose up at 
Him or sneering at Him; in this context, what a person sows, this he also reaps, 

8|since the one who sows into his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh he sowed 
into, but he who sows into the Spirit will reap eternal life (i.e., that special fullness of 
life) from the Spirit he sowed into. 
9|But on the other hand, the one who continues to do 
good mustn’t lose heart, for when the time’s right[f] we will reap from the good we’ve sown 
if we don’t grow weary and quit. 
10|So then, while we still have a chance[g], let us 
continue to do good things for everyone, but most of all continue to do good things for the 
households of those who are of the Faith.
          
11|Pay attention to the capital letters[A] I’m using here as I write this in my 
own handwriting:
          
12|THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THEMSELVES APPEAR ON THE 
OUTSIDE AS THOUGH THEY’RE GOOD—THEY’RE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE YOU TO BE 
CIRCUMCISED (i.e., to formally adopt the Law of Moses in the rite of circumcision, 
thereby committing to following it) FOR THE SOLE REASON THAT THEY WON’T BE 
PERSECUTED FOR[h] THE CROSS OF CHRIST. 
13|IN FACT, THOSE WHO PROMOTE 
CIRCUMCISION DON’T EVEN KEEP LAW (i.e., keep the Law of Moses or any code of 
conduct for that matter) THEMSELVES. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WANT YOU TO BE 
CIRCUMCISED SO THEY CAN BRAG IN YOUR FLESH (i.e., can brag about the amount of 
personal effort you’re putting into following the Law).
          
14|But far be it for me to brag or beam with pride except in the cross of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world (i.e., 
the ungodly established order of mankind has completely disavowed and shunned me, 
wanting nothing to do with me, and I have done the same to it). 
15|Neither 
circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any significance, but a new creation is the only 
thing which is significant. 
16|And whosever conforms to this standard: peace be 
upon him and mercy, and may it also be upon God’s people Israel.
          
17|Henceforth, let no one try to hassle me[i], for I bear the marks of Jesus in 
my body as though I’m trudging about carrying a weight.

Ephesians
       This letter Paul wrote to the Ephesians has become a universal favorite of all Christians from all 
denominations who have a genuine relationship with Christ. Reading the first half of the first chapter, 
one immediately sees why Bible studies—in fact, entire seminary courses—are set on this Paul’s letter, 
as, reading it, one is swept away in a whirlwind of the extend of what God did for us in Christ. The 
structure is simple, the same word is often repeated, but it communicates profound thoughts—one 
after another.
       Ephesians runs the gamut of spiritual life. The first couple of chapters of the book are about how 
believers were taken out of sin and given grace beyond their wildest imagination, and will be given even 
more in the ages to come. The last few chapters are advice on living day by day in our present lives, 
followed by the war we wage against the devil. All of it is like a sweet pastry which is best consumed a

1|Paul, apostle (i.e., missionary) of Christ Jesus through the will of God—
      To the saints (i.e., God’s people) who are in Ephesus and to those who are 
faithful[A] in Christ Jesus:
          
2|Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
3|Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, He Who blessed us 
with every spiritual blessing imaginable in the spiritual domain[a] in Christ, 
4|just as in 
love He chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and unblemished 
when subjected to His scrutiny[b], 
5|having determined beforehand that He would 
adopt us, making us His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the benevolent 
thought-process of His will, 
6|resulting in praising the glory of His grace, which in an 
act of mercy and kindness He gave us by means of the Beloved-One, 
7|in whom we 
have the Redemption (i.e., the master-plan to put our lives back to the way they were 
supposed to be) through his blood, the forgiveness of the trespasses which caused us to 
need redemption in the first place, according to the riches of His grace, 
8|which He 
copiously showered on us with every kind of wisdom and thought-process imaginable, 

9|having made known and understood to us the mystery of His will, according to His 
benevolent thoughts which He purposed and put forth openly in him 
10|for the 
management of when the eras of history come to a head[c], resulting in the redefinition[d] 
of every last thing[e] in the Messiah, the Christ, every last thing that resides in the 
spiritual domain and on the Earth—all things in him, 
11|in whom we also received 
an inheritance (i.e., things which have been parceled out and reserved specifically for 
us, and for us only, to receive or walk, spiritual or otherwise. The plan for us to have 
such things is immutable. ) which has been predestined (i.e., decided upon ahead of 
time) according to the plan and purpose of the One who works every last thing 
according to the deliberation of His will, 
12|resulting in us being disposed to praise 
His glory, we who have set our hope in Christ beforehand, 
13|and in whom we 
also, having heard the ultimate message[f] of truth, the Gospel of our salvation (i.e., the 
good news that there is a program in place to rescue us and protect us from calamity), 
in which, now that we have believed this message, we were sealed (i.e., identified as 
belonging to someone or intended for some purpose and labeled and marked as 
genuine as such) by the guaranteed-by-promise Holy Spirit[g], 
14|who is[B] the 
down payment of our inheritance up until we take delivery of what was purchased, 
resulting in praising His glory.
          
15|On account of this, having heard about your expression of the Faith[h], a 
faith which is in the Lord Jesus, and the love which you show to all the saints, 
16|I 
also haven’t stopped offering thanksgiving for you, bringing you up in my prayers[i], 

17|so that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, will give you a 
spirit (i.e., a prevailing attitude; an all-encompassing mindset that reaches down deep 
into the heart, into your own human spirit) of wisdom and revelation in a recognition 
and an arrived-at, more precise knowledge and understanding of Him, 
18|which is 
the eyes of your heart having reached the point where they’re enlightened resulting in 
us knowing for a fact what[j] is the hope of our calling (i.e., what the full potential and 
ramifications are of us being chosen and accepted by God), what is the wealth of the 
glory of His inheritance that’s been distributed among the saints, 
19|and what is the 
over-the-top greatness of His power made available to us, we who believe in accordance 
with the actuation of the might of His strength (i.e., the sheer amount of force He’s able 
to bring to bear when He unleashes his power), 
20|which he actuated in the 
Messiah, the Christ, having raised him from the dead and having seated him at his right 
hand (i.e., having taken his position of God’s chief executive officer) in the spiritual 
domain[a], 
21|superseding by far[k] all rule and authority and power and 
dominion[C] and every name which has been named (i.e., every authority which has ever 
been established; every person or being who’s ever been given or has otherwise 
assumed a position of authority) not just in this age—no—in the Age to Come as well. 

22|And He subjected all things under his feet (i.e. God made all things absolutely 
subservient to Christ, to be forcefully dominated by him), and gave him—the one who’s 
the head over all things—to the church,

&EPH 2
1|And while you were dead (i.e., dead spiritually: in a stagnation of waste, 
joylessness, futility, and destruction) in your trespasses and sins, 
2|in which you went 
about day in, day out[a] back then according to the age (era) of this world (i.e., according 
to the philosophies, attitudes, and beliefs that are in vogue in this particular era of 
human history), according to the ruler of the authority of the air[A] (i.e., according to the 
being who determines the underlying unseen power that influences and guides human 
society), the spirit who now works in those who take it upon themselves to be 
disobedient[b], 
3|you also conducted your lives this way among them back then, living 
by the desires of your flesh (i.e., your carnal nature), acting out the wants of the flesh 
and of the thoughts which randomly enter your mind, and you were by nature 
characterized by indulgence in[c] violent emotions just like everyone else.
          
4|But God, rich in mercy because of the great amount of love which He has, 
loved us, 
5|and we, dead in the trespasses I mentioned earlier, were made alive in 
Christ—by grace you have been saved— 
6|and were raised in conjunction with him 
and seated jointly with him (i.e., given joint authority with him) in the spiritual domain[d] 
in Christ Jesus, 
7|so that the over-the-top riches of His grace in goodness in Christ 
Jesus would be showcased by being lavished upon us in the coming ages. 
8|You see, by 
grace you have been saved through faith, and this grace—the gift of God—does not 
originate from yourselves[B], 
9|it does not originate from works, so that no one would 
have bragging-rights. 
10|You see, we are His handiwork, created in Christ Jesus in 
a position to handle the good works which God has waiting in the wings for us to occupy 
our day-to-day lives with[e].
          
11|In light of this, recall that in flesh (i.e., according to your physical bodies 
which indicate the method and means by which you approach God) you were “the 
Gentile Nations” back then, those called uncircumcised (i.e., not God’s people) by those 
called circumcised in flesh by hand (i.e., God’s people according to a ritual performed 
by humans), 
12|because in that phase of your life[f] you were apart from Christ, 
excluded[g] from the political and social community of Israel and strangers to the 
covenants of promise, hopeless and godless in the world. 
13|But now you are 
melded with[h] Christ Jesus; you being far away back then became close by the blood of 
Christ.
          
14|The fact is, He personally is our peace, who made both peoples into one 
and by means of his flesh tore down the dividing wall—the animus—
15|having 
abolished the wall, namely the Law of Moses which consists of the commandments of God 
enumerated in decrees, so that by means of him He would merge[i] the two entities into 
one new entity[j], making peace by doing so, 
16|and by means of one body would 
reconcile both to God through the cross, having killed the animus by means of him. 

17|And he went and proclaimed the glad-tidings message of peace to us who are 
afar and peace to those who are near, 
18|the message that through him both entities 
have the access I’ve been talking about in one Spirit to the Father.
          
19|So I’ll state this emphatically: you’re no longer strangers and foreign-
residents, but fellow-citizens of the saints and households of God (i.e., God’s people, 
historically speaking) instead,

all the gift of God. The gender of the word this is neuter, agreeing with the gender of gift. The genders of 
grace and faith are both feminine, which means that in the strictest sense this does not refer to faith 
because of the gender disagreement. Many assume that it does and use this verse as proof that faith is a 
gift and that God must give us this gift to “boot us up” so to speak as Christians. Faith is not a gift, 
nowhere in the Bible does it say that faith is a gift, and neither does this verse.

1|Now about grace of this sort: I Paul the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of 
you who are the Gentiles 
2|(assuming you’ve actually heard about the responsibility 
assigned to me to manage the grace of God, grace which was conveyed by me to you), 

3|am telling you that through the agency of[a] revelation the mystery of this grace was 
made known to me just as I briefly wrote about before 
4|for the purpose of you being 
able to think through my understanding of[b] the mystery of Christ by reading what I 
wrote, 
5|a mystery which in other decades and centuries[c] wasn’t made known to the 
average person[d] like it’s now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by means 
of the Spirit, 
6|namely that the Gentiles are to be joint-heirs, to share the same body 
with, and to be joint-partakers of the promise by means of Christ Jesus through the 
Gospel, 
7|which I became a minister of according to the gift of the grace of God which 
was given to me reflective of the actuation of His power.
          
8|This very grace was given to me, the least worthy of any of the saints (i.e., 
those who believe in Christ) to evangelize to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of 
Christ—riches which cannot be tracked like a predator tracks its prey— 
9|and to 
make visible and apparent to anyone and everyone what is the program[e] by which the 
mystery of what has been hidden away in God Who created all things from those who 
lived in the various ages, 
10|so that at the present time the multi-faceted wisdom of 
God would be made known and understood to the demonic rulers and the demonic 
authorities in the spiritual domain[f] through the church, 
11|according to the plan 
and purpose of the ages, which He executed by means of Christ Jesus our Lord, 

12|in whom we have the open, bold, and confident means of access[g] in our having 
reached the point where we’re fully convinced through the faith we have in him. 

13|In light of this I ask that you not lose heart in the deluge of[h] the severe 
difficulties I face for your sake, a thing in particular which focuses on you[i].
          
14|Now back to talking about grace of this sort: I genuflect before the Father, 

15|out of Whom every lineage, be it race, tribe, clan, family, or whatever, in the 
heavens (i.e., the sky above, heaven, and the spiritual domain) and on the earth are 
named (i.e. are assigned their role and authorities), 
16|that, according to the riches 
of His glory, He would grant you to be strengthened with power in the inner-self[j] 
through His Spirit, 
17|for Christ to take up residence through the faith in your 
hearts, while being rooted and anchored[k] in love, 
18|so that you, joined by all the 
saints, would be equal to the task of grasping the sheer magnitude of[l] the width, 
length, height, and depth of this grace, 
19|and to comprehend what’s beyond 
comprehension—the love of Christ—so that you would be filled with the goal of 
reaching[m] all the fullness of God.
          
20|Now to the One Who’s able to do far above and beyond all that we ask or 
think, doing it in lockstep with the power which works in us—

&EPH 4
1|I ask you with all sincerity—I the prisoner in the Lord—to go about your day-
to-day lives in a worthy manner, 
2|with every kind of and the utmost extent of 
humility, gentleness, and self-restraint there is[a], with patience, putting up with one 
another in love, 
3|while being eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of 
the bond of peace— 
4|There is one body of believers and one Spirit of God, just like the 
fact that you were called in one hope of your calling (i.e., you were summoned by God 
to be believers in a summoning that has one and only one hope in mind)— 
5|One 
Lord, one faith, one baptism (i.e. there is only one way to become a Christian, and it is 
done once only)— 
6|One God who occupies the role of Father[A] of all things: namely 
the One Who’s on the top of the heap[b]; Who all things exist on account of Him, by 
means of Him, and through Him; and Who is in, with, and among all things.
          
7|Now the unearned gift which God gives out of His kindness[B] was given to 
each individual according to the specific amount and peculiar characteristics[c] of the gift 
of Christ. 
8|In light of this the Book of Psalms says,

Once he ascended to a high place[C],
He bedazzled the captives[d]—
He gave gifts to the people on Earth


9|Now as a side note, how can he who ascended (i.e., the person referred to by this 
quotation from Psalms) possibly be anyone other than the person who descended into 
the lower part of the Earth (i.e., the world beneath the Earth, the underworld, the place 
where the dead go and where hell is)? 
10|The person who descended is the same 
person referred to in Psalms here who ascended far above all the heavens (i.e., to a 
position which completely supersedes and has complete dominion over the entire 
spiritual domain, including all spiritual creatures and all activity in the spiritual world) 
in order to fully take ownership of[e] all the things that were promised to him.
          
11|And as far as the gifts that were given, this same person—the one who both 
descended and ascended—granted that, some here and some there, there be the apostles, the 
prophets, the evangelists, and the overlapping roles of pastor[f] and instructor[D] (i.e., those 
who do one or more of the following: leading the congregation; instructing the 
congregation as to what the rules are; laying down rules when needed; explaining the 
Scriptures and the Christian faith)— 
12|for the equipping of the saints (i.e., the 
believers) towards the goal of the work of the ministry, towards the goal of the building 
up of the body of Christ, 
13|until—should the time ever come[E]—we all attain the 
unity of the Faith and the recognition and the arrived-at knowledge and understanding 
of the Son of God, with the goal of becoming a full-grown man (i.e., getting our act 
together) to the point where we reach Christ’s height and body-weight[F], 
14|so that 
we’d no longer be young children, jostled and carried about by every wind of teaching 
among the cheap hustles that pool sharks dream up to con people[g]; 
15|but, while 
being straight-up about the truth[h] in a spirit of love, we would grow to the same stature 
as him in all respects, who is the head, 
16|from whom the entire body is being 
assembled into a single, cohesive unit by examining each part, seeing how it logically 
fits into the big picture, then putting the entire unit together—a body which is connected 
through every supporting ligament according to a pattern of operation where each one 
of the members does its share[i] to cause the growth of the body towards the goal of the 
building up of itself in love.
          
17|What I’m telling you—and I swear by it in the Lord—is this: No longer 
go about your day-to-day lives as the Gentiles (i.e., the random people out yonder who 
have no relationship with God; the nations which populate the earth) do in the futile, 
foolish, senseless, and worthless state of their minds, 
18|being darkened in their 
end-to-end thought process, estranged from the life of God on account of the ignorance 
which exists in them and furthermore on account of the state of hardness, dullness, and 
insensitivity of their hearts, 
19|people in particular who, having reached the point 
where they’re so callous that they’re not bothered by the implications of what they do, 
have relinquished control of themselves in their giving of themselves over to an 
unrestrained indulgence in lewd and immoral physical pleasures towards the end-
result of practicing all sorts of[j] filthy, disgusting things[k] in a yearning for more and 
more of the same.
          
20|But you did not learn (i.e., successively come to appreciate and build an 
understanding of) Christ this way, 
21|if you really heard him and were taught by 
him (according to the premise that truth is in Jesus) 
22|to repeatedly put aside the 
old-self[l] in regard to the former lifestyle you used to live, the old-self who’s degenerating 
as a consequence of the carnal desires of “the delusion” we’re all-too familiar with— 

23|but doing this while being renewed in the prevailing attitude and disposition[m] 
of your mind— 
24|and to put on once and for all[G] the new-self, who, as directed by 
God, was created in righteousness and holiness—without fault both from a human and 
from a divine perspective—derived from[n] the truth.
          
25|In light of this, now that you’ve put aside the mendacity that used to be a 
part of your conversation, as Zechariah says, “Each person ought to speak truthfully when 
he’s with his neighbor[o],” since you belong to one another[p]. Psalms says, 
26|“Be 
angry and don’t sin when you are”—don’t let the sun set on your wrath (i.e., be angry 
but don’t be consumed by the emotion, not putting the anger away when you should), 

27|nor give place to the devil (i.e., close off any opportunities for the devil; don’t 
allow him to gain a foothold anywhere). 
28|Let the person who steals no longer 
steal, but rather have him toil, working for the common good using his own hands, so that 
he would have the wherewithal to give to the one in need. 
29|Don’t let any rotten 
word (including ideas and topics of conversation) come out of your mouth, but rather 
let something come out of your mouth that contributes positively to the problem at hand[q], 
so that it would give grace (i.e., it would be a gift of kindness, graciousness, and 
goodwill to those who don’t deserve the same) to those who hear. 
30|And do not 
grieve the Holy Spirit of God or cause him pain, in whom you were sealed (i.e., certified 
and labeled as genuine or as belonging to someone) for a day of redemption (i.e. to a 
point in time where things are made to be what they’re supposed to be or restored to 
what they used to be). 
31|Let any sort of bitterness, rage, anger, shouting, or 
blasphemy (i.e., swearing at someone, trash-talking about someone, smearing or 
slandering the reputation of someone) be removed from you together with any sort of 
malice. 
*[a]with every kind of humility, gentleness, and self-restraint there is…Lit: with all humility and meekness
*[b]on the top of the heap…Lit: upon all [things]
*[c]specific amount and peculiar characteristics…Lit: measure
*[d]he bedazzled the captives…Lit: he took captive the captives. A repetition of the same root, first the 
verb then the noun with not article is a figure of speech, likely an idiom also. This figure of speech 
originates in the Hebrew text of Ps. 68:18 and was simply copied to the LXX, from where it was copied to 
this epistle.
*[e]fully take ownership of…Lit: fulfill
*[f]pastor…Lit: shepherd. Ref. note of 1 Pet. 5:2.
*[g]the cheap hustles that pool sharks dream up to con people…Lit: the cunning [from dice-playing; sleight] 
of men in villainy, knavery, trickery [lit: readiness to do anything] to the scheming [from the root 
method, system; device; scheming; deal craftily with] of deception. Pool sharks is actually dice-throwers 
(liberties taken).
*[h]while being straight-up about the truth…Lit: truth-speaking. Of note is that this is a single Gk. word and 
not a multi-word phrase. Since it is a single word, it has a more specific definition.
*[i]its share…Lit: in a measure
*[j]all sorts of…Lit: all. Same idiom used in 1 Tim. 6:10.
*[k]filthy, disgusting things…Lit: uncleanness
*[l]old-self…Lit: old man [person]
*[m]prevailing attitude and disposition…Lit: spirit
*[n]derived from…Lit: of
*[o]Each person ought to speak truthfully when he’s with his neighbor…Lit: speak truth each one with his 
neighbor. Speak truth is a figure of speech.
*[p]belong to one another…Lit: are a member of one another
*[q]contributes positively to the problem at hand…Lit: is good towards an edification of the need

*[A]One God who occupies the role of Father…Lit: God and Father. An hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11. In 
this case, the hendiadys emphasizes the fact that God is the Supreme Father, and as the Father is the 
One Who is over everything, plans, originates, directs, and gives purpose to everything. This very thing is 
elaborated in the words which follow.
*[B]the unearned gift which God gives out of His kindness…Also: the grace. The definite article precedes 
the word grace when it refers to grace in a Christian context, and not one of the other meanings the Gk. 
word might convey. This is sort-of idiomatic.
The context suggests that this is talking about the special abilities God gives to select individuals to be 
used in the ministry. Note that the word grace in this verse is the root for the word gift (charisma) used 
in 1 Cor. 12,14. Now, the word gift used in v. 7 here in gift of Christ uses the generic word for gift (dōron, 
δῶρον/Strong’s 1435) , which, unlike charisma, has no sense of grace attached to it (ref. note of Rom. 
12:6). But this was probably because dōron was used in Ps. 68:18 in the LXX, which is quoted in v. 8, so 
Paul uses it in reference to this quotation, not because there’s no grace associated with this dōron.
*[C]ascended to a high place…Lit: ascended to high. A few verses later (v. 10) Paul clarifies what high 
means: far above all the heavens. This is not so much a physical location as a position of authority.
*[D]instructor…Also: teacher. Ref. note of Acts 15:1. Also note that there is only one definite article before 
pastor and instructor, whereas apostle, prophet, and evangelist each have their own definite articles. 
The missing definite article before teacher binds it to pastor.
*[E]should the time ever come…This seems to be insinuated by the verb tense of attain, but others (in this 
case, the Expositor’s Greek Testament) claim that the tense of attain “…points to the event [of attaining 
the unity of the faith] as expected, and not as a mere hypothetical possibility.” According to this 
reasoning, should the time ever come would be rendered when the time actually does come instead.
*[F]being a full-grown man (i.e., getting our act together) to the point where we reach Christ’s height and 
body-weight …Lit: to a complete man, to a measure of stature of the fullness of Christ. Complete man is 
the same idiom/metaphor used in James 3:2. The metaphorical sense of this is signaled by the use of the 
more specific Gk. word for man, which is anār (ἀνήρ/Strong’s 435), over the more general anthrōpos 
(ἄνθρωπος/Strong’s 444). Also, choosing anār over anthrōpos refers to the physical size of a grown-
man’s body. The comparison to a full-grown body continues in the phrase to a measure of the stature of 
the fullness of Christ. Furthermore, complete man also refers to a man’s physical body size. A “complete 
man” is one who has a full-grown body. The metaphor is that, when our body is fully grown, we will 
have attained the same height and weight as Christ. The reference to children in v. 14 continues this 
stature-metaphor.
[G]to put on once and for all…There is a noteworthy change in verb tense between the verb to put aside 
in v. 23 (Gk. present tense) and the verb to put on in v. 24 (Gk. aorist tense); the words repeatedly and 
once and for all are insinuated by these tenses. Also, as these two verbs are imperatives, a present-tense 
imperative is softer than an aorist-imperative. So the command to put on is like an order that an army 
captain would give to one of his soldiers or that a lord would give to one of his slaves. So the command 
to put on the new-self is more urgent, abrupt, and forceful than the command to put off the old-self.

32|In the same situations, become kind to one another, tender-hearted and 
compassionate, and gracious, forgiving, and extending goodwill just as God in Christ 
was gracious, forgiving, and extended goodwill to you as well.


&EPH 5
1|Become imitators of God as children who are loved, 
2|and go about your 
day-to-day lives in love, just as Christ loved you and handed himself over to be crucified 
for your sakes as a sacrificial offering[a] with the goal of giving off an aromatic aroma 
when incinerated as a burnt offering. 
3|But fornication (i.e., sexual immorality) and 
uncleanness (i.e., any immoral practice which is filthy and disgusting) of any sort or 
greed—don’t even mention it[b] among yourselves, as not mentioning these things is 
what’s appropriate for the saints (i.e., those who believe in Christ). 
4|And things you 
ought to be ashamed of saying because they’re morally unacceptable or they’re obscene; 
and stupid, foolish babbling or sexual innuendos—that which ought not be spoken—don’t 
say these things, but rather speak words of gratitude all the more. 
5|In fact, wrap your 
head around this[c]: All fornicators, those who practice uncleanness, or those who are 
greedy (which is idolatry) don’t have an inheritance (i.e., don’t have a piece carved out 
for them) in the kingdom of Christ and God.
          
6|Let no one deceive you with empty words: the wrath of God comes upon the 
sons of disobedience (i.e., those who take it upon themselves to be disobedient) because 
of these things, 
7|so don’t partner up with them. 
8|You see, you were darkness back 
then, but now you are light in the Lord: go about your day-to-day lives as children of 
light 
9|(As a side-note, the fruit (i.e., the byproduct) of light can be found in any kind of 
and all sorts of[d] goodness, righteousness, and truth), 
10|giving your approval to 
what is pleasing to the Lord. 
11|And don’t take part in the fruitless (i.e., no long-
term benefit) works of darkness, but expose them instead; 
12|for the things which 
take place in secret which are done by them are embarrassing to even talk about. 

13|Now everything which is exposed by the light gets brought out in the open, 
plain for all to see. 
14|In fact, anything which itself brings things out in the open 
and makes them plain to see is light[A]. Therefore it says,

You there who’s sleeping: get up
And arise from the dead
And Christ will shine on you (i.e., he’ll appear to you)

          
15|So see to it that you go about your day-to-day lives monitoring whether 
your lives are up to standard in every aspect, not living as an unwise person but as a 
shrewd and wise one, 
16|making the most of the time and taking advantage of 
every opportunity, because it’s bad out there[e]. 
17|Because of this, don’t get to 
where you’re careless, reckless, thoughtless, or stupid, but rather constantly understand 
what the will of the Lord is. 
18|And don’t get drunk on wine—in which is a 
reckless disregard for your own self-preservation—but be continuously filled with the 
Spirit while in the Spirit[f] instead, 
19|speaking among yourselves or to yourselves in 
popular songs accompanied by instruments, songs of praise[B], and spiritual songs[C] 
(i.e., prophetic manifestations of the Holy Spirit put to song, including singing in 
tongues), singing in general and singing popular tunes—tunes which may be 
accompanied by musical instruments[g]—with the heart to the Lord, 
20|always 
offering thanksgiving for everything[h] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the 
Father[i], 
21|submitting to one another in a reverence of Christ bordering on fear.
          
22|Wives are to submit[D] to their husbands as though submitting to the Lord, 

23|since the husband is the head[j] of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, he 
personally being the savior of the body. 
24|Anyways, as the church submits to 
Christ, this is the same way that wives are to submit to their husbands in all aspects.
          
25|Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and 
surrendered himself and was taken into custody for her sake, 
26|so that he would 
set her apart and make her holy after cleaning her up in the bathtub with the word of 
God, 
27|so that he personally could present to himself the church imbued with 
glory, having no spot, wrinkle, or anything of that sort, but instead that she would be 
holy and blameless when presented. 
28|The way that husbands ought to love their 
wives is as if they were their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself; 

29|the fact of the matter is that no one ever hated his own flesh, rather cherishes 
and nourishes it[k], just as Christ cherishes and nourishes the church, 
30|because we 
are a part of his body. 


31|Because of this
A man shall leave his father and mother
And adhere to his wife,
And the two will be molded into a single flesh


32|This mystery—and I’m referring to Christ and to the church—is deep[l]. 

*[a]a sacrificial offering…Lit: an offering and a sacrifice. A figure of speech.
*[b]don’t even mention it…Lit: let it not even be named
*[c]wrap your head around this…Lit: know [for a fact] while knowing [understanding something abstract]. 
This appears to be an expression.
*[d]any kind of and all sorts of…Lit: all
*[e]it’s bad out there…Lit: the days are evil. The word days as used here is a personification.
*[f]filled with the Spirit while in the Spirit …Lit: filled in [the] Spirit. Note that this phrase in the GT for in 
Spirit is the same one found 1 Cor. 12:3; Rev. 1:10. It means the same thing. Ref. notes there.
*[g]singing in general and singing popular tunes—tunes which may be accompanied by musical 
instruments…Lit: singing and psalm-ing. Ref. note of previous verse.
*[h]everything…Or: everyone
*[i]God the Father…Lit: the God and Father
*[j]head…See 1 Cor. 11 for usage of the word head in this context
*[k]it…Also: her. This has a dual-meaning, since the Gk. word for flesh is feminine, it can—and does—refer 
to both “it” (the flesh) and “she” (the wife).
*[l]deep…Lit: great

*[A]anything which itself brings things out in the open and makes them plain to see is light…Or: all which is 
being manifested is light. Interpreting the Gk. verb tense of is being manifested as a middle voice instead 
of passive, in order to make sense of this and fit it into the context. Usage of the middle voice like this is 
extremely rare in the NT (this is skating on thin ice).
*[B]popular songs accompanied by instruments, songs of praise…Lit: psalms and hymns. The Gk. word for 
psalm means, “to vibrate by touching” (Thayer); “song of praise accompanied on the harp” (Max & 
Mary); the Gk. word for hymn means, “a song in praise of gods, heroes, and conquerors” (Thayer). 
Thayer goes on to say (with a quotation from Synesius? embedded), “[the Gk. word for] song is the 
generic term; [the Gk. words for] psalm and hymn are the specific, the former designating a song which 
took its general character from the OT Psalms (although not restricted to them, see 1 Cor. 14:15,26), the 
latter a song of praise. ‘While the leading idea of psalm is a musical accompaniment, and that of hymn 
praise to God, song is the general word for a song, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, whether of 
praise or on any other subject. Thus it was quite possible for the same song to be at once psalm, hymn, 
and song.’ The words occur together in Col. 3:16 and Eph. 5:19.” Also, ref. note of 1 Cor. 14:15.
*[C]spiritual songs…The word for spiritual here is the same word used in 1 Cor. 12:1 “concerning 
spirituals” (see note there) and is also found in 1 Cor. 14:15,37. In both v. 19 here and 1 Cor. 14:15:37, 
this phrase means a prophetic utterance or the equivalent of a prophetic utterance in the form of 
tongues and interpretation. A spiritual song is a prophetic utterance which is put to song.
[D]submit…Ref. note of 1 Pet. 2:18, which explains the Gk. words for submit and obey. A case in point is 
the usage of submit here, but the usage of obey in 6:1. Wives are told to submit, but children are told to 
obey.

Ephesians

1|Children, obey your parents as part of your walk with the Lord[a]; this is the 
right thing to do, you see. 
2|”Honor your father and mother,” which is the foremost[b] 
commandment found in the Law of Moses with a promise appended to it: 
3|”…So that it 
would go well with you and you would be blessed during your stay on the planet.” 

4|And, parents, don’t exasperate your children but raise them in the discipline, 
coaching, mentoring, and instruction of the Lord instead.
          
5|Slaves and menial servants, obey those who are your masters or bosses in the 
natural with the utmost reverence and respect[c] in the simplicity of your heart (i.e., 
without making something bigger out of it) as if being reverent to Christ, 
6|not just 
making the boss think you’re doing a good job when he’s looking and acting up when 
he’s not[d] but obeying as though you’re Christ’s slave instead, doing the will of God 
from the soul, 
7|serving with a good attitude[e] as if your service is to the Lord and not 
to humans, 
8|knowing for a fact that each person, if he were to do something in 
particular which is good, he’ll get this same thing back from the Lord, whether slave or 
free. 
9|And masters and bosses, treat them the same way[f], giving up the constant 
threat of punishment as your primary means of motivating your slaves, knowing for a fact 
that in the spiritual domain[g] the Lord is master and boss of both them and you, and 
there is no favoritism based on position in society or such with him.
          
10|In conclusion, be strong in the Lord and reach into the vastness of his 
power. 
11|Put on[h] all the components of God’s complete suit of armor[i] so you’ll 
have the ability to stand against the schemes of the devil, 
12|because the fight 
we’re in isn’t against flesh and blood, but against the rulers (i.e., the evil spirits who 
have dominion at the top of a hierarchy, presumably over other evil spirits), against the 
authorities (i.e., the evil spirits with power over a specific area), against the world-
dominators of this darkness (i.e., the evil spirits who dominate the ungodly human 
system and society that is the darkness we’re surrounded by), against the spirit-forces 
of wickedness in the spiritual domain[g].
          
13|On account of this, take up God’s complete suit of armor, so that you’ll 
be able to withstand the spiritual forces of the devil in the day of evil and—after you’ve 
accomplished everything on that day—to stand. 
14|So stand, after having fastened 
the belt of truth around your waist[j], and having put on the breastplate of 
righteousness, 
15|and having put on your feet the preparation of the good-news 
message of the Gospel of peace, 
16|in all situations[k] having taken up the shield of 
faith, by which you’ll be able to extinguish and knock out all the Evil One’s flaming 
projectiles, 
17|and having received the helmet of salvation and the sword of the 
Spirit (which is the word of God), 
18|with every sort of[l] prayer and supplication 
(i.e., an urgent request put into prayer) praying in every season of life in the Spirit, and 
while at it with maximum perseverance and prayer be on the lookout looking around to 
see how all the saints (i.e., believers) are doing, 
19|and for me, so that a message 
may be given to me when I open my mouth to boldly make known the mystery of the 
Gospel 
20|(for which I’m an ambassador kept on a short leash[m]) so that with the 
same I will speak out freely, boldly, and confidently as it is incumbent on me to speak.
          
21|Now, so that you too would know what’s going on with me and how I’m 
doing[n], Tychicus, a dear brother and a faithful assistant[o] in the Lord, will fill you in on 
everything, 
22|whom I sent to you with that very goal in mind, so you’d know 
what I’m up to and that he’d give your hearts encouragement and comfort.
          
23|Extend a greeting of peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the 
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ[p]. 
*[a]as part of your walk with the Lord…Lit: in the Lord
*[b]foremost…Also: first
*[c]the utmost reverence and respect…Lit: fear and trembling. An idiom; also found in 1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 
7:15; Phil 2:12.
*[d]not just making the boss think you’re doing a good job when he’s looking and acting up when he’s 
not…Lit: not according to eye-serving as man-pleasers
*[e]good attitude…Also: goodwill
*[f]treat them the same way…Lit: do the same things to them
*[g]spiritual domain…Lit: the heavens
*[h]put on…The Gk. verb tense used for this imperative is a strong command, like one an officer gives to a 
soldier, something he should snap to attention and get done immediately.
*[i]all the components of God’s complete suit of armor…Lit: the full armor of God. The Gk. word panoplia 
(πανοπλία/Strong’s 3833), where we get the English word panoply, is used here for full armor.
*[j]after having fastened the belt of truth around your waist…Lit: having your loins girded in truth. A 
reference to Is. 11:5; 59:17.
*[k]in all situations…Lit: in all. Older commentaries (and one would assume they’re based on Textus 
Receptus) read upon all (rendered above all) instead; Codex Vaticanus/UBS NT read in all.
*[l]every sort of…Lit: all
*[m]kept on a short leash…Lit: in a chain. Some liberties taken.
*[n]how I’m doing…Or: what I practice
*[o]assistant…Lit: deacon. Ref. note of Rom. 12:7.
[p]from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ…Lit: from God Father and Lord Jesus Christ. A good 
example of how the definite article is assumed in prepositional phrases and therefore omitted. In the 
GT, the word God is normally preceded by the definite article.


Philippians
       The church at Philippi is introduced in Acts 16, where Paul is diverted to Macedonia, where 
Philippi is, by an angel which told him, “Cut across the Aegean Sea to Macedonia and help us out.” 
Shortly after, he meets women in Philippi who gathered outside the city by the river, and these women 
were the basis for the church at Philippi. In fact, of the names mentioned in this letter to the Philippians, 
only women are found. Scholars speculate whether this church consisted entirely of women at the time 
Paul wrote this epistle.
       By the tone and content of the letter, the church in Philippi is one of the stronger, more spiritual 
churches that Paul founded. Because of this, it’s fitting that they be all women, since the low-profile 
dedication of women such as these has carried Christianity—even before that, going back to Jesus’s 
ministry—since the beginning, an oft overlooked and seldom noted cause for the strength, vigor, and 
propagation of Christianity through the millennia.
       The letter to this spiritual church contains few rebukes, few corrections concerning doctrine, 
and is salted with Paul’s tender affections. The lack of quotations from the OT indicates that those 
whom the letter was addressed to had no affiliation with Judaism, no knowledge of the OT. They were 
Gentiles through and through.
        The GT is smooth, easily converted into another language, but draws on a deep vocabulary.

1|From Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus,
      To all the saints (i.e., believers) in Christ Jesus who live in Philippi together with 
the bishops (i.e., head pastors; overseers) and deacons (i.e., assistant pastors; assistants 
entrusted with significant responsibilities; heads of ministry departments):
          
2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
3|I give thanks to my God every time I think about you while reminiscing, 

4|always making every one of my requests put into prayer for you all with joy, 

5|and I give thanks for your working closely with me in the spreading of the Gospel (i.e., 
the good-news message of Christ) from the first day until the present. 
6|I’ve reached 
the point where I’m convinced of this very thing, that He who began a good work in 
you will complete it, working towards that ends until the day of Christ Jesus, 
7|just as 
it’s right for me to be thinking about all of you this way, on account of me having you 
both in my heart and in my chains and in the verbal defense and confirmation of the 
certainty of the Gospel—you all being my fellow-workers of this grace.
          
8|In this regard, God is my witness to the fact that I long for all you with the 
deep, inner affections of Christ Jesus. 
9|And I pray this, that your love would 
proliferate even more and more in recognition, in more precise knowledge, and in every 
sort of insight gained from perception, 
10|resulting in your continual testing and 
approving of those things which excel, so that you would be sincere and won’t get 
tripped up and would maintain this to the day of Christ, 
11|having reached the point 
where you’ve been filled from the byproduct[a] of righteousness which is through Jesus 
Christ to the glory and praise of God.
          
12|I want you to know, comrades[b], that the situation I find myself in has 
further advanced the Gospel, 
13|in that an awareness and understanding of my 
bonds in Christ has been made known among the entire palace guard detachment and 
among everyone else, 
14|and many of the comrades in the Lord, urged on by my 
bonds, are much more daring about going around speaking the word of God without fear.
          
15|While it’s true that some preach Christ because they’re motivated by 
jealousy and strife, on the other hand some are motivated by good intentions. 

16|While they who spread the Gospel out of love know for a fact that I’ve been 
appointed to give a verbal defense of the Gospel, 
17|on the other hand they who 
proclaim Christ out of ambition and not with sincerity expect to stir up vexation for me 
while I’m in jail[c]. 
18|So what?—except for this: that Christ is proclaimed in all 
respects, whether with ulterior motives or with no hidden agenda[d], and in this I 
rejoice—and indeed I will rejoice, 
19|for I know for a fact that this will result in 
deliverance for me through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, 

20|in line with my eager expectation and hope that I won’t be embarrassed or 
humiliated in any way, but rather with every sort of frankness, forthrightness, and 
openness imaginable Christ will be magnified now—as always—in my body, whether 
through life or through death.
          
21|You see, the way I see it[e], to live is Christ and to die is gain (i.e., is 
advantageous; is a desirable option). 
22|If I live on in the flesh, this will yield 
tangible results from my work[f]. And what will I choose?—I can’t tell; 
23|I’m 
caught between the two, having the desire to be set free again and to be together with 
Christ, for this is much, much better[g]. 
24|But to remain in the flesh is more 
necessary for your sakes. 
25|And convinced of this I know that I will remain here on 
Earth and stay by your side—with all of you—for your progress and for the joy which 
comes from faith, 
26|so that your grounds for speaking proudly would proliferate 
in Christ Jesus by my doing, on account of me visiting you again.
          
27|Only let your life in society be worthy of the Gospel of Christ, so that, 
whether I come and see you or am away, I hear what you’re up to, that you stand 
together in one spirit[h], one soul, joined together by the Faith of the Gospel 
28|and 
are not frightened and intimidated by anything done by your adversaries, which in 
particular is indicative of their ruin, but of your salvation (i.e., your being kept from 
ruin); and this intimidation-ruin-salvation pattern is from God, 
29|since the thing 
given—undeservedly so[i]—to you on Christ’s behalf is to not only to believe in him but 
to suffer on his behalf, 
*[a]byproduct…Lit: fruit
*[b]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]stir up vexation for me while I’m in jail…Lit: raise distress in my bonds

clearly.

both.
[i]given—undeservedly so…The Gk. word used for given [charidzomai,(χαρίζομαι/Strong’s 5483)] here is 
not what one would expect. Charidzomai also means to give, but has emphasizes the magnanimousness 
of the person doing the giving, and/or insinuating that the person receiving the gift didn’t earn it.

1|SSo now, if there’s any comfort or exhortation in Christ, if any consolation 
offered by love, if any commonality and fellowship of spirit[a], if any deep, inner 
affection— 
2|you’ll make me overjoyed if you would adopt that way of thinking[b], 
having the same love, being harmonious and on the same page[c], 
3|with no one 
motivated by ambition or by conceit but by humility instead, considering each other to 
be better than yourselves, 
4|not paying careful attention to your own affairs 
exclusively but instead paying careful attention to each other’s affairs as well.
          
5|Maintain in you the way of thinking that was also in Christ Jesus, 
6|who, 
while existing in the form of God, didn’t think being equal to God was a thing that had to 
be to be held onto with everything you’ve got[d], 
7|but instead depleted himself and 
assumed the form of a slave, having turned into something similar to humans, and, 
unveiled to the public[e] having the appearance of that of a human being, 
8|he 
humbled himself and became obedient until it reached a point where the obedience required 
his death, not just any-old death but the death of crucifixion on a cross. 
9|And in light of 
this, God[A] exalted him (i.e., promoted him to a high position) and out of His generosity 
gave[B] him the name which is above all names (i.e., gave him the ultimate top rank, 
outranking every other rank), 
10|so that in the name of Jesus (i.e. when Jesus’s 
authority is invoked) every knee would bow of the things in the heavens (i.e., in heaven; 
in the spiritual domain) and of the things on the Earth and of the things under the earth 
(i.e., the world of the dead, including hell) 
11|and every tongue would confess out 
loud that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
          
12|So now, my dear comrades, just as you have always obeyed, not just when 
I was there in person but even more in my absence, work at the salvation where your 
own selves are concerned with the utmost reverence and respect[f]; 
13|you see, God 
is the One Who’s working in you both the wanting and the working-on of what pleases 
Him[g].
          
14|Do all things while distancing yourselves from grumbling and scheming 
or plotting, 
15|so that you would become blameless and innocent, children of God 
in the midst of a crooked and perverted Zeitgeist[h], in which you shine as lights in the 
world, 
16|holding fast to a message of life, resulting in me having proud words to 
tell others up to the day of Christ, since you haven’t run life’s race or toiled for nothing.
          
17|Anyways, if I’m being poured out like a libation upon the altar and during 
the liturgy of your faith, I will rejoice and will rejoice together[i] with you all— 

18|And the same for you: you will rejoice and will rejoice together with me.
          
19|Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you posthaste, so that 
once I know what you’re up to, it’ll put me at ease. 
20|I have no one, you see, who 
sees things the way I do, a certain someone who’ll truly care for you. 
21|In fact, 
everyone I’ve tried to find to work with me is pursuing their own self-interests, not the 
interests of Jesus Christ. 
22|But you’re familiar with how he qualified to receive my 
trust, that he served me in the Gospel like a son serves a father. 
23|So I certainly 
hope to send this fellow as I could immediately turn my attention to my affairs were he to 
be sent. 
24|I’m convinced in the Lord of the same, that I too will come posthaste.
          
25|I deemed it necessary that I send you Epaphroditus, my comrade[j], 
coworker, and fellow soldier-in-arms—your missionary[k] and my personal attendant— 

26|since he was longing to see all of you and was quite distressed because you 
heard that he was rundown with some sort of sickness[l]. 
27|You see, he was 
weakened by sickness to the point of death, but instead of him dying God had mercy on 
him, and not just on him but on me too so that I wouldn’t be wrenched with pain upon 
pain. 
28|So with even more urgency I sent him on his way so that after seeing him 
again you would rejoice and I would be relieved of my pain. 
29|So receive him in 
the Lord with all the joy you can muster, and honor[m] individuals like him, 
*[a]of spirit…Or: of [the] Holy Spirit. Ref. note of 1:27.
*[b]you’ll make me overjoyed if you would adopt that way of thinking…Lit: fulfill my joy so that you would 
think the same
*[c]on the same page…Lit: of one thinking
*[d]held onto with everything you’ve got…Lit: snatched by force and held onto. Here’s a mental picture: a 
football player (American football) who has a fumbled football and is holding onto it, with a pile of other 
players on top of him trying to pull it out of his hands, before the referee comes over.
*[e]unveiled to the public…Lit: found
*[f]utmost reverence and respect…Lit: fear and trembling. Ref. note of Eph. 6:5.
*[g]of what pleases Him…Lit: on behalf of the pleasing [of him]. The definite article before pleasing is put 
there as a short way to imply of him.
*[h]Zeitgeist…Lit: generation
*[i]will rejoice and will rejoice together…Or: rejoice and rejoice together. The GT is ambiguous, as the 
present and future forms in this case are identical. Since this is the apodosis of a conditional sentence, it 
doesn’t matter so much.
*[j]comrade…Lit: brother
*[k]missionary…Lit: apostle
*[l]rundown with some sort of sickness…Lit: weak
*[m]honor…Also insinuates that they should pay his room and board when he’s there

*[A]And in light of this, God…Lit: wherefore and God. The word and is associated to wherefore. In NT Gk., 
It’s common to have and come after a word such as wherefore. This means that and is not associated to 
God; some translations err in this manner and render these words “Wherefore God also” or “Therefore 
God, even God” (and appearing as even in this case).
[B]out of His generosity gave…Same word to give as is used in 1:29; see note there. It was generous for 
God to hand over the keys to His kingdom to Jesus, but on the other hand, Jesus earned this by his 
obedience. Though the word gave as used here points to God’s generosity, it does not negate the fact 
that Jesus earned a name above every name. God’s generosity was in the fact that He is willing to 
bestow an enormous amount of power on another person of the Trinity, not holding it for Himself. This 
is a reason why the three persons in the Trinity are one instead of three. Islam denies the Trinity 
because it says that the three persons in the Trinity would compete for power, but the insinuation in the 
word give here is that God the Father out of His generosity won’t vie for power but instead hands it over 
to the Son.

1|In conclusion, my dear comrades[a], rejoice in the Lord. It’s no problem at all 
for me to write this over and over, and it’ll keep you from careening into a ditch.
          
2|Look at the dogs (i.e., those who are worthless, contemptuous people who 
live like animals; those who are excluded from having a covenant with God) and don’t 
stop looking at them, look at those who do evil, look at the anti-circumcision (i.e., those 
who think they have a covenant with God but the opposite is true). 
3|The fact of the 
matter is that we are the circumcision[A] (i.e., you’re the ones who actually have a 
covenant with God), the ones who have a service of worship in the Spirit of God and 
make audacious remarks in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh (i.e., in your 
own selves; in your abilities apart from God to please God; in your ability to gain God’s 
favor by simply following a list of rules; in your human credentials), 
4|although I 
have confidence in the flesh. If some other person has confidence in the flesh, I have 
more. 
5|Circumcised on the eighth day; an Israeli by race, of the tribe of Benjamin, a 
Hebrew who stands out among the Hebrews; a Pharisee who was totally committed to doing 
everything according to the Law of Moses; 
6|as far as the intensity of his zeal[b], a person 
who was persecuting the church; as far as his pursuit of a righteousness (i.e., a means of 
standing before God and telling Him why He should approve of your life) which is 
generated by means of following the Law, faultless.
          
7|Never mind all that—whatever gain (i.e., advantages) I had, I consider it to 
be lost (i.e., to have been forfeited) on account of Christ. 
8|Oh, no, no—even I consider 
everything forfeited on account of the surpassing greatness and excellence of the 
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom everything has been forfeited, 
and I consider everything to be garbage and crap so that I may gain Christ 
9|and that I 
would be found in him not having my own righteousness, one which is derived from 
following the Law but instead one which is through the faith of Christ, which is a 
righteousness from God on the basis of the Faith— 
10|to come to know him and 
the power of his resurrection and the sharing of and participation in his sufferings, 
while being conformed to his death, 
11|if somehow I might attain the breaking free 
from and rising from the dead.
          
12|Not that I’ve already attained these things I’m writing about or have 
reached the point of perfection, but I’m chasing after these things in the hope that I just 
might put them under my thumb, on the basis of me having been put under the thumb 
by Christ Jesus. 
13|Comrades, I don’t figure that I’ve reached the point where I’ve 
put these things under my thumb, but I do this one thing: I forget about what’s behind 
me and press on to what lies ahead of me. 
14|I keep my eye on the ball[c] and chase 
after the prize of God’s high calling in Christ Jesus. 
15|So any person at all who’s 
mature[d], may we be of this opinion; and if you are of a different opinion, God will 
reveal this to you. 
16|In any event, let’s be diligent about maintaining what we’ve 
already attained.
          
17|Become people who imitate me, comrades, and pay careful attention to 
those who live their day to day lives using us as role-models. 
18|You see, many 
live their day to day lives in the opposite manner, people whom I was constantly writing 
to you about, but now—even while crying—I’m telling you are the enemies of the cross 
of Christ, 
19|people whose destination is destruction, whose god is their belly and 
who take delightful pride[e] in their shame, who are consumed with thinking about 
earthly things. 
20|As far as we’re concerned, though, the country that we’re 
citizens of exists in the heavens (i.e., in the spiritual domain and in heaven itself), from 
which we also eagerly await a savior, namely the Lord Jesus Christ, to come out of, 

*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers

v. 12; Meyers says it means morally mature. This is due to Paul including himself in saying may we be a 
couple words later, when he said he’s not perfect in v. 12.

[A]the circumcision…Many biblical scholars believe that the Philippian church consisted of all women. If 
this is the case, then Paul is calling women “the circumcision,” which, physically speaking, only applies to 
men. This supports the notion that there are words in the Bible which, on the surface only apply to men, 
but in fact apply to both men and women.

they who are the very ones who came and joined me in helping spread the Gospel (i.e., 
the message I’m spreading), which includes Clement and the rest of my other fellow 
workers whose names are in the Book of Life.

generous, mild, gentle, kind, tolerant demeanor be made known to all people: the Lord 
is nearby.
          
6|Don’t worry, be anxious, or have angst about anything, but instead in every 
situation and concerning everything you need make your requests known to God by 
means of prayer and supplication with thanksgiving[f], 
7|and the peace of God which 
transcends everything in your mind and transcends all mental activity[g] will guard your 
hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
          
8|In conclusion, comrades, whatsoever is true, whatsoever is honorable, 
whatsoever is right, whatsoever is pure, whatsoever is admirable, whatsoever is 
laudable—let these things turn over in your head—let your mind crunch these 
thoughts—figure these things out—meditate on them. 
9|And what you learned, 
embraced[h], heard, and saw in me, put these things into practice, and the God of peace 
will be with you.
          
10|I was just thrilled in the Lord that your consideration for how well-off I am 
has finally improved[i], in the respect that you considered my financial state of affairs over 
and over again but time and again lacked the opportunity to help me out financially. 

11|Not that I’m forced to speak this way out of lack, seeing that I’ve learned to be 
self-sufficient regardless of the situation I’m in. 
12|I know from firsthand 
experience both how it is to be humbled (i.e., live in a financially bankrupted or 
impoverished condition) and how it is to be prosperous: in each and every circumstance 
I’ve learned the secret of[j] every one of these: getting my belly filled, going hungry, 
prospering, and having a lack of provision: 
13|I can do anything by him who gives 
me the power. 
14|Nevertheless it was a good thing that you did in commiserating 
with, sharing in, and partaking of my difficulties.
          
15|Now also, you know for a fact, Philippians, that in the early days of the 
Gospel when I left Macedonia, no church participated in regard to this matter of giving 
and receiving except for you only, 
16|that once and again a second time while I was 
in Thessalonica you sent me a contribution to help with my needs. 
17|Not that I’m 
fishing for handouts[k]—no—I’m seeking the Fruit which is being multiplied and credited 
to your account[A]. 
18|But I have everything I need and then some, having been 
resupplied by Epaphroditus by those things sent from you, a pleasant odor, an 
acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God like the sacrifices offered to God in the Old Testament 
that He said pleased Him[B]. 
19|My God shall supply all your needs reflective of His 
riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 
20|But the glory be given to our God and Father 
forever and ever. Amen (i.e., let us pause a moment for that finishing remark to sink in).
          
21|Say hello to all the saints in Christ Jesus (i.e., those who believe in Christ) 
for me. The comrades with me extend their greetings to you as well. 
22|All the

generous in giving material things.

verses in the OT that use this language, and it’s used figuratively in the NT as well. Examples are Lev. 
1:4,13, 17; 2:2,9,12; 3:5; 4:20,26, 35; 26:31; Rom. 12:1,2; 2 Cor. 2:15.


Colossians
       As mature, committed, and faithful that the churches in Ephesus and Philippi were, judging by 
the introductory part of Paul’s letter, the church in Colossae was on par with them, and one might argue 
more so. The entire first chapter is a discourse on who Jesus is and what he received by means of his 
death and resurrection. This knowledge is not revealed in the Gospels but is reserved for the epistles 
and forms a bedrock on the question of who Jesus was and is.
       But by the second chapter, Paul is dropping hints that there are a few, persuasive people among 
them who are steering them in the wrong direction. We find out that this is in regard to practices of the 
Law, but the warnings Paul gives are not as severe as what he told the Galatians.
       And Paul repeats the admonishments he gave to wives, husbands, children, and slaves same as 
what he gave the Ephesian church. He probably told all of his churches this.
       There’s nothing out of the ordinary to be found in the Greek text. A good depth of vocabulary, 
but Paul doesn’t get into heady points of philosophy one finds in some of his other epistles, which 
removes that difficulty from the translator’s plate.

1|From Paul the apostle of Christ Jesus through the agency of the will of God and 
from Comrade[a] Timothy,
          
2|To the saints (i.e., the believers in Christ)—what faithful comrades![b]—in 
Colossae,
      Grace and peace to you from our Father-God:
          
3|While praying, we’re constantly thanking the Father-God of our Lord Jesus 
Christ for you, 
4|having heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and about the love you 
have for all the saints 
5|on account of the hope which is stashed away[c] for you in the 
heavens (i.e., in the spiritual domain or in heaven itself), which you previously heard 
about in the Message of Truth which is from the Gospel (i.e., the glad-tidings message of 
Christ), 
6|which is close by at our disposal, just as it is producing positive results and 
spreading[d] in every place of the world just as it is also doing the same in us as well from 
the days you heard about it and came to recognize the grace of God contained in the 
truth, 
7|which is consistent with the way you were taught it by our dear servant 
Epaphras, who is a faithful deacon (i.e., servant entrusted with significant 
responsibilities) of Christ for matters pertaining to you, 
8|who also told us about your 
love in the Spirit.
          
9|On account of this, since the days when you first heard the Gospel, we haven’t 
quit asking in prayer[e] that you would be filled with a recognition and an arrived-at 
knowledge and understanding of His will in every sort of spiritual or Holy Spirit-
related wisdom and understanding, 
10|equipped to go about your lives in a totally 
pleasing manner worthy of the Lord, being productive in every good work and growing 
in a recognition and a more-precise knowledge and understanding of God, 

11|being powered with every kind of power imaginable[f] reflective of the strength 
of His glory which He can bring to bear[g] towards the goal of attaining every degree of 
steadfastness, perseverance, and patience imaginable, with joy 
12|thanking the 
Father over and over again who caused us to be fit for and adequate to receive the portion 
of the inheritance of the saints in the light (i.e., the things which God has planned and 
intended specifically for His people who exist in the light)— 
13|He Who rescued 
us out of the authority of the darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His 
beloved son, 
14|in whom we have the Redemption (i.e., God’s plan of restoring out 
lives), which is the forgiveness of sins— 
15|He who is a reflection[h] of the Unseen 
God, the first-born who has the right of primogeniture over all creation, 
16|since in 
him all things were created in the heavens (i.e., the astronomical objects; things in the 
spiritual world; things in heaven itself) and upon the earth, the seen and the unseen, 
whether they be thrones, lordships, rulers, or authorities[A]—all things have been created 
through him, because of him, for him, and to him, 
17|and he’s before all things 
(i.e., takes the lead over, has priority over all things) and everything is banded together 
in him.
          
18|And he’s the head of the body, made up of the church, a person who is a 
ruler, a firstborn who came up out of the dead so that he himself would become a first 
born-primogeniture for everything, 
19|since it pleased God to have all fullness (i.e., 
the totality of power, of control, of judgment) take up residence and dwell in him, 

20|and through him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through 
the blood of his cross, whether those things are on the Earth or those things are in the 
heavens.
          
21|You, back then, were alienated and hostile in your thoughts and 
opinions[i] when you lived in the Evil Deeds, 
22|but now he has reconciled you in his 
body of plain, ordinary flesh[j] through the death he underwent to present us holy, 
blameless, and irreproachable before Him (i.e., when scrutinized by Him), 
23|if 
you truly remain in the Faith grounded, stable, and unperturbed from the hope of the 
good message (the Gospel) you heard, which was preached to any warm body to be 
found anywhere[B], a message for which I Paul became a minister.
          
24|At the present time I rejoice in the sufferings I must endure for your sakes, 
and contribute my fair share[k] of Christ’s ordeal of hardship[l] in my flesh for the sake of 
his body, which is the Church, 
25|which I became a servant[m] of, entrusted with 
responsibilities reflective of the stewardship of God that was given to me, a stewardship 
given with the goal of you becoming fully developed[n] in the word of God, 
26|the 
word of God being the mystery which has been hidden from the ages (i.e., the different 
eras of history) and from the generations (i.e., the coming and going of a multitude of 
prevailing Zeitgeists), but now has been made manifest to His saints (i.e., His people), 

27|the people to whom God desired to make known and understood what the 
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is—which is Christ in you, the 
hope of glory— 
28|a mystery which[o] we proclaim, warning, admonishing, and 
advising everyone to take heed and instructing everyone with every sort of wisdom 
(and a bit of craftiness) imaginable, so that we could make everyone into a final product 
of a person who’s[p] fully developed in Christ.

beings.

creation under the sky” is an idiom. “Under the sky” and smacks of “under the sun” as used in Eccl. 1:9. 
The entire idiom means that the Gospel was preached to every sort of person there is and every in every

29|I’m also doing hard work 
towards that end, striving according to His working, a working which works in me in a 
powerful way.


&COL 2
1|The fact of the matter is that I want you to know how great a conflict I have 
on your behalf and on the behalf of those in Laodicea and whoever hasn’t met me face-
to-face, 
2|so that their hearts would be encouraged and comforted, having been 
united by love and with the goal of acquiring all the riches that come from a maturity[a] of 
understanding, with the goal of having a recognition and a more precise understanding 
of God’s mystery Christ, 
3|in whom all the repositories and treasures of wisdom and 
understanding are hidden away. 
4|This I say so that no one would reason otherwise 
and beguile you using clever arguments. 
5|Though I’m physically absent, I’m with 
you by means of the Spirit, rejoicing and seeing the discipline and steadfastness[b] of 
your faith in Christ.
          
6|So as you received (i.e., whole-heartedly embraced and drawn into your 
heart) Christ Jesus the Lord, go about your daily lives in him (i.e., melded with him), 

7|rooted and built up in him and established in the Faith consistent with the way you 
were taught, all the while brimming with thankfulness. 
8|See to it that not a one of 
you gets captivated through the use of the philosophy and worthlessness of cunning 
deception, delusion, and deceit in line with human tradition, in line with elementary 
principles of the world (i.e., the prevalent idea of God accepting you based on how well 
you follow the list of do’s and don’ts) and not in line with Christ
9|—Because in him 
dwells all the fullness of the Being Who is God in a bodily form, 
10|and you’ve 
been brought to your fullness in him, the one who is the head of every person or being 
who is a ruler or who has a position of delegated power[c], 
11|the one in whom you 
have been circumcised (i.e., inaugurated into a covenant) into a circumcision (i.e., a 
covenant) that wasn’t performed by a human hand (i.e., in a ritual that wasn’t 
performed by a human being like actual circumcision is) by the removal of that flesh-
infested body[d] (i.e., the removal of that carnal, I-can-do-it-myself-without-God human 
nature locked up in the body) by the circumcision of Christ (i.e., by analogy removing 
the carnality and do-it-yourself nature like removing the foreskin in circumcision), 

12|having been buried with him in the Christian baptism, a baptism in which you 
were also co-resurrected through the Belief which believes in the work that God does, 
Who raised him from the dead. 
          
13|And while you were in a state of being dead in the trespasses and the 
uncircumcision (i.e., the absence of a covenant with God) of your flesh, He made you 
alive together with him, forgiving you all the trespasses you were dead in, 
14|after 
he completely erased the promissory note which had written on it the decrees which were 
against us, he personally took it out of the picture and nailed it to the cross. 

15|Having publicly stripped rulers and authorities clean of any weapons or 
clothing—especially clothing indicating status, he made an example out of them and made 
them a public spectacle.
          
16|So let no one decide for you what you should or shouldn’t eat or drink, or 
decide what’s right or wrong on the topic of religious festivals, start of a new month 
celebrations, or holidays[A], 
17|that which is a shadow of what’s to come but the 
body which casts that shadow is Christ’s[B]. 
18|Let no one rob you of what’s rightfully 
yours by pushing an unassuming, self-abasing demeanor and a cult-like worship of the 
angelic beings[e], getting off into tangents about what he’s seen with his own eyes, 
exaggerated for no reason by his carnality-riddled mind[f], 
19|and not staying 
attached to[g] the head, from which every part of the body, replenished and joined 
together by means of the joints and ligaments, grows in a way that’s God’s kind of 
growth[h].
          
20|If you died with Christ to[i] the elementary principles of the world, why is 
it—as though you’re still living in the world and abiding by its elementary principles—that 
you subject yourselves to codified rules… 
21|”Don’t touch with intent of use, don’t 
eat, don’t have any physical contact with whatsoever[j] 
22|(regarding everything 
that wears out with use, that is)”…reflective of human commandments and teachings? 

*[a]from a maturity…Lit: of the fullness
*[b]disciple and steadfastness…Lit: formation and solid front. These are military terms which describe the 
formation of soldiers in a phalanx, for example.
*[c]every person or being who is a ruler or who has a position of delegated power…Lit: all rule and 
authority. Ref. note of 1 Cor. 15:24.
*[d]that flesh-infested body…Lit: the body of the flesh. A figure of speech (an antimereia). Ref. Col. 1:22.
*[e]the angelic beings…What we know as “angels” are often called “angels of God” in the NT to distinguish 
them from other angelic beings. This has no such a qualifier.
*[f]carnality-riddled mind…Lit: the mind of his flesh. A figure of speech.

*[j]Don’t touch with intent of use, don’t eat, don’t have any physical contact with whatsoever…Ref. note of 
1 Cor. 7:1

*[A]religious festivals, start of a new month celebrations, or holidays…Lit: festivals or new moons or 
Sabbaths. These are festivities prescribed by the Law of Moses and are mentioned several times in the 
OT. An example is the prophet Hosea in Hos. 2:11, “I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, 
her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts” (KJV). Just as Hosea described these with 
the word “mirth,” these are all holidays and celebrations, but celebrations and holidays which are 
commanded by the Law.
[B]that which is a shadow of what’s to come but the body which casts that shadow is Christ’s…Much of 
the Law of Moses was arcane rules that only makes sense in light of this clarification, that they were 
hints, symbols, and foreshadowings of what was to come, but the essence is in Christ. This reinforces 
what Paul said in Gal. 3:24.

23|These things are in a category of things which—yes—contain wisdom in regard 
to do-it-yourself cult-worship and in maintaining an unassuming, self-abasing 
demeanor and in treating the body harshly, but are of no value in the effort to conciliate 
the flesh. 


&COL 3
1|So if you were raised together with Christ, continually seek the things above 
where Christ is seated (i.e., occupying a position of authority), being at the right hand of 
God (i.e., God’s chief executive). 
2|Think on the things above, not on the things on 
Earth (i.e., think about things which have spiritual virtue and not things which are 
carnal). 
3|The fact of the matter is that you died and your life has been hidden 
together with Christ in God. 
4|When Christ—our life—is manifested, at that time we 
too will be manifested together with him in glory.
          
5|So put to death the on-Earth members (i.e., the parts of you which are prone 
to carnality)…fornication (i.e., sexual immorality of any sort); uncleanness (i.e., filthy, 
nasty, disgusting behavior of any sort; lewd, crude, crass, foul-mouthed, disgusting 
untidiness, abject neglect of personal hygiene; disgusting references to or treatment of 
bodily functions); passion (i.e., strong, out-of-control emotion or passionate desire 
which takes ascendency over logical thinking); bad, wrong, or evil desire; and greed, 
which is a thing in particular which amounts to[a] idolatry. 
6|Because of these things 
the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience[b] (i.e., those who make it their 
job to be disobedient). 
7|Back then you too went about your daily lives engaging in 
these things when you were continually seeking after life in the midst of these things. 

8|But lay aside every one of these things right now…vindictiveness (i.e., heightened 
anger in regard to punishment; a focus on retribution; a strong desire to make someone 
pay for what they did or to get even); wrath (i.e., a hot, out-of-control temper; 
unwarranted outburst of anger); malice (ill-will; desire to injure; being just plain bad); 
blasphemy (i.e., swearing at someone, trash-talking someone, smearing or slandering 
the reputation of someone); potty-mouth (i.e., speaking obscenities; cursing; swearing);
       
9|Don’t lie to each other, now that you’ve renounced the old-self[c] along with 
its practices 
10|and have put on the new-self, which is constantly being renewed to 
a recognition and a more precise knowledge and understanding reflective of the image 
of the One who created this new-self, 
11|where there’s not Greek (i.e., one who’s 
view of life was shaped by the philosophies and lifestyles of the ancient western 
civilizations) and Jew, circumcised (i.e., those who follow the Law of Moses and expect 
to have a relationship with God because of this) and uncircumcised (i.e., those who 
have no relationship with God), barbarian (i.e., the foreign, uncivilized, uneducated, 
uncultured), Scythian (i.e., the wild, savage, ferocious), slave (i.e., who are also the 
menial servants, the lowest of the low, the bottommost caste), freeman (i.e., working or 
middle-class)—uh-uh, every little bit of everything[d] is Christ.
          
12|So as the chosen of God, saints and beloved, put on (and get a move on with 
it![e]) deep-down pity, kindness, humility, a gentleness which comes from restraint, 
patience, 
13|putting up with one another and forgiving each other if anyone 
happens to have an issue with somebody. 
14|But on top of all these things, walk in 
the love of God, which ties everything up into a tidy package[f].
          
15|Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, peace for the purpose of you 
having been called to be in one body—and get to where you’re thankful also. 
16|Let 
Christ’s message[g] dwell on the inside of you richly, with all the wisdom you can muster 
instructing and admonishing yourselves in the use of psalms, hymns, and spiritual 
songs[h] (i.e., popular songs accompanied by instruments, songs of praise, and songs 
which consist of prophetic manifestations of the Holy Spirit, including singing in 
tongues), singing to God with joy in your hearts. 
17|And every one of the things 
you so happen to do, whether it’s a thing you do in speech or in action, do everything in 
the name of the Lord Jesus (i.e., do it as though Jesus told you to do it; do it as though 
it’s part of your Christian duty; do it knowing you have blessing of Jesus to do it), 
giving thanks to the Father-God through him.
          
18|Wives, submit[i] to your husbands as is proper in the Lord.
          
19|Husbands, love your wives and don’t be cruel, harsh, hateful, or severe 
with them.
          
20|Children, obey your parents in all respects; this is pleasing to the Lord, 
you see.
          
21|Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they not grow 
despondent.
          
22|Slaves, obey those who are your bosses, physically-speaking, in all 
respects, not just making the boss think you’re doing a good job when he’s looking and 
acting up when he’s not[j], but rather in a simplicity of heart (i.e., a heart which doesn’t 
rely on convoluted justifications; has no ulterior motives; attaches no strings; isn’t 
driven by fear, guilt, remorse, etc.), having a deep reverence[k] of the Lord. 
23|That 
which you happen to be doing, work it from the soul as to the Lord and not to humans, 

24|knowing for a fact that you will receive from the Lord the reward of the 
inheritance (i.e., of what God has intended specifically for you)—You serve by means of 
the Lord Christ.

1 Thessalonians
       Scholars believe that this epistle here is the first of Paul’s. There are both praises and 
admonishments, but not as severe as what the Corinthians received.
       The longing Paul has to see those “dear to us” (2:8), his “pride and joy” (2:20), the steps he took 
so that he “wouldn’t a burden on any of you” (2:9) permeate this letter. The longing is reiterated this 
way: “How can we possibly thank God enough for you for all the joy we’ve been elated with in the 
presence of God because of you” (3:9).
       This longing of one Christian to see another Christian has withered and died in the church in 
America, another indication of her decline.
       But towards the end of the book, a couple of things which seem out of place leap out at the 
reader. The first is Paul having to address a problem of sexual immorality—and it appears to have been 
adultery—in the church. Though a spiritual church, it was not without its glaring, peculiar faults. Second 
is an answer to one of their questions, namely how will they known when the end will come. Perhaps 
the mystery is not why this church asked this question but why few if any of Paul’s other churches 
didn’t. 
       The underlying text is consistent with what he sent to the Colossians, as the two churches are 
similar, and Paul’s writing style is likewise similar.

1|From Paul, Silas, and Timothy:
      To the church of Thessalonica in the Father-God and the Lord Jesus Christ:
      Grace to you and peace.
          
2|We’re always thanking God for all of you, bringing you up in prayer[a], 
continuously 
3|remembering your work of the Faith, your toil of the Love of God, and 
your steadfastness of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of[b] our God and 
Father, 
4|knowing full-well, comrades loved by God, your selection (i.e., God’s 
selection of you to be His), 
5|that our Gospel, the glad-tidings message which drew us 
together, did not present itself to us in word only but also in supernatural power and in 
the Holy Spirit and with much conviction, just as you know full-well what sort of men 
we turned out to be while among you throughout our stay with you.
          
6|And you became people who imitate us and the Lord, having received (i.e., 
having fully embraced) the word in the midst of a good deal of tribulation but with the 
joy of the Holy Spirit, 
7|so much so that you turned out to be a role-model for all the 
believers in Macedonia and in the Roman province of Asia.
          
8|In fact the word of the Lord sounded forth from you (i.e., you loudly and 
thoroughly announced, advertised, and disseminated the word of the Lord) not just in 
Macedonia and in Asia but in every place your faith in[c] God went out, so much so that 
there’s no need for us to be doing any more talking. 
9|Furthermore, the Macedonians 
and Asians personally are letting everyone know what an impact we’ve had on you[d],

&THESS1 2
1|In fact you yourselves know full-well, comrades[a], that the impact we had on 
you wasn’t a waste of time, 
2|rather, having suffered before and having been treated 
with insolence (as you’re well aware), in Philippi we were emboldened in our God to 
tell you God’s good-news message, the Gospel, while in the face of a lot of opposition. 

3|In fact, our encouragement was not from us being in error or from an uncleanness 
(i.e., something dirty, impure, or something one should stay away from), nor did it exist 
in deceit or guile, 
4|but instead it’s in line with the way we’ve been granted by God to 
be entrusted with the Gospel—that’s the way we speak, not like we’re speaking to 
people in a way where we’re trying to make them happy but like we’re speaking to God 
in a way to make Him happy instead, Who approves or disapproves of what’s in our hearts. 

5|For there was never a time when we showed up with a flattering message (as you’re 
well aware), nor did we show up having a pretext for covetousness—so help me God[b]— 

6|nor did we show up seeking prestige or fame[c], not from you or from anyone else, 

7|though, as Christ’s apostles, we’re capable of throwing our weight around[d]. Instead, 
we became infants while in your midst. The way a nursing mother cherishes her own 
children 
8|is the same way that we, having a strong yearning for you, thought it well 
to share not only the Gospel of God but also the things that make us live and breathe[A] 
themselves. Therefore, you became dear to us.
          
9|Furthermore, recollect, comrades, our back-breaking labor and toil: we 
worked day and night[e] so that we wouldn’t be a burden on any of you. Under these 
circumstances we preached the Gospel of God to you. 
10|You—and God—can attest 
to just how pious, correct, and faultless the demeanor was that we presented to you 
who are believers. 
11|Just as you know from experience that we treated each one of 
you like a father treats his own children, 
12|we were comforting, exhorting, 
advising, consoling, cheering, and issuing statements[f] for you to conduct your day to 
day lives in a manner worthy of God, Who calls us to His Own kingdom and glory.
          
13|And we thank God continuously because of this as well, since, having 
received (i.e., wholeheartedly embraced) God’s message (His systematic reasoning; His 
word) verbally communicated[g] from us to you, you didn’t receive a man-made message 
but instead you received it just as it actually is: God’s true message, a message which is[h] 
also at work in you who believe.
          
14|You see comrades, you followed the pattern set by the churches of God 
in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, in that you too suffered the same things done to you 
by your own countrymen like what was done to them by their fellow Judeans, 
15|who 
also killed the Lord Jesus and the Old Testament prophets and persecuted us. These 
countrymen live lives which are not pleasing to God; they are against all of humanity[i], 

16|hindering us from getting to speak to the Gentiles so that they could be saved 
(i.e., receive Christ as savior), the end-result being that every time they commit sin, they 
do it to the maximum extent[j]; the wrath of God came upon them to the utmost.
          
17|But we, comrades, bereft of you for a short while[k]—bereft from being 
there in person with you and not bereft of heart—with tremendous desire we all the 
more hastened to see your faces. 
18|Therefore we wanted to visit you—certainly I 
did, Paul—I started making arrangements once or twice but Satan thwarted us.
          
19|The fact of the matter is this: Who is our hope, our joy, or trophy[l] which 
we beam with pride over—if not you—yes you—joy of you being in the presence of[m] our 
Lord with his coming? 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers

is surrogate used to refer to a person. This carries over into English if, for example, a ship sank, we might 
say, “there were 25 souls that perished.” Using soul instead of person emphasizes the fact that the 
people mentioned had a life-essence to them. They had families, friends; they had interesting aspects to 
their personality; they had a will; they had a thirst for life which manifested itself in various way; they 
were real people. Also, ref. not of 1 Cor. 2:14.

1|In light of this, as we could no longer stand it, we thought it best to stay 
behind in Athens by ourselves, 
2|and so we sent Timothy, our comrade[a] and fellow-
worker of God in the Gospel (i.e. the good-news message) of Christ, for the purpose of 
getting you to stand on your own two feet and encouraging, advising, and comforting 
you in regard to your faith 
3|so as to not be agitated or emotionally upset in these 
times of distress; in fact, you yourselves know full-well that this is our fate in life. 

4|Furthermore, when we were with you, we kept telling you ahead of the fact that 
hard times are coming, just as it both happened and you know for a fact that it did. 

5|Because of this and because I couldn’t stand it any longer, I made inquiries to 
ascertain[b] your faith, lest somehow the Temptor tempted you and our labor turned out 
to be for nothing.
          
6|Just now Timothy arrived here at our place coming from your place and gave 
us good news in regard to your faith and your love and gave us the good news that you 
always remember us in a good way, longing to see us just we long to see you. 

7|Because of this we were encouraged and comforted, comrades, in what we hear about 
you on account of your faith while staring point-blank at[c] all our needs and afflictions, 

8|because we’re infused with life and vitality now[d] if it is the case that you stand in 
the Lord. 
9|In fact, how can we possibly thank God enough[e] for you for all the joy 
we’ve been elated with in the presence of[f] God because of you, 
10|day and night 
begging in prayer over and beyond the point of excess to see your face and repair the 
deficiencies of your faith?
          
11|May our God and our Father and our Lord Jesus set us on a straight 
course to see you.

13|with the end-goal 
of establishing your hearts blameless in holiness under the scrutiny of[f] our God and 
Father in the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints (i.e., his followers).


&THESS1 4
1|In conclusion, comrades[a], we ask you in the Lord—plead with you—that 
you go to higher and higher levels[b] in your being pleasing to God in your day to day 
lives in a way which is consistent with the instructions you received from us (which is 
consistent with the way you are currently living your lives). 
2|The fact of the matter is 
that you know some of the instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
3|In fact, 
this is the will of God (your holiness is the will of God!): it is for you to abstain from the 
fornication you’re surrounded by (i.e., by the loose sexual morals we all know about); 

4|for each of you to know how to gain possession and keep possession of his own 
personal container[c] (i.e., his body, the container for his soul and spirit) in holiness and 
dignity[d], 
5|not in an intense, all-consuming feeling of lust[A] (just like the Gentiles 
who don’t know God) 
6|but in not stepping out of line[e] and taking advantage of or 
defrauding his fellow-comrade in the matter[B] of sexual morality. Because of this the Lord 
takes vengeance in issues pertaining to these transgressions, consistent with the way we 
told you previously, telling it in a dead-serious manner. 
7|The fact of the matter is 
that God has not called you to uncleanness (i.e., God’s intention for your life in His 
kingdom was not to commit filthy, disgusting deeds) but rather to live in holiness. 

8|Consequently, he who disregards this command isn’t disregarding a human being 
but is disregarding God instead, Who gives His Holy Spirit to you.
          
9|Now about brotherly-love (i.e., having strong likings for other comrades[C]): 
you don’t need to have any instruction or advice written to you on this subject, seeing that 
you yourselves are God-instructed in the love one should have for another. 
10|In 
fact, you also extend the same practices to all the comrades all over Macedonia. We beg 
you, comrades, to do even more 
11|and make it a goal to be still (i.e., not be stirred 
by loud, negative emotions), to do your own things (i.e., concentrate on your own lives), 
and to work with your own hands (i.e., don’t rely on others to do your work), and do 
these things in line with the way we recommended, 
12|so that the way you conduct 
your lives would leave a good impression on those on the outside and so that you won’t 
need anything.
          
13|We don’t want you to be kept in the dark, comrades, about those who 
sleep (i.e., the believers who are already dead), so that you won’t grieve like the others, 
the ones who have no hope. 
14|To this point, if we believe that Jesus died and rose 
from the dead, then we are also entitled to believe that God will take those who sleep 
through Jesus (i.e., those who died trusting in Jesus) along together with him the same 
way. 
15|In fact, we’re telling you this in a word of the Lord (i.e., in a prophetic 
message from the Lord): you the living who remain on the Earth until[f] the coming of the 
Lord will absolutely not arrive at the destination before those who sleep, 
16|because 
the Lord himself—with the shout of a command[g] by the voice of an archangel and by 
God’s bugle call—will come down from heaven, and first the dead in Christ will be 
resurrected (i.e., brought back to life), 
17|then you who are alive who remain on the 
Earth will be taken together with them as a single unit into the clouds to a meeting with 
the Lord in the air—And that’s the way we’ll always be with the Lord.
          
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]go to higher and higher levels…Lit: abound more
*[c]container…Also: vessel. Like the way it’s used in 2 Cor. 4:7, this refers to our body.
*[d]dignity…Also: honor
*[e]stepping out of line…Lit: throwing beyond
*[f]until…Lit: to. As though heading towards a destination.
*[g]shout of a command…Lit: a call

*[A]intense, all-consuming feeling of lust…Lit: passion of desire [lust]. It’s normal for a person to have 
sexual desire, even a strong desire, but Paul’s talking about a desire that’s been amplified beyond 
normal amounts of sexual desire (strong as that may be). The Gk. word passion is also used to describe 
the passion of the pain and suffering of death, like the passion of Christ when he was crucified—this is 
how strong of a word it is. Sexual predators and sex offenders reach this point, the point where their 
passion of desire takes control of them and they commit criminal acts. A couple notches down, it will 
also cause the ordinary person to conduct immoral acts.
*[B]not stepping out of line and taking advantage of or defrauding his fellow-comrade in the 
matter…Applying logic to this statement here from v. 6 in relationship to the passage as a whole, Paul is 
telling those in the church not to “defraud” their fellow brother in Christ, and this in relationship to 
sexual morals. There are two possibilities: first, Paul could be talking about a man having an affair with 
another man’s wife. Second, Paul could be talking about a man sleeping with the young, unmarried 
daughter of another man. I believe it’s more likely that Paul is talking about the former than the latter. 
Therefore, the definition of the fornication (v. 3) is adulterous liaisons. This added with the additional 
evidence from 1 Cor. 5:1 suggest that the word fornication as used in the NT is talking about grossly 
immoral sexual acts. Or, put another way, when Paul addresses the issue here and in 1 Cor. 5:1, he’s 
talking about something which is grossly immoral. The church, however, makes no distinction between 
sexual acts which are grossly immoral and those which are mildly immoral when applying the word 
fornication. They should.
[C]having strong likings for other comrades…Lit: brotherly-love. This Gk. word is a compound where the 
second word love is the Gk. word philos (φίλος /Strong’s 5384) and not agapā (ἀγάπη/Strong’s 26). 
Philos differs from agapā in that philos is a love for a person because of how likeable they are, whereas 
agapā sees value in a person sometimes in spite of how unlikeable they are. Note that the word for love 
at the end of v. 10 is agapā, not philos.

1|Concerning the times (i.e., the year, day, or month significant events will 
occur) and the seasons (i.e., the atmosphere that defines the era events occur in; the 
climate the events occur in), comrades[a], you don’t need for me to write to you anything; 

2|the fact is that you know full well in yourselves and to a tee that the nature of the day 
of the Lord is that it comes in the same way as a thief in the night hits and runs. 

3|When they (i.e., everybody out there) are saying, “Peace and security,” then 
suddenly and unexpectedly destruction and ruin are perched on top of them staring 
down on them just like labor pains suddenly come upon a pregnant woman and there’s no 
way she can run away at that point and escape them. 
4|But you, comrades, aren’t in 
darkness (i.e., you aren’t being kept in the dark about this) so that that day would 
overwhelm you[b] like a thief would; 
5|for you all are sons of (i.e., you adopt the 
characteristics of) light and sons of day—We aren’t sons of night or sons of darkness.
          
6|So then don’t sleep (i.e., becoming spiritually dormant) like everyone else, 
but be watchful (i.e., stay focused) and sober (i.e., don’t let anything degrade your 
heightened state of alertness) instead. 
7|You see, those who sleep do their sleeping at 
night, and those who are drunkards do their drinking at night. 
8|But you’re in a state 
where you’re sober during the day, now that you’ve put on a breast-plate of faith and 
love and a helmet that is the hope of salvation (i.e., of escaping destruction, in this 
context the wrath of God), 
9|because God didn’t put us in a position that’s towards 
wrath[c] but He put us in a position that’s headed towards acquiring salvation (i.e., acquiring 
a means of escape, in this context from the wrath of God) through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

10|who died for us so that whether we happen to watch (i.e., remain alive and stay 
focused) or whether we happen to sleep (i.e., die) we would live together in the same 
time and place with him. 
11|In light of this, comfort one another and edify each 
other one-on-one just like you’re already doing.
          
12|We ask you, comrades, to know from first-hand observation those among 
you who do hard work and who have stepped forward to stand in leadership 
positions[d] in the Lord and who advise, warn, admonish, and instruct you, 
13|and 
to have a superabundant[e] high regard for them in love on account of their work.
      Keep the peace among yourselves.
          
14|We plead with you, comrades, that you advice, warn, admonish, and 
instruct the disorderly and insubordinate.
      Cheer up those who are discouraged.
      Take a strong interest in and help those who are weak (i.e., those who are unwell; 
worn out with a sickness; too physically weak to take care of themselves; powerless to 
do anything about their circumstances).
      Exercise patience with everyone.
          
15|See that no one, when somebody does something bad to them, retaliates 
by doing something bad back to them[f], but instead pursues the common good and the 
general good[g] at all times.
          
16|Rejoice all the time.
          
17|Pray incessantly.
          
18|Give thanks in the midst of all circumstances[h]; you see, this is the will of 
God for you in Christ Jesus.
          
19|Do not extinguish or put out the Holy Spirit when he’s burning. Do not 
quench, stifle, or suppress the Holy Spirit.
          
20|Do not despise, treat with contempt, or have utter disdain for prophesy, 

21|but examine all things including prophesies instead and accept the good and reject 
the bad and hold onto the good.
          
22|Stay away from any appearance of evil or wrong-doing.
          
23|Now may the God of peace Himself set you apart so that you’re complete 
in all respects and so that you meet all expectations; may your spirit, soul, and body[A] be 
blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
          
24|Faithful is He Who calls us; He will do it.
          
25|Comrades, pray for us too.
          
26|Greet all the comrades with a holy hug[i].
          
27|Make a promise to the Lord to have this letter read aloud to all the 
comrades, so everyone gets the chance to hear it.

Spirit—man is a spiritual being, and as such has commonality with all spiritual beings: God, angels, and 
demons. Sin causes the spirit to die; receiving Christ causes the spirit to be born again. The Holy Spirit 
dwells in a believer’s human spirit. Man’s spirit guides him through the course of life.
Soul—the soul is the mind, will, emotions. It’s the peculiar things that give a person personality and 
vitality.
Body—the obvious of course, but it also has man’s carnal nature strapped to it


2 Thessalonians
       The Thessalonians’ curiosity about end-time prophecy has made them a favorite by all those 
down to our present age who pine for answers to eschatology questions. It’s as though this is a follow-
up letter to Paul’s response to the first letter, or perhaps another one. Though the second chapter has 
these answers, from our perspective the answers are cryptic and need second-guessing since we aren’t 
privy to all the letters exchanged. Perhaps that makes it even more tantalizing and enticing to pore over.
       In the meantime, though, the Thessalonians had fallen on hard times and suffered persecutions. 
Unlike some of his other epistles, Paul is quick to point out that the wrath of God will come upon those 
who incite persecution—not the “turn the other cheek” stereotype. Paul closes with a defense of his 
conduct among them, particularly how hard he worked to earn his keep, and that others must do the 
same.
       The text is typical of Paul’s epistles. Paul uses a wider range of vocabulary than one finds in the 
Gospels, to put things in perspective.

1|From Paul, Silas, and Timothy:
      To the church in Thessalonica in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
          
2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
3|We ought to thank God for you all the time, comrades[a]—as it’s worth 
doing—because your faith is growing off the charts, and the love which every one of you 
has towards each other is proliferating, 
4|so much so that we personally are speaking 
with pride about you in the churches of God because of your perseverance and faith 
during all the persecutions and extreme difficulties which you endure, 
5|evidence of 
the just and fair deliberation[b] of God in deeming you worthy of the kingdom of God, 
which—incidentally—you suffer for. 
6|At the end of the day, it’s right in God’s view 
to pay back those who’re causing you extreme difficulties[c] 
7|and for you who are on 
the receiving end of these extreme difficulties they’re causing to get a payback from God in 
the form of relief (a relief shared with us) in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven 
with his almighty angels[d] 
8|with a scorching flame of fire[e] meting out[f] vengeance on 
those who don’t know God and to those who don’t obey the Gospel (i.e., the message) 
of our Lord Jesus; 
9|and—indeed—those very people will pay for it in a punishment of 
doom and destruction issued forth from the face (i.e., scrutinized closely and as a result of 
that scrutiny issued forth) of the Lord and from the glory of his might (i.e., issued forth 
by his power manifested in all its magnificent splendor), 
10|when he happens to 
come to be vested in glory among[g] his saints (i.e., his people) and to be beheld, 
marveled, and admired among all those who have believed—since what we told you to 
be true in a dead-serious manner was believed—on that day.
          
11|We also pray all the time for you with this goal in mind: so that our God 
would deem you worthy of the calling you have to be one of His people and would cause 
all sorts of goodness’s good-will and all sorts of deeds of faith in power to proliferate,

1|Now we’re asking you, comrades[a], on behalf of the coming of our Lord 
Jesus Christ and our being rallied to him, 
2|for you not to be jarred from the frame of 
mind one maintains as a Christian nor be inwardly disturbed or troubled either because of 
a strong, prevailing attitude[b], a concept, a piece of information, or a letter you received 
like one you would receive from us, claiming that the day of the Lord has arrived 
already. 
3|Don’t let anyone delude you in any way, because it won’t come unless the 
“apostasy[A]” (i.e., the great falling away from the faith) comes first and the Man of 
Lawlessness (i.e., the man who’s completely unconstrained by any law, any moral 
principle, or any godly code defining right and wrong), the Son of Destruction-Causing 
(i.e., the one who takes it as his personal mission to destroy), is revealed, 
4|the 
adversary to and the one who raises himself above everything which is said to be God-
related or is an object of worship or devotion, so much so that he takes a seat (i.e., he 
sets up his court, his courtroom, his office) in the temple of God, advertising himself to 
everyone that he is a god.
          
5|Don’t you remember that when I was still staying with you I kept telling you 
these things? 
6|And now you know for a fact the thing that restrains him from being 
revealed in his own time[B]. 
7|In fact the mystery of this lawlessness[c] is already in 
action, it’s just that he who restrains[d] him from being revealed at the moment will continue 
to do so until he happens to disappear from the middle of it all; 
8|and then the Lawless-
One will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will put to death by blowing on him[e] and 
will annihilate him by the outward show of the brilliant splendor of his coming, 
9|he 
whose coming is a reflection of Satan in action with all sorts of phony power, signs, and 
wonders (i.e., miracles; miracles for the purpose of proving one’s legitimacy; awe-
inspiring miracles) 
10|and with every kind of self-delusion[f] which has 
unrighteousness as its source by those following a trajectory of perdition, because they 
didn’t receive the love of the truth resulting in their being saved (i.e., spared 
damnation). 
11|And because of this God will send them an activity of deception 
with the goal of and resulting in their believing in the lie, 
12|so that he would be 
given the opportunity to judge every person who hasn’t believed in the truth but has 
preferred to believe in the unrighteousness of the lie instead.
          
13|But we ought to thank God for you all the time, comrades, you who are 
loved by the Lord, because God chose you, His crème de la crème[g], to salvation (i.e., 
being spared spiritual and physical destruction) in the Holy Spirit and in the true faith. 

14|With this ends in mind, he called you through our Gospel (i.e. our message) to 
the acquisition of the same type of glory as our Lord Jesus Christ has. 
15|So then, 
comrades, stand and keep standing in and get ahold of and keep holding onto the 
bylaws, code of conduct, and best-practices established in perpetuity[h], which you 
received whether by a message spoken to you in person or through one of our letters.

us everlasting comfort, consolation, and good hope by means of grace, 
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]strong, prevailing attitude…Lit: spirit
*[c]this lawlessness…Lit: the lawlessness (ἀνομία/Strong’s 458). Gk: anomia (feminine). Note that the Gk. 
word for Lawless-One in v. 7 is anomos (masculine). Paul’s making a distinction by using these slightly 
different words: anomia refers to a quality, whereas anomos (ἄνομος/Strong’s 459) refers to a person, 
the embodiment of these qualities.
*[d]he who restrains…Gk. o katexōn [ὁ κατέχων, (κατέχων/Strong’s 2722)]. This is not quite the same as 
what’s in v. 6, which is to katexon (τὸ κατέχον, (κατέχον/Strong’s 2722)]. Although the definite articles 
are both neuter/masculine, the substantive of the first is masculine while the second in neuter. This 
suggest that it’s “he who restrains” not “the thing that restrains.” Ref. note of v. 7.
*[e]by blowing on him…Lit: by the wind of his mouth
*[f]self-delusion…Also: deceit. Same word used in Mark 4:19; ref. note there.
*[g]crème de la crème…Lit: first-fruits. Ref. note of Rom. 8:23.
*[h]bylaws, code of conduct, and best-practices established in perpetuity…Lit: traditions

*[A]apostasy…The Gk. word apostasia (ἀποστασία/Strong’s 646). The NASB defines this as “a falling away 
from the faith.” Some Gk. scholars disagree with this and claim that it means “departure” instead, citing 
sources such as the Geneva Bible, Tyndale’s translation, the Great Bible, Kenneth Wuest, and John 
Lineberry. Their reasoning for choosing “departure” over “a falling away” is that aphistāmi 
(ἀφίστημι/Strong’s 868), the root verb from which apostasia is derived, means to depart. Furthermore, 
they say that apostasia (the noun form) only occurs twice in the NT, here in 1 Thess. 2:3 and over in Acts 
21:21. Although the context of Acts 21:21 suggests that apostasia means “falling away” rather than 
“departure,” the critics claim that this isn’t sufficient evidence to negate the core meaning of aphistāmi. 
However, what these dissenters fail to take into consideration is the use of apostasia in the LXX. 
Apostasia is found in Josh. 22:22; 2 Chron. 29:19; 2 Chron. 33:19; Jer. 2:19. In all four cases, apostasia 
means “rebellion, unfaithfulness, backsliding.” In other words, it means the same thing as “a falling 
away from the faith.” Paul read from the LXX frequently and extensively (it might’ve even been his 
primary study-Bible), and he was familiar with the occurrences and usages of apostasia in these 
passages and was mimicking its usage here in v. 3. But in any case, between the LXX and Acts. 21:21, 
there are five occurrences of apostasia in the Bible apart from 2:3 here. In five of the five occurrences—
100% of the time—the meaning of apostasia is “a falling away from the faith.” The sixth must mean the 
same also, the one here in v. 3.
[B]the thing that restrains him from being revealed in his own time…Lit: the restraint for him to be 
revealed in his [or its] own time. The “thing that restrains” in v. 7 is the Gk. to katexon (a form of o 
katexon), where to is the neuter definite article and katexon is the neuter participle form of the verb 
katexō (κατέχω/Strong’s 2722), which literally means to have down upon.

1|In conclusion, pray for us, comrades[a], so that the word of the Lord would 
spread rapidly[b] and would be glorified just as it did with you 
2|and that we would 
be rescued from the perverse[c] and wicked people who resist us: not everyone follows the 
Faith, you see. 
3|But the Lord is faithful, who will cause us to stand and will guard us 
from the Evil One. 
4|I’ve reached the point where I’m convinced in the Lord of good 
things where you’re concerned, because you are doing and will do what we charged 
you with. 
5|May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the 
steadfastness and endurance of Christ.
          
6|Now we charge you, comrades, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (i.e., by 
the authority given to us by Jesus Christ) to stay away from all comrades who conduct 
themselves with a blatant disregard for the rules which have been set in place and not 
according to the bylaws, code of conduct, and best-practices established in perpetuity[d] 
which you received from us. 
7|In this regard you know in yourselves from first-hand 
experience how necessary it is for you to follow our example, since we didn’t disregard 
the rules when we were among you, 
8|nor did we mooch any meals from anyone[e]—
uh-uh—we were toiling day and night doing back-breaking labor so we wouldn’t be a 
burden on any of you— 
9|Not that we don’t have the right to make you provide boarding 
for us, but we choose to do what we did instead so that we could offer ourselves to you as 
an example for you to imitate.
          
10|And in fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you to obey this 
rule: If a given person doesn’t want to work then don’t let him have a meal at 
mealtime[A]. 
11|In fact we hear that there are some people among you going about 
not following the rules, not doing any work but goofing off[B] instead. 
12|To such 
people we charge and advise in the Lord Jesus Christ certain admonishments so that by 
keeping quiet while working they would eat their own meal (i.e., would be entitled to 
receive a meal).
          
13|But you, comrades—don’t get tired of doing good. 
14|But if 
someone won’t obey the message we’re giving you by this letter were sending, take note of 
this guy: don’t associate with or get mixed up with him, so that he’ll be put to shame. 

15|And don’t think of him as an enemy, but warn and admonish him as a comrade 
instead.
          
16|May the Lord of Peace himself grant you the peace throughout every 
circumstance in every place[f].
      May the Lord be with you all.
          
17|The greeting written here is in Paul’s handwriting, which is a 
distinguishing feature of every letter I write:
        THIS IS THE WAY I WRITE[C].
          
*[a]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[b]spread rapidly…Lit: run
*[c]perverse…Lit: not in place
*[d]bylaws, code of conduct, and best-practices established in perpetuity…Lit: traditions
*[e]mooch any meals from anyone…Lit: ate a gift-bread from anyone
*[f]throughout every circumstance in every place…Lit: through all in all place. The GT is more poetic.

*[A]have a meal at mealtime…Lit: eat. When people congregated, they had a couple people cook for the 
entire group, because that was the most efficient way of handling food preparation up until modern 
times. Everyone would sit down at a table together at the same time, the food would be passed around, 
and it would all be shared. This proscription is to forbid a person from having a seat at the table and 
share in the meal if he didn’t share in the common work also.
*[B]goofing off…Lit: being a busybody; meddling. The Gk. word literally means “to go around the periphery 
of work.” The picture is of someone going here or there when working—or supposedly working. Instead, 
he’s bothering other people who are working, striking up non-work-related conversations, instead of 
getting his own work done. The assertion that this is what this Gk. means is confirmed by the statement 
in v. 12 which says to “keeping quiet while working.” Nothing has changed since ancient times!
[C]THIS IS THE WAY I WRITE…With this remark, Paul is demonstrating what is handwriting looks like, so 
they can tell if a forger sent a forgery. Also, it’s a personal touch, sort of like signing one’s signature at 
the bottom of a typed letter.


1 Timothy
       Paul’s instructions to one of his closest assistants, his “dear son” Timothy, has been broadened 
into guidelines which all Christian churches should follow. Paul doesn’t just give sterile rules to do this, 
that, and the other, but gets into the details of what’s going on inside the hearts and minds of various 
people—especially the nefarious ones, adding a lot of color to the epistles he sent to Timothy.
       The text is typical of Paul: mastery of Greek, an extensive vocabulary, Western thought, 
ambiguous in parts due to its brevity or to knowledge privy to the writer and the reader.

1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our savior 
and Christ Jesus our hope:
          
2|To Timothy, a genuine son[a] in the Faith:
      Grace, mercy, peace—from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
          
3|Just as I advised you to remain in Ephesus while on my way to Macedonia so 
that you would impress upon certain individuals not to go about teaching things which 
are…shall we say…different[b] 
4|or to take myths or endless genealogies seriously (the 
very things which generate a lot of stupid questions), more seriously than one takes godly 
stewardship, a stewardship which is by means of faith[c]. 
5|But the bottom line of the 
command that they’re charged with is love from a clean heart and a good conscience, 

6|of which a few people in particular have veered off into a ditch of senseless 
discussion, 
7|wanting to be instructors in the Law of Moses, not understanding what 
they’re saying or the implications of what they insist is true.
          
8|Now we know that the Law is just fine if someone were to use it legitimately, 

9|knowing this for certain: law (i.e., the Law of Moses in particular or any code of 
right and wrong for that matter) was put in place for a reason, not for someone who 
lives right but for the lawless, for those who refuse to submit to authority, for those who 
aren’t pious, for those who murder their fathers, their mothers, their brothers, 

10|for fornicators (i.e., those who indulge in gross sexual immorality), for 
homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and for anyone who supplants what’s been 
put into place with something different than healthy doctrine, 
11|doctrine which is 
in line with the glorious Gospel of the God Who is blessed, doctrine that I’ve been 
entrusted with.
          
12|I have grace for my empowerment in Christ Jesus our Lord, since he 
trusted me enough to make me a minister[d], 
13|me who used to be a blasphemer, a 
persecutor, and one who was insolent and violent—but no—He showed mercy since I 
did these things when I didn’t know better while I was in unbelief, 
14|and the grace 
of our Lord proliferated out of bounds with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
          
15|This statement is trustworthy and from any point of view is worth being 
accepted: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, I myself being the foremost. 

16|In spite of this I was shown mercy, so that in me foremost Christ Jesus would 
demonstrate every kind of patience imaginable, with a view towards those in the future 
who will be believing in[e] him resulting in eternal life.
          
17|Now to the King of the eternities—to the Incorruptible, Invisible, 
Singular God—be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen (i.e., let us pause a moment 
for that remark to sink in).
          
18|These things I’m charging you with, I entrust to you, Timothy my dear 
son, according to the prophesies over you which were given beforehand to lead you on 
your way, so that you would “serve in the army” so to speak among them and be a fine

prayers (i.e., generic prayers), intercessions (i.e., a two-way exchange in prayer), and 
giving of thanks[A] for all people, 
2|for kings and for every high-ranking official, so 
that we may spend our time leading a quiet (i.e., free of disturbances, crises, unrest, etc.) 
and tranquil life in piety and dignity in every respect. 
3|This is a good thing to do, is 
acceptable, pleasing, and welcomed when examined by[a] God our Savior, 
4|Who 
wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge and understanding of the 
truth. 
5|The fact of the matter is that there is one God and there is one mediator 
between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 
6|who gave himself to be an 
atonement[b]—the price of redemption; the price to buy someone back—for everyone, to 
be that which serves as proof or makes a solemn statement in every individual period of 
human history[c]—

missionary)—I’m telling you the truth—no lie—an instructor of Gentiles in what true 
faith really is[d].
          
8|After some careful thought, I desire that men in every place pray and pray, 
lifting up holy hands, keeping a distance from anger and plotting. 
9|Likewise, I desire 
that women dress themselves in good taste[e] and choose an attire with modesty and good 
judgment combined with self-control, not dress themselves in an exotic hairstyle[f] and 
with ultra-expensive gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothing[B], 
10|but instead I 
desire that they make themselves beautiful (which is befitting to women sworn to a life of 
piety to God) by good works.

13|The fact 
of the matter is that Adam was first formed out of clay in the Garden of Eden, then Eve was 
formed.

*[A]supplications (i.e., urgent requests), prayers (i.e., generic prayers), intercessions (i.e., a two-way 
exchange in prayer), and giving of thanks …Gk. words deāsis, proseuchā, enteuksis, eucharistia.
Deāsis (δέησις/Strong’s 1162)—a prayer which asks for wants or needs; urgent requests
Proseuchā (προσευχή/Strong’s 4335)—lit: speaking out to. This is the general word for prayer. Since a 
secondary meaning is a place of prayer, it insinuates prayers done in that setting, hence: formal prayers; 
structured prayers; prayers done at a set time.
Enteuksis (ἔντευξις/Strong’s 1783)—lit: a falling in with; a meeting with; a coming together; a 
conference or conversation. The word is rendered intercession. This kind of prayer insinuates a back-and-
forth exchange between two parties; some sort of negotiation. The negotiations can be to suspend a 
judgment incurred because of a violation of the rules or other just circumstances, such as when 
Abraham negotiated with God to spare Sodom and Gomorrah. In Abraham’s case, the intercession was 
done on behalf of another party, but intercession can be done for one’s own self.
Eucharistia (εὐχαριστία/Strong’s 2169)—The giving of thanks to God, which is a kind of prayer.
*[B]in an exotic hairstyle and with ultra-expensive gold jewelry or pearls or expensive clothing…Lit: braided 
hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing. As what Paul writes here is identical to what Peter writes in 
1 Pet. 3:3, this implies that this was a problem in the early church. Since Paul precedes this by saying 
that women should dress in good taste, modestly, and exercise good judgment and self-control, it 
stands to reason that these hairstyling, jewelry, and expensive clothes were not considered to be good 
taste, modest, or indicative of one exercising good judgment. Since we in modern times don’t consider 
the use of hairstyling, jewelry, etc. to be bad taste or indicative of a lack of judgment (except for a few 
very conservative denominations, most of which have reversed their position), this warrants closer 
examination. 
Let’s assume that the amount of gold in piece a jewelry is equivalent to the gold in a Roman Aureus (8g 
of gold), which was valued at 25 Denarii, and let’s assume each Denarius represented a day’s labor. If 
there are 312 working days in a years, this represents around 8% of a laborer’s annual income. So from 
the perspective of us in modern times, if a person earns $50,000 a year, an 8g piece of gold jewelry 
would cost around $5000 in today’s money (and the same 8g of gold goes for around $500 nowadays). 
This means that gold jewelry was more expensive for them back then that it is for us, as this 
hypothetical example shows an 8-to-1 difference then to now.
So it was more expensive, in terms of purchasing power, for the average woman to dress in the way that 
Peter and Paul admonish them not to than it is for a woman to dress herself today in the same way. It 
may be that these women were spending outrageous amounts of money on their dress, and from the 
remarks Peter and Paul made, were investing their self-image in their ability to dress lavishly and were 
trying to imitate the world, including the lasciviousness of worldly women.
The lesson that modern-day Christian women should learn is to recognize the root-problems here and 
not be so concerned about the letter of the law. Women shouldn’t be obsessed with dressing in clothing 
that they can’t afford, trying to imitate those in the world who live an ungodly life, or base their self-
image on the way they look. Being beautiful on the inside is more important than trying to make oneself 
beautiful on the outside.
*[C]woman…The Gk. words rendered man and woman are anār (ἀνήρ/Strong’s 435) and gunaika 
(γυνή/Strong’s 1135), which are also the same words rendered husband and wife. The ambiguity 
(ambiguity…I thought Gk. was this ultra-specific language?) is resolved by context. When Paul leaves 
instructions for the anār and the gunaika in Ephesians and Colossians, the context is obvious: the 
rendering is husband and wife. Here also the rendering is context-dependent. Is Paul talking about 
husbands and wives or men and women? Most translations choose men and women. To justify it being 
husbands and wives, there must be something in the context that indicates that this is the case. The 
evidence in that favor is that vv. 11,12 are similar to 1 Cor. 14:33–36, which we know was addressed to 
wives. Also, v. 15 talks about bearing children, which means that it’s addressed to wives. The subject is 
omitted from the sentence of v. 15, relying on the verb conjugation in conjunction with the context to 
insinuate that the subject is she. It Gk., it’s not common to have the subject omitted entirely. In lieu of 
its total omission, a definite article is used as a pronoun, as a definite article is short, perhaps is even a 
proclitic. But by omitting the subject entirely, the writer assumes that the reader knows beyond any 
doubt that the subject to be used is easily insinuated by the context. Such is the case. Through this 
insinuation, v. 15 is tightly bound to the context. Therefore, since v. 15 addresses wives, not women, 
coupled with the similarity between this passage and 1 Cor. 14:33–36, one may put forth a weighty 
argument that the entire context of vv. 11–15 is of wives specifically, not of women in general.
*[D]total submissiveness…Lit: all submission. Ref. notes of Eph. 5:22; 1 Pet. 2:18 which explain the 
difference between submit and obey.
*[E]give instructions for what a person should or shouldn’t do…Also: teach. The Gk. word didaskō 
(διδάσκω/Strong’s ). The meaning of this word extends beyond mere definition of the English word to 
teach, and includes giving instruction as to what rules a person must follow. It’s used this way in Acts 
15:1 (ref. note there). Since what follows the word didaskō here in v. 12 is “dominate” and “give 
orders,” it stands to reason that didaskō is used in this context to refer to giving instructions on what 
rules one should follow more so than meaning teaching (explaining).
Now, in vv. 13, 14, Paul gives the reasons why a woman shouldn’t be giving instruction. First is the fact 
that Adam was created before Eve and is therefore receives the leadership position. Second, women are 
more easily deceived, more so than men (cults usually have more women than men, for example), and 
for this reason are less qualified to be instructors. In spite of this, Titus 1:3 allows women to be teachers.
*[F]Plus Adam was not deceived by the serpent but the woman, once deceived, found herself in 
transgression…We must keep in mind that Paul credits Adam—not Eve—with the original sin (Rom. 
5:14), in spite of centuries of Christian teaching to the contrary. Though both Adam and Eve sinned in 
the garden, Adam was not deceived when he partook of the forbidden fruit, and this makes his sin more 
heinous than Eve’s, as—according to this verse here—he knew exactly what he was doing when he bit 
the fruit. It was bold-faced disobedience in light of the full understanding and recollection of God’s 
commandment.
[G]spared calamity through the childbearing years …Lit: saved the childbearing. The Gk. word saved 
rendered spared calamity here is not in reference to her receiving Christ. Some that this is a promise for 
a woman escape death or harm when giving birth, which up until modern times was a serious threat to a 
woman’s well-being.

15|But she will be spared 
calamity[G] through the childbearing years if she were to continue in faith, love, and 
holiness with good judgment combined with self-control[h].

1|You can count on this statement being true: if someone aspires to be a 
bishop[a] (i.e., a head pastor), he desires to do something excellent[b]. 
2|So a bishop 
candidate must have no moral character flaws[c]; must be the husband of one woman[A] 
(i.e., not divorced and remarried); self-controlled and exercise moderation in vices such 
as drinking; be sensible, serious, and level-headed; be respected, held in high esteem, 
and honorable; be hospitable, able to reach out to others, and likes and can work with 
people who are different than himself; be capable of giving instructions to others or 
teaching them; 
3|not be a heavy drinker or have a drinking problem; not a bully, a 
brawler, or someone who gets into fights, but yielding, gentle, courteous, and tolerant 
instead, and avoids fights; not fondly attached to money; 
4|does a good job of 
presiding over his household; keeps his children in obedience with them being respectful 
in all respects (
5|but if someone can’t preside over his own household, how will he 
look after God’s household?); 
6|not a newbie, so that he won’t become full of himself 
or conceited and fall to the Accuser’s (the Devil’s) true accusations of guilt. 

7|Outsiders must have a good report to give about him, so that he won’t fall into 
disgrace: the Accuser’s trap[d].
          
8|Likewise, deacons[a] (i.e., associate pastors and ministry directors) must be 
honorable and respectable; not insincere or say one thing one moment and contradict it 
another; not consumed with drinking[e]; not always trying to make a fast buck through 
shady business practices; 
9|possessing the mystery of the Faith in a clean conscience. 

10|Let these candidates first be examined and approved, then let them serve as 
deacons after being found to have no moral character flaws.
          
11|The ministers’ wives must be honorable and respectable as well; not 
slanderers; self-controlled and exercising moderation in vices such as drinking; faithful 
in all respects. 
12|Make sure[f] deacons are the husbands of one wife (i.e., have not 
been divorced and remarried); do a good job of presiding over their children and over 
their household. 
13|In fact, those who have done a good job serving as a deacon 
take a big step forward in their own lives[g] and acquire much boldness and confidence 
in the Faith which is in Christ Jesus.
          
14|I’m writing these things to you and hoping to visit you post-haste. 

15|But in case I’m delayed, I’m writing these things to you now so that you would 
know for a fact how the house of God, which very thing is the church of the Living God, 
a pillar and a chief supporting base of the truth, must be run[h]. 
*[a]bishops…deacons…Ref. note of 1 Cor. 15:24
*[b]he desires to do something excellent…Lit: he desires of a good work
*[c]moral character flaws…Or: unimpeachable. The NASB renders this “beyond reproach.”
*[d]disgrace: the Accuser’s trap…Lit: disgrace and a snare of the Devil. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[e]not consumed with drinking…Lit: not occupied with [drinking] a lot of wine
*[f]make sure…Lit: let
*[g]take a big step forward in their own lives…Lit: acquire an excellent step in themselves
*[h]run…Also: conducted; have as a lifestyle
*[i]in spirit…Or: in [the] Spirit. Though the GT is ambiguous, the preceding stanza’s “in the flesh” skews the 
resolution to in spirit rather than in the Spirit.

*[A]the husband of one woman…This covers both polygamy (incidentally) and marriage, divorce, then 
remarriage (primarily). Many interpret this proscription as applying to polygamy, but polygamy wasn’t 
practiced in the parts of the Roman Empire where Paul’s churches were. Furthermore, in 5:9 when Paul 
is talking about widows, he says that she should be “the wife of one man.” This is the same wording in 
GT as “husband of one woman,” except in reverse. If “husband of one woman” were talking about 
polygamy—in this case, a single man having multiple wives at the same time—then “wife of one man” 
would have to be talking about a single woman having multiple husbands at the same time—something 
which is unheard of.
[B]mystery…The “mystery of piety” here and the mystery of “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Col. 1:27) 
refines the definition of mystery as used in the NT: a “mystery” is something which is profound.

1 Timothy
16|And great, 
admittedly, is the mystery[B] of piety:

He who appeared in the flesh
Was declared righteous in spirit[i]
Was seen by angels
Was preached to the Gentiles
Was believed by the world
Was taken up in glory

1|The Spirit says explicitly that in later periods of human history[a] some will 
revolt[b] from the Faith, their attention occupied by deceiving spirits and doctrines or 
teachings of demons, 
2|telling lies in hypocrisy, having reached the point where 
they’ve seared their own conscience, 
3|hindering or preventing getting married, 
abstaining from foods that God created to be taken and consumed with thanksgiving by 
those who believe and have perceived, recognized, and understood the truth. 
4|And 
they are free to partake because God’s entire creation is excellent, and nothing which is 
received with thanksgiving is to be rejected, 
5|for the food which you eat is designated 
holy on account of the word of God and on account of a request offered in prayer.
          
6|By teaching the comrades[c] these things until they’re built into them, you’ll 
be a fine minister[d] of Christ Jesus, firming up the words of the Faith and of the quality 
teaching which you have closely followed. 
7|Refuse to receive things which are profane 
and desecrated, things which are old wives’ tales. Put yourself on a training program 
(like you do at the gym) towards building yourself up in piety. 
8|Physical training, you 
see, is beneficial to a small degree, but piety is beneficial in every respect, holding a 
promise of life (i.e., that special fullness of life) in the present time and in the time to 
come.
          
9|You can count on that statement I just made being true, and it deserves to be 
accepted any way you look at it. 
10|In fact we work hard and strive for this, since 
we have set our hope on the Living God, Who is the Savior of all people, especially those 
who believe.
          
11|Charge the comrades with these things and instruct them in them. 

12|Don’t let anyone think less of you or treat you disrespectfully because you’re 
young, but instead become an example for the believers to follow in speech, in manner, 
in love, in faith, in purity (and the list goes on).
          
13|Stay busy with Scripture reading, with exhortation and encouragement, 
with teaching (and the list goes on) until I get there. 
14|Don’t neglect the spiritual 
gift[e] in you which was given to you through prophecy and accompanied by the laying 
on of hands by the elders (i.e., the church board). 
15|Put these things I’m writing to 
you about into practice; be in them (i.e., be totally into them), so that your progress will 
be quite noticeable to everyone.

16|Pay close attention to yourself—how you are 
and what you do—and to your doctrine and teaching. Immerse yourself in them. You 
see, by so doing, you’ll be preserving yourself, protecting yourself, and keeping 
yourself from harm, you and those who listen to you.

1|Don’t chide an older man, speaking to him condescendingly, but address 
him as though he goes by “Mr.”[a], 
2|an older woman like she’s “Mrs.”, an older teen 
to twenties male like he’s your comrade[b], an older teens to twenties female like she’s 
your woman-comrade but with purity in every respect.
          
3|Give financial support to a widow[c] who really is a widow, a woman who is 
destitute because she has no one to live with to help support her. 
4|But if a given widow has 
children or grandchildren, let the children and grandchildren learn that their highest 
priority duty is to their household (i.e., those in their immediate family, the ones they 
currently or used to live with) and that they ought to pay those who were their parents 
and took care of them growing up back with financial compensation; this is pleasing when 
put to the close scrutiny of[d] God, you see.
          
5|Now the widow who’s truly destitute and has reached the point where she’s 
all alone with no one to take care of her—you’ll find that this sort of woman has set her hope 
on God, and that she continuously, consistently prays day and night offering up 
supplications and prayers[e]; 
6|but the self-indulgent, luxury-seeking, pleasure-loving 
woman, though living in terms of the medical definition of being alive, has already died.
          
7|Give the order that these rules be followed, so that there’d be no way anyone 
could point a finger at those who follow them. 
8|But if someone won’t provide for his 
own relatives, especially those of his own household, he’s denied the Faith and is worse 
than an unbeliever.
          
9|Enroll a widow into the church support program if she’s not less than sixty 
years old, the wife of one husband (i.e., not married, divorced, then remarried before 
being a widow); 
10|enroll her if there are eyewitness accounts and testimonies of her 
good deeds; enroll her if she raised children; if she shows hospitality; if she washed the 
saints’ feet (i.e., done demeaning chores for the church and its members); if she helped 
those in distress; if she’s devoted herself to good works of every sort.
          
11|But deny requests to enroll widows who are young: you see, when they 
become overpowered with physical, sensual desires contrary to their vow to Christ[A] in 
their wanting to get married, 
12|they’ll be “guilty as charged” (so to speak) 
because they abandoned their previous obligation. 
13|At the same time they learn 
to be lazy, making the rounds from house to house—not just lazy but they also run at 
the mouth and stick their noses where they’re not wanted, saying things that shouldn’t 
be said.
          
14|So, after thinking about it, I want young widows to get married, have 
children, and take responsibility for their house and for those in it, so they won’t give 
the Opponent any opportunity to verbally abuse them, scolding and insulting them. 

15|The fact of the matter is that some have already gone in a different direction to 
become ardent followers of Satan[f]. 
16|If a particular woman who is a believer has 
widows in her care[g], have her help them and not be a burden on the church, so that the 
ones who really are widows and are destitute as such may be helped.
          
17|Let the elders (i.e., those on the church board) who do a good job of 
running things be entitled to twice their pay[h], especially those who work hard at 
speaking and teaching. 
18|You see, the Scripture says “do not muzzle the ox while 
threshing” and “the worker is entitled to his paycheck.”
          
19|Don’t accept an accusation of wrongdoing against an elder except if it’s 
leveled by two or three people who solemnly swear that it’s true.
          
20|Expose those who are sinners in front of everyone, so that everyone will 
become afraid of sinning.
          
21|I solemnly affirm these things and declare them to be true before God, 
Christ Jesus, and the special angels[j], so that you would guard these things without 
prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism.
          
22|Don’t be too eager to lay hands on anyone and thereby make them a 
minister nor should you participate in others’ sins: keep yourself unsullied.
          
23|Don’t just drink water only anymore, but use a little wine as a medicine of a 
sort because of your stomach and your frequent ailments[k].
          
24|For some people, their sins are obvious, paraded before them with much 
fanfare for everyone to see in front of them on their way to judgment; but some come 
right behind them, quietly, unannounced, and unexpected by everyone[B]. 

*[a]address him as though he goes by “Mr.”…Lit: entreat as father
*[b]comrade…Lit: brother
*[c]give financial support to a widow…Lit: honor [give honorariums to] a widow
*[d]when put to the close scrutiny of…Lit: before
*[e]supplications and prayers…Ref. note of 2:1
*[f]become ardent followers of Satan…Or: become disciples of Satan…Lit: behind Satan. A NT expression; 
ref. note of Matt. 4:19.
*[g]If a particular woman who is a believer has widows in her care…I’m unsure whether this is correct
*[h]twice their pay…Lit: double honor [honorarium]
*[i]chosen…Or: special
*[j]special angels…Lit: chosen angels. This might be a reference to the seraphim and cherubim.
*[k]ailments…Lit: weaknesses. Ref. note of John 5:3.

*[A]overpowered with physical, sensual desires contrary to their vow to Christ…The single Gk. word 
rendered overpowered with physical, sensual desires is a word Paul coins here, not found anywhere else. 
Paul may be referring to sexual desire, or he may be referring to the desire of a woman to become more 
affluent through marriage, which would bring those extra creature-comforts she misses in her poverty 
(or both perhaps.) To this second point, the root for this Gk. word appears in Rev. 18:7,9, and is 
rendered luxury there.
[B]paraded before them with much fanfare for everyone to see in front of them on their way to judgment; 
but some come right behind them, quietly, unannounced, and unexpected by everyone…Lit: going before 
to judgment; but some follow right behind. A metaphor of the victory parade of a general who’s won a 
great victory and wishes to flaunt his victory when he marches into the city. The procession is 
orchestrated so that, when arriving in the city, the spoils of war, the glitz, the glamor go first. This is 
done to attract attention and applause and to drum up awe and excitement. Then comes the general. 
After him comes the slaves he’s captured, etc. They get little attention. In the metaphor, the sins of 
some people are well-known, everyone has talked and talked about them, dissecting every bit of the evil 
deed. But the sins of some people are a well-kept secret, but they will make their way to judgment.

1|Anyone at all who’s forced to be a slave[a], let him esteem his master worthy 
of total honor, so that God’s reputation and the things the church believes in not be bad-
mouthed. 
2|They who have masters who are believers mustn’t despise them because 
they’re fellow-comrades[b], but should serve them all the more, because they are faithful 
and beloved, they who are having a surrogate take their place in assisting them in 
what’s beneficial.
      Give instructions in these matters and exhort and encourage them to follow them. 

3|If anyone teaches things which are…shall we say…different[A], and isn’t headed in 
the direction of delivering sound messages, namely messages of our Lord Jesus Christ and 
teaching in line with godliness, 
4|then he’s become conceited, understanding nothing, 
but has a sick desire for debates and controversies instead, out of which he becomes 
envious, engages in quarrelling and strife, he slanders, becomes paranoid, 

5|constantly arguing with people who are morally depraved whose mind is also 
deprived of the truth, of the opinion that godliness is a means of gain—

gain. 
7|We brought nothing with us into the world when we were born, you see, and we 
sure can’t[c] take anything out of it. 
8|Regular meals and adequate clothing—we’ll be 
satisfied with these things. 
9|But those who want and plan to get richer and richer[B] 
fall into temptation, into a trap, and into many strong desires which are unintelligent, 
dull-witted, and harmful. 
10|The fact of the matter is that a potential root-cause of 
every type of the evils you see in the world is the love of money, which some who’ve 
made it their goal to get rich have veered off from the Faith and have skewered 
themselves through with a spit (like when roasting meat), skewering themselves all 
over with a lot of misery, with many mental pains, and with a tremendous amount of 
undue suffering.
          
11|Now you, oh man of God—run away as fast as you can from these 
things. Pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, gentleness, and the list goes on. 

12|Fight the good fight of the Faith. Grab and hold onto that special fullness of life, 
eternal life, to which ends you were called and for which you confessed the Good 
Confession before many witnesses.
          
13|I charge you before God the Life-Causer of everything and Christ Jesus 
who submitted the Good Confession as testimony to Pontius Pilate 
14|to keep the 
commandment I just wrote spotless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, 
15|which appearance he will indicate in separate eras of time, he the 
blessed and singular authority, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords, 
16|the 
one having immortality, whose resides in unapproachable light which no one has seen 
or is able to stare at: to him be honor and might forever. Amen (i.e., let us pause a 
moment for that remark to sink in).
          
17|Charge those who are rich in this present age not to be high-minded or to 
set their hope on the uncertainty of wealth, but to instead set it on God the One Who 
richly makes available to us all sorts of things for our enjoyment, 
18|and makes these 
things available to us so we can be doing good things to others, so that we can become 
richer in top-notch works, so that they can be generous, willing to share, 
19|storing 
away for themselves a good nest egg[d] for the future, so that they would grab and hold 
onto what life really is.
          
20|Oh, Timothy, guard what’s been entrusted to you, avoid the desecrated, 
profane kind of useless chatter and the contradictions of so-called knowledge and 
understanding, 
*[a]forced to be a slave…Lit: servants under the yoke. The Gk. word doulos (δοῦλος/Strong’s 1401), which 
is either servant or slave, is narrowed in scope to mean slave and not servant by the phrase under the 
yoke. Also, plural words in this verse changed to singular for readability.
*[b]fellow-comrades…Lit: brothers
*[c]and we sure can’t…Lit: since we can’t. Various manuscripts differ here, and probably because what’s in 
several of the better manuscripts makes little sense.
*[d]nest egg…Lit: foundation

*[A]teaches things which are…shall we say…different…All these are the single Gk. verb heterdidsakō 
(ἑτεροδιδασκαλέω/Strong’s 2085), “to different-teach.” This word only appears twice in the NT; Paul 
appears to have coined it. From the sound of it, he’s describing those who teach things which are 
perhaps novel, appealing, and sound good on the surface. Paul isn’t saying they are necessarily false 
teachings, they’re just different and warrant keeping a close eye on, because there may be a false 
doctrine lurking under the guise of a new, welcoming message.
[B]richer and richer…The tense of the Gk. verb insinuates continual action; in other words, Paul’s not 
talking about someone who simply wants to become wealthy, and once they attain that goal are 
satisfied and quit, but he’s talking about someone who continually wants to get richer and richer with no 
end in sight.


2 Timothy
       The strong emotions which Paul had while in prison are put in this second letter to Timothy, 
Paul’s final letter. One can feel the intensity when reading it, feeling something in the air, feeling that 
things are getting serious, that events have taken a turn for the worse, that the end is near. He breaks 
out into poem in the second chapter an prayer in the fourth.
       Paul’s attachment to his son in the Faith Timothy is one of the few things which gives him the 
inner strength to persevere; except for Luke he is alone.

Jesus.
          
3|I thank God and have gracious thoughts for Him, Whom I serve with a clean 
conscience in a worship which originated from my ancestors, as I constantly rehash 
memories of you all day and all night while I’m chained up in prison, 
4|yearning so 
much to see you (now that I’ve remembered something of your tears) so that I could be 
filled with joy, 
5|now that I’ve taken in a memory of the sincere faith in you: the very 
faith which first resided in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice—and I am 
convinced is in you too. 
6|It’s for this reason that I’m reminding you to stir up the gift 
of God, a gift which is in you through my laying on of hands. 
7|You see, God didn’t 
give us a deep, intense, overriding attitude[b] of cowardliness, but of power, love, and a 
self-control which results in us being sensible and sound-minded.
          
8|So don’t be ashamed of us telling others in a serious manner what the truth is 
about[c] our Lord nor be ashamed about me his prisoner, but rather participate in the evil-
generated sufferings inherent to the Gospel (God’s message of love and forgiveness) in 
lockstep with the power of God, 
9|Who saved us and called us (i.e., summoned us to 
be believers) by a holy calling, not according to our works but rather according to the 
intention which He decided beforehand and according to His grace instead, which was 
given to us in Christ Jesus before time immemorial[d], 
10|but has been made visible 
for everyone to see through the manifestation of our savior Christ Jesus, now that he on 
the one hand abolished the death mankind was beset with while he shined here on Earth, 
but on the other hand gave us life and immortality through the Gospel. 
11|Towards 
that goal I have been given the positions of preacher, apostle (i.e., missionary), and 
teacher.

glory.
          
11|You can count on this passage[d] being true:

For if we died together, we shall also live together.

12|If we endure, we shall also reign together.
If we’re going to deny him,
That’s the same person who’ll deny us.

13|If we refuse to believe in him,
That’s the same person who’ll remain true to his word;
He can’t deny himself, you see.

          
14|Remind them of these things while solemnly declaring them before God as 
the sworn truth; remind them to not fight over words that serve no useful purpose and at 
their core cause disarray to the listeners.
          
15|Be fanatical about having God examine you and giving you His 
approval[e], a laborer who has nothing to be ashamed of, competently handling[B] the 
truth of the word of God[f]. 
16|But avoid the desecrated, profane kind of chattering; 
you see, when that sort of chatter proliferates, irreverence and ungodliness will make 
progress— 
17|and their message will eat through you like gangrene, among whom 
are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
18|particular individuals who’ve veered off into a 
ditch with respect to the truth, saying that we’re already living in the afterlife[g] and by 
saying this subvert some people’s faith. 
19|Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation is 
left standing intact, having this distinguishing identification mark: “The Lord knows 
those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord (i.e., who 
acknowledges the greatness that the Lord is known to be) depart from 
unrighteousness.”
          
20|Now in a large estate’s manor there are not just jars, pots, and vases made 
out of gold and silver but also jars, pots, and vases made out of wood and clay, and some 
made for honorable use (i.e., decorative pieces, serving dishes, etc.) and some for 
dishonorable use (i.e., wash basins, chamber pots, etc.). 
21|Now if someone were to 
purge these things I’m writing about from himself, he will be a jar, pot, or vessel for 
honorable use, reserved for special use only, quite useful for the master of the estate, ready 
to be used for something good on any special occasion[C].
          
22|Now run away as fast as you can from strong desires (including sexual) 
characteristic of teenagers and young adults; pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, 
and the list goes on with those who call upon the Lord (i.e., invite the Lord into their 
lives) from a clean heart. 
23|But avoid the stupid, foolish, uninformed, uneducated 
questions that circulate, knowing from firsthand experience that they generate strife. 
          
24|Now the Lord’s servant mustn’t quarrel but instead should be kind, 
teachable, endure injuries,

self-restraint, if perchance God grant them the grace to change their minds resulting in 
them recognizing the truth,

message of prophecy which was given to Paul.
*[e]Be fanatical about having God examine you and giving you His approval…Lit: Be eager to present 
yourself approved by God
*[f]the truth of the word of God…Lit: the word of the truth. A figure of speech.

*[A]The hard-working farmer must be the first one to partake of what’s raised on the farm…What this 
means is that a person who teaches others what to do must be the foremost practitioner of what he 
teaches.
*[B]competently handling…Lit: cutting a path or a road in a straight direction. Refers to the skill of a 
laborer. This together with the word laborer is a metaphor, comparing how skilled a laborer is with his 
tools to how skilled a teacher should be with the word of God.
[C]ready to be used for something good on any special occasion…Lit: prepared unto all good work. The 
Gk. word for good is not the word kalos (καλῶς /Strong’s 2773)which Paul uses frequently in such cases, 
and, based on that, one expects to use here, but the word agathos (ἀγαθός/Strong’s 18)instead. 
Agathos means that the nature of the function the pot is to be used for is good itself; hence, it refers to 
a special occasion or the like.

1|Now understand this: in the last days, difficult periods of time will come with 
their difficult conditions. 
2|In connection to this, the people during those periods will be 
selfish; money-loving; they’ll be braggarts; arrogant; they’ll be slanderous, 
blasphemous, bad-mouthing people; they’ll be disobedient to their parents; unforgiving, 
unkind, and ungrateful; they’ll have no piety or religious devotion; 
3|they won’t have 
the love one naturally has for family, for kin, for nation, etc.; they’ll be irreconcilable 
and incapable of negotiating solutions to problems; 
4|they’ll be traitors and will 
betray others; they’ll be rash, impulsive, and reckless; puffed up and conceited; they’ll 
be pleasure-loving more than God-loving; 
5|they’ll have an outward appearance of 
godliness but will have rejected godliness’s power. Go out of your way to avoid those 
sort of people.
          
6|Furthermore, included with these sort of people are those who sneak into the 
houses[A] of certain women and utterly captivate[a] silly women[B] who have a pile of sins a 
mile high, silly women who are led[b] by various intense and impulsive desires (including 
sexual desire), 
7|always learning but never arriving at the recognition and precise 
understanding of the truth. 
8|Now the manner in which Jannes and Jambres opposed 
Moses is the same way that these people oppose the truth, people of depraved minds, 
failing to make the grade where the Faith is concerned. 
9|But never mind that—they 
won’t get very far; the fact is, their folly will be perfectly clear to everyone, as the folly of 
those guys Jannes and Jambres also became perfectly clear to everyone.
          
10|But you now—stick close to my doctrine, my way of life, my plan, my 
love, my perseverance, 
11|to my persecutions, my sufferings, such as what 
happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra—oh, what persecutions I endured—
and the Lord rescued me from all of them. 
12|Everyone who wants to live a life of 
godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
          
13|Evil people and charlatans will make progress for the worse, leading 
others astray and being led astray themselves. 
14|You, though, dwell in the things 
which you learned and came to trust, knowing whom you learned them from, 

15|and that you have known[c] the sacred Scriptures from the time you were a wee 
child, the things that have the power to make you wise in the ways of[d] salvation (i.e., 
ways of preventing being overtaken by calamity) through the faith which is in Christ 
Jesus. 
16|All of Scripture has the breath of God (i.e., is inspired by God) and is 
useful for teaching, for reproof or cross-examination, for improvement, for training in 
righteousness, and the list goes on, 
*[a]utterly captivate…Lit: take captive as a prisoner of war. A metaphor.
*[b]silly women who are led…The noun for silly women is neuter, the participle led is also neuter, like the 
participle for have a pile of sins; therefore the antecedent of led is silly women. For that matter learning 
in v. 7 is also neuter.
*[c]have known…Lit: know
*[d]in the ways of…Lit: unto

*[A]sneak into the houses…If one thinks about this more closely, the men described here who sneak into 
these women’s homes must do so with the cooperation and consent of the women. In other words, they 
cannot be burglars breaking into a house, as the door would be kept locked at night, the woman would 
scream (Deut. 22:24, though these are Gentiles), the man of the house (and there certainly would have 
been) would rescue her, etc. But the woman could find a time when nobody else was home, a time for 
the man to enter the house for a romantic rendezvous, adulterous or just consensual. Naturally, the 
man would have to be careful not to be seen entering the house, hence Paul’s use of the word sneak.
[B]silly women…Lit: little women; more precisely women-ettes [the diminutive form of the word women]. 
This word only appears once in the NT, and the lexicons provide little information about it, except to say 
that it’s pejorative. The fact that it’s a diminutive leads one to speculate that it’s slang of a sort. The 
closest equivalent might be the word bimbo, though that might be too strong a word. We can only guess 
what the exact meaning is.

1|I’m telling you the truth—I solemnly charge you before God and before 
Christ Jesus, who’s going to judge the living and the dead at his appearance, and is 
going to reign as king: 
2|preach the word of God: stay on top of it when the conditions 
are favorable and when they’re not[a]; correct false doctrine and sinful behavior; chide, 
admonish, and rebuke; exhort, encourage, and entreat; do these things with the utmost 
perseverance and with every possible explanation.
          
3|In fact a time will come when the conditions are such that they won’t tolerate 
sound doctrine, but will accumulate teachers who’ll tickle[b] their ears in line with their 
own strong desires instead. 
4|Those teachers will turn the listeners from the truth and 
turn them to fables in their place.

infliction perpetrated against you, do the job of an evangelist, get the maximum amount 
out of[d] your ministry.

poured out on the ground; and the time for me to be set free in death is bearing down on 
me. 
7|I have fought the good fight, I have finished my race, I have kept the Faith. 

8|What remains for me is that the trophy[e] of righteousness has been placed before me, 
which the Lord will give me when that day arrives[f], the just judge—not only will he 
give this crown to me but also to everyone who has come to love his making an 
appearance.

have to say[h]. 
16|During the first defense phase of my trial, no one showed up and 
stood by me; everyone abandoned me instead. May it not be counted against them. 

17|But the Lord stood by me and put power in me, so that, because of me, the 
preaching of the word would reach its maximum extent[d] and all the Gentiles would hear 
the Gospel and hear that he snatched me[i] out of the lion’s mouth.

Empire. What Paul tells Titus is similar—almost exactly the same in points—to what he tells Timothy, 
and from this we can deduce that the guidelines Paul established for running the churches were 
uniform.
       Though Titus is not quoted as much as other books, it is a hidden gem lying in the rough, waiting

&TITUS 1
1|Paul, a menial servant of God but yet an apostle (i.e., a missionary) of Jesus 
Christ according to the Faith of God’s chosen people and the recognition of the truth 
which is reflective of godliness 
2|which rests upon a living hope of eternal life, which 
the God Who Won’t Lie promised before time immemorial[a]— 
3|But He manifested 
His word in individual periods of human history[b] by means of preaching, preaching 
that I was entrusted with according to the commandment of God our Savior:
          
4|To Titus, a real son[c] according to the common Faith:
      Grace and peace from the Father God and Christ Jesus our savior.
          
5|The reason I left you behind in Crete is so that you would tidy up the 
remaining items and would go from city to city and appoint elders (i.e., church board 
members) like I told you to do. 
6|If a given candidate is without moral flaws, the 
husband of one wife (i.e., not divorced and remarried), the children he has are 
trustworthy, not ones who can be fairly accused of having a reckless disregard for their 
own self-preservation or of being rebellious, then he’s met the minimum qualifications to be 
an elder.
          
7|The fact is, a bishop[A] (i.e., a head pastor), as the steward of God’s house, 
must be without moral flaws; not stubborn or self-willed; not hot-tempered; not a heavy 
drinker; not pugnacious or a bully; not always trying to make a fast buck through shady 
business practices; 
8|but instead hospitable, able to reach out to others, one who likes 
and can work with people who are different than himself; a lover of all things good; 
sensible, serious, and level-headed; just and fair; holy; self-controlled, disciplined, and 
having one’s impulses under control; 
9|clinging to the tried-and-true message[d] 
reflective of the doctrine we teach, so that he’d be capable of both exhorting and 
encouraging others in the Sound Doctrine and correcting those who oppose it.
          
10|The fact of the matter is that there are those who refuse to submit to 
authority, those who say nothing when they speak and who are deceivers, especially 
those who came out of the circumcision (i.e., those whose background was that they were 
following the Law of Moses), 
11|who must be silenced, people in particular who 
subvert entire households, teaching things they mustn’t for morally unacceptable gain. 

12|One of their own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, vicious brutes[e], and 
fat blimps[f].”[B] 
13|I’m quoting a reliable source[g]. You must severely correct them 
for this reason: so that they’ll be healthy in the Faith; 
14|so they won’t pay any 
attention to Jewish fables and to the commandments of people who are turning them 
away from the truth.
          
15|All things are clean[C] (i.e., according to the Law of Moses, eligible to be 
touched, handled, and used; absent any defilement) to those who are clean; but to those 
who have been defiled (i.e., who’ve become tainted and are no longer clean) and who 
refuse to believe, nothing is pure—no, not a chance—both their minds and their 
consciences have come to be defiled. 
*[a]time immemorial…Lit: eternal times
*[b]individual periods of human history…Lit: their own seasons. Same phrase used in 1 Tim. 2:6;6:15.
*[c]son…Or: child
*[d]tried-and-true message…Lit: trustworthy word
*[e]vicious brutes…Lit: evil animals
*[f]fat blimps…Lit: free-from-labor bellies. Some liberties taken. The Expositor’s Greek Testament says, “He 
[the poet] has in his mind the belly, as it obtrudes on the beholder and is a burden to the possessor.”
*[g]I’m quoting a reliable source…Lit: the testimony itself is true

*[A]bishop…Ref. note of 1 Cor. 15:24. As vv. 5–6 address qualifications for elders and v. 7 begins with a 
coordinating conjunction, it stands to reason that, at least for the churches Titus was dealing with, 
elders were bishops and vice-versa. This supports the theory that the ancient church was originally run 
by elders but later on transitioned to one which was run by bishops instead.
*[B]”Cretans are always liars, vicious brutes, and fat blimps”…From the sounds of it, this prophet was 
parroting an outrageously false, negative ethnic stereotype about Cretans, which the prophet 
categorically applies to all Cretans. Paul is vehemently condemning that kind of language.
[C]clean…Also: pure. Paul’s usage of clean and defiled here is a metaphor to the OT concepts of clean and 
unclean, concepts which are deeply rooted in the Law of Moses and touch all the temple rituals and 
quite a lot of other things. Once something was defiled (tainted), it could no longer be used in the 
temple service. Care had to be taken to keep or maintain people or things in a state of cleanness.
The metaphor presented here is that a person who’s clean is one who’s pure in mind and spirit, and 
everything that person handles is automatically clean. A person who’s pure will look at any fact, 
teaching, philosophy, etc. and come up with practical applications, anecdotes, life-lessons, analogies, 
etc. which are pure, meaning they’ll support or complement Christian truths, principles, and values. But 
anyone who’s defiled, any fact, teaching, philosophy, etc. will ultimately lead to something twisted, to 
the point of contradicting Christian truths, principles, and values.

makes sound doctrine stand out [or becoming]. Uncertain of the correctness of the rendering.

having been enslaved to much wine.

*[f]would be a feather in the cap (so to speak)…Lit: would adorn. Some liberties taken.
*[g]deny…Also: renounce. Unexpected verb tense used here.

*[A]have a strong friendship with their husbands and enjoy their companionship…Lit: husband-love. Note 
the root word for love used here is not agapā (ἀγάπη/Strong’s 26) but philo. Ref. note of John 12:25 and 
other places for differences in these words. One of the few places in the NT where women are told to 
love their husband, and the love is a philo-love not and agapā -love. Contrast that to Ephesians where 
husbands are commanded to agapā their wives. Philo-love is an enjoyment of the fellowship and 
companionship two people have, like when David loved Jonathan. Agapā -love is a love that sees value 
in the other person, sometimes in spite of what they’re doing, or (and this is in contrast to philo-love) to 
love them without them reciprocating. Philo-love is a reciprocating love; agapā -love is not necessarily 
reciprocal. In the NT, the same root-word philo also means to kiss. In ancient times (and even a bit in 
modern times), kisses were not a token of romantic love, but tokens of friendship, fellowship, and 
personal connection. Women must be taught to philo-love their husbands, because the alternative is to 
become bored with them. When they do, they sometimes go looking for another man to bring 
excitement into their lives.
[B]chaste…Also: pure; holy. The Gk. word hagnos (ἁγνός/Strong’s 53), which is derived from the usual 
word for holy and the word for sanctification. Note that Paul used a different word for holy [hosios, 
(ὅσιος/Strong’s 3741)]in 1 Tim. 2:8, in “lifting up holy hands.” Hosios also appears in 1:8 as a 
characteristic for bishops. One expects to find hosios used in 2:5 here, not hagnos. So the words should 
be more closely examined. The root-meaning of hagnos is separation. In the OT, things which were holy 
were separated from the unclean in order to preserve their holiness. This is hagnos. So when hagnos is 
used in reference to women, it’s talking about a separation—a separation even from men in a sexual 
way. This is how it’s acquired the means of chaste (meaning kept sexually separate) in this verse here. 
Paul might’ve meant chaste exclusively and not pure or holy—we don’t know.

Titus
*[B]chaste…Also: pure; holy. The Gk. word hagnos (ἁγνός/Strong’s 53), which is derived from the usual 
word for holy and the word for sanctification. Note that Paul used a different word for holy [hosios, 
(ὅσιος/Strong’s 3741)]in 1 Tim. 2:8, in “lifting up holy hands.” Hosios also appears in 1:8 as a 
characteristic for bishops. One expects to find hosios used in 2:5 here, not hagnos. So the words should 
be more closely examined. The root-meaning of hagnos is separation. In the OT, things which were holy 
were separated from the unclean in order to preserve their holiness. This is hagnos. So when hagnos is 
used in reference to women, it’s talking about a separation—a separation even from men in a sexual 
way. This is how it’s acquired the means of chaste (meaning kept sexually separate) in this verse here.

15|Communicate these things and encourage, exhort, and correct while 
staying in full control of the situation: don’t let anyone look down on you.


&TITUS 3
1|Keep reminding them to submit to and comply with rulers who have 
legitimate authority over you and to be prepared to do any sort of good deed 
2|without 
saying bad things about what you’re having to do, not being quarrelsome when you’re doing 
it, not being inflexible about every little detail—in every way possible demonstrating a 
gentleness towards people borne out of self-restraint.
          
3|The fact is, we were mindless back then, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to a 
variety of strong desires (including sexual desires) and pleasures, spending our lives in 
malice, in envy, detestable people hating each other. 
4|But when the goodness and 
benevolence of God our Savior shined on us, 
5|it did not originate out of things we did 
in a state of righteousness, but He saved us instead according to His mercy on account of 
a washing of the new birth and a renewal of the Holy Spirit, 
6|which He poured out 
on us copiously through Jesus Christ our savior, 
7|so that, having been made 
righteous in that grace, we heirs would be born to a hope of eternal life (i.e., that special 
fullness of life).
          
8|You can count on this statement being true[a]: I’ve thought about these things, 
and what I want you to do is to emphasize them, so that those who have come to 
believe in God would be intent on prioritizing good works. These things I’m having you 
do are good and benefit the people. 
9|But do your best to avoid stupid debates, 
obsessions with genealogies, and conflicts and fights over law (i.e., from a conceptual 
perspective, over a codified list of God’s commandments, in particular the Law of 
Moses), for they are useless and pointless. 
10|Shun a heretic (i.e., a person who 
breaks people off from the accepted doctrine or school of thought and forms a sect out 
of them) after giving him two clear warnings[b], 
11|knowing from firsthand 
experience that that kind of person is twisted, has no morals[c], and is sinning, being 
condemned for what’s going on inside of himself[d].
          
12|When I do send Artemis to you or maybe Tychicus, as fast as you can 
come visit me in Nicopolis, since I’ve decided to spend the winter there. 
13|Send 
Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey as soon as you can, and check with them 
first so that they don’t leave without taking something they need.
          
14|But let our own people also learn to emphasize good works that have the 
goal of meeting the needs of others, so that they’re not unproductive with their time and 
resources.
          
*[a]You can count on this statement being true…Lit: The word is faithful

considered true or morally proper.”

The Epistle of Philemon
       When Paul sat down to write this letter to Philemon, he was not conscious of the fact that he 
was adding another book to the Bible; he simply sat down to write a letter—a spontaneous one, not a 
thought-out treatise like some of his other letters—on behalf of a runaway slave of Philemon’s named 
Onesimus, whom Paul wants the help of in his ministry. Though unintentional, this letter captures the 
message of the Gospel in a true story.
       If one views the Bible from a literary perspective, this short story is one of the best fragments of 
literature found in the Bible, one that should be read and enjoyed like any other great work of literature.
       This story flows fluidly from Greek into English, guided by the feelings it carries.

15|Everyone with me sends their greetings. Greet those who love us in faith.
      The grace of God be with you all.


&PHILEM 1
1|Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, and Comrade[a] Timothy:
      To Philemon, our dear fellow worker, 
2|to Apphia our female comrade, to 
Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house[A].
          
3|Grace be to you and peace from our Father God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
4|I’m always thanking my God as I bring you up in prayer[b], 
5|hearing about 
your love and faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and for all the saints (i.e., 
those who are believers), 
6|to the ends that the sharing and participation of your 
faith—a sharing and participation which is in operation—should manifest itself in a 
recognition and better understanding of all the good which is in you[c] with Christ as the 
goal. 
7|In fact, I got a lot of joy and encouragement out of[d] your love, because the 
saints have been refreshed deep down on the inside because of you, comrade.
          
8|With this in mind, I have the audacity[e] in Christ to order you to do your 
duty by doing what’s right— 
9|Through the love of God I appeal to you all the more in 
such a personage as an old man named Paul who is also now but a slave of Christ Jesus— 

10|I appeal to you concerning my son[f], who was born into slavery as Onesimus, 

11|who used to be of no use to you but is quite useful to me at this time, 

12|who is the same person I sent back to you (in other words[g], I’m talking about 
those things which are nearest and dearest to my heart), 
13|whom I was planning 
on retaining for myself so that he could serve me under your sponsorship[h] while I’m 
imprisoned because of the Gospel[i].
          
14|I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your act of 
goodness will not have been granted as though you had no choice[j] but because you 
authorized it. 
15|Because of this, in fact, without delay he was sent away from me 
for a short period of time so that you would send him away from you forever, 

16|sending him away as someone who’s no longer a slave but sending him away for the 
benefit of someone who is a slave, dear comrade, especially for my benefit, but how much 
more for your benefit both in the flesh (i.e., from a natural perspective) and in the Lord?
          
17|So if you’re all in with me[k], welcome him and treat him as you would me. 

18|If he did something wrong to you or owes you any money, put it on my tab. 

19|I Paul personally wrote this in my own handwriting so you’ll be assured that this 
letter is genuinely from me[B]: I’ll pay you back whatever he owes—But don’t get me going 
about how[l] you owe me your very life[m]. 
20|Yes, comrade, do me this favor[n] in 
the Lord: In Christ bring to rest what is churning deep inside my heart.
          
21|I wrote to you convinced of your obedience, having come to know 
firsthand that you will even do for me what I tell you. 
22|But at the same time, 
prepare a guest room for me; you see, I’m also hoping that I’ll be the beneficiary of your 
generosity in you allowing me to stay with you on account of your many requests to have me 
over[o].
          
23|Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, says hello, 
24|along 
with my coworkers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke.
          
*[a]comrade…Lit: brother
*[b]bring you up in prayer…Lit: make a remembrance of you at my prayers
*[c]you…Or: us. The manuscripts disagree as to which is correct.
*[d]out of…Lit: at
*[e]the audacity…Also: much confidence
*[f]son…Also: child. Has a dual meaning. First, it’s the closeness Paul had to him, as he used the same word 
with Timothy. But based on the context, it’s similar to the word boys used in John 21:5 (ref. note there).
*[g]in other words…Lit: which is to say. This phrase also appears in Matt. 26:46; Mark 7:2; Acts 1:19; Heb. 
9:11,10:20.
*[h]under your sponsorship…Lit: on your behalf
*[i]while I’m imprisoned because of the Gospel…Lit: in the bonds of the Gospel
*[j]as though you had no choice…Lit: as according to necessity
*[k]if you’re all in with me…Lit: if you have commonality with me
*[l]But don’t get me going about how…Also: not to mention that
*[m]your very life…Lit: yourself
*[n]do me this favor…Lit: let me have the pleasure of you
*[o]requests to have me over…Or: prayers [to God]. I’m uncertain about this.

*[A]the church that meets in your house…Embedded in this quotation is the Gk. phrase kat’ oikon 
[κατ' οἶκόν, (κατ'/Strong’s 2596), (οἶκόν/Strong’s3624)], which means according to house. This same 
phrase is found in Acts 2:46, where’s it’s used to describe the disciples meeting from house to house. 
Here in v. 2 it may imply that Archipus’s church was one of many that met from house to house.
[B]so you’ll be assured that this letter is genuinely from me…Ref. Gal. 6:11. Paul might’ve signed the letter 
in his own handwriting so it would hold up in court—for the same reason someone signs a check 
nowadays.


Hebrews
       The Book of Hebrews is a treatise. The subject matter is the comparison between the Old and 
New Testaments, proving that the new covenant is better than the old covenant. Though veering off 
into many subjects, it returns to its principal subject.
       Because of the intensity, a translator must concentrate intensely while translating, juggling both 
the translation and following the thread of reasoning. Interpolations must be supplied at critical 
junctures, otherwise the meaning risks being lost.
       Speculations will forever abound as to who wrote this book, and the only evidence we can use 
to support any theory is from an analysis of the text itself and a comparison to the other writings of the 
New Testament. One piece of such evidence is that whoever wrote Hebrews had a mastery of Greek, it 
being probable that it was his native tongue. Also, he had studied the Septuagint extensively. Although 
his peculiar writing style isn’t immediately recognizable as what we find in Paul’s epistles, one should 
keep in mind that Hebrews is not a letter but an essay, and that the same writer will use one style when 
writing a letter and another when writing an essay. Furthermore, the author says in 13:23 that he’ll take 
Timothy with him when he travels: that sounds like Paul.
       On the other hand, a simple word such as whence [hothen, (ὅθεν/Strong’s 3606)] is found in 
Hebrews in 2:17, 3:1, 7:25, 8:3, 9:18, 11:19, but is nowhere to be found in any of Paul’s writing. One 
would a simple word like that to be independent of whether what’s being written is an essay or an 
epistle.
       Studying the entire book, we come to the conclusion that the writer was influenced by Paul’s 
teachings. As the last part of the last chapter talks about Timothy, he had to be a close associate of 
Paul’s, at the bare minimum; but whether it was actually Paul who wrote it, we’ll never know.

25|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all’s spirit.


&HEB 1
1|It was one piece at a time[a] and it was in many ways[b] that God spoke long ago 
to the Ancestors[c] by means of the prophets, 
2|but during this time—a time in which 
we see His long-awaited promises coming to pass[d]—He spoke to us in a[A] son whom 
He positioned to be the heir of everything, through whom He also made the ages (i.e., 
the epochs of time; the periods of history); 
3|and who is the brightness and radiance 
which is emitted and beams forth from His glory and is a carbon-copy[e] of His being, 
His undergirding reality[f], and who carries any and every thing on his shoulders by the 
word of God spoken into action and having His power as its instrument[B]. After he 
performed an act of cleansing for the sins of mankind, he sat at the right hand (i.e., he 
assumed the position of chief executive officer) of the Majesty in the Highest[g], 

4|having become so much better than the angels because he has inherited a name (i.e., 
a title; a position of authority; a statement of who he is; a reputation) which makes him 
more excellent, more distinguished than they. 
5|Furthermore, to which of the angels 
did He say:

You are my son,
Today I have begotten you

Plus another verse,

I will be a Father to him,
And he will be a son to Me


6|Take this for instance: when He does in fact bring the firstborn, the rightful heir, 
into the civilized world again, He says:

Have all the angels[h] worship him


7|Contrast that to this: He says this directing it to the angels,

The One Who makes His angels spirits,
And makes those who serve Him
As attendants in the ritual of His worship
A flame of fire


8|And contrast that to this: in regard to the son He says,

Your throne, God, will persist out to forever and ever,
And the scepter of straightness

(i.e., decrees and edicts which are based on
moral integrity, righteousness,
and an absence of guile, duplicity, or corruption)

Is the scepter of your kingdom

(i.e., is the way in which you run your kingdom).


9|You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness
(i.e., You hated those who refuse to be restrained
By the laws of God and of man).
Because of this God—your God—anointed[i] you
(i.e., singled you out and specially chose you)

With an anointing oil derived from exhilaration,
Which picks you out from among your peers
And elevates you from them.


10|And not only that passage, but this one too:

In reference to the beginning,
You, Lord, laid the foundation of the Earth,
And the sky, the atmosphere, and outer space[j]
Are Your handiwork.

11|These very things will be destroyed;
You, though, will still be there.
Everything will grow old and eventually wear out
Like shirts, pants, and capes do.

12|Like You would do to a cape
When it’s too old to be worn anymore,
You will roll them up or fold them,
Put them away,
And exchange them for new ones.
But You are always the same,
And Your years of continuous existence
Won’t come to an end.


13|To which of the angels did He direct this verse which He has spoken in the past:

Assume the position as My chief executive[k]
Until such a time that your enemies
Are completely squashed and enslaved[l]


*[a]one piece at a time…Also: bit by bit; gradually
*[b]one piece at a time and it was in many ways…Lit: many-parts and many-ways…Gk: polumerōs kai 
polutropōs [Πολυμερῶς καὶ πολυτρόπως, (Πολυμερῶς/Strong’s 4181), (πολυτρόπως/Strong’s4187)]. An 
alliteration, pun, assonance, or rhyme; these words may have formed a common expression.
*[c]Ancestors…Lit: fathers
*[d]but during this time—a time in which we see His long-awaited promises coming to pass…Lit: at these 
last days. Ref. note of John 6:39.
*[e]carbon-copy…Lit: the reverse pattern left on an object after being stamped by a stamp with an intricate 
pattern; the exact replica
*[f]undergirding reality…Also: substance; foundation; supporting structure…Lit: what-stands-under; 
anything set under
*[g]Highest…Lit: in high. Meaning is superlative, although the form is not.
*[h]angels…Lit: angels of God. When rendered, the qualifying words of God aren’t needed. Ref. note of 
Col. 2:18.
*[i]anointed…Ref. note of 1 John 2:20
*[j]the sky, the atmosphere, and outer space…Lit: the heavens. Ref. note of 2 Cor. 12:2.
*[k]Assume the position as my My chief executive…Lit: Sit out of [at] my right hand
*[l]completely squashed and enslaved…Lit: a footstool of your feet. A common idiom.

*[A]a son…Or: the son…Lit: son. Whether we render this a son or the son, in either choice the article is an 
interpolation. There are many instances in the NT where the definite article the is assumed after a 
preposition, and this may well be but another instance. However, there are instances also where the 
definite article is added, added apparently to prevent ambiguity. On the other hand, the omission of the 
definite article may be just that: the equivalent of (Gk. has none) an indefinite article (or perhaps none 
at all) is what was intended and what’s being conveyed; the definite was not intended. Though I’m not 
insisting that this is correct, I do favor the latter, the deciding factor being the context as usual.
*[B]the word of God spoken into action and having His power as its instrument…Lit: the word of his power. 
The Gk. for word here is rhema (ῥῆμα/Strong’s 4487)not logos (λόγος/Strong’s 3056). Also, with respect 
to of his power, in Bullinger’s Figures of Speech Used in the Bible, Appendix B, since this phrase uses the 
genitive case, “This is hardly his powerful word; but the word which is the instrument, by which His 
power is carried out.”
[C]who are about to be receiving the relief which is rightfully theirs…Lit: those who are about to be 
inheriting salvation…Or: those who are destined to be inheriting salvation…Or: those who are going to be 
receiving salvation…Some notes on the GT. The Gk. verb mellō (μέλλω/Strong’s 3195)can mean about to 
be, going to be, or perhaps destined to be. Naturally, its meaning is decided by context. Something else 
which is noteworthy is that the infinite inherit has a verb tense which insinuates ongoing action, as 
opposed to a one-time action. So the heirs are about to be inheriting, going to be inheriting, or destined 
to be inheriting salvation on an ongoing basis. This begs the question, what does salvation mean in this 
context? Many Christians, scholars, and translators assume it means “receiving Christ in the new birth” 
or something similar. When applying this definition to this verse, the dilemma is that the angels are sent 
to assist only those who are about to or are going to inherit salvation, not those who already have 
inherited it, as the word mellō refers to something which is going to happen in the future but hasn’t 
happened yet. For this reason, in this verse the word salvation does not mean receiving Christ in the 
new birth, but it means being rescued from catastrophe. This is its core meaning anyways, so the only 
surprise should be that Christian scholars failed to apply it properly in the first place. The last piece to 
the puzzle is the meaning of inherit. The Gk. and English meanings are essentially the same: it means 
coming and actually possessing what’s been set aside as yours, what’s rightfully yours. Inheriting 
salvation here is not being born-again some time in the future, but it means coming into the relief in a 
dire situation of that which is rightfully yours, a person who is already a Christ-follower. Angels are sent 
to assist Christ-followers with coming into the relief which is rightfully theirs, and to come into this relief 
on an ongoing basis.

and who are being dispatched for the purpose of being an assistant to those who are 
about to be receiving the relief which is rightfully theirs[C]?


&HEB 2
1|Because of this confusion between angels and the Son of God, it’s even more 
necessary for us to pay attention to, follow, concern ourselves with, and devote 
ourselves to what we heard, lest those things slip through the cracks[a]. 
2|The fact is, if 
the word of God spoken to the human race by angels was enforced[b], and every infraction, 
violation[c], and act of willful disobedience got a just punishment as a payback, 
3|how 
will we evade a just punishment after neglecting so great a salvation (i.e., an entire 
program of keeping all dimensions of calamity and disaster away from us) as the 
salvation we have in Christ? A salvation which was accepted and wholeheartedly 
embraced way back then by those who listened to it as it was being spoken by the Lord 
resulting in us making it effective and enforcing it[d], 
4|a message which was 
accompanied by a conformational-attestation to its truthfulness consisting of signs (i.e., 
miracles whose purpose is to confirm that the one performing them is authentic) and 
not just by signs but by wonders (i.e., awe-inspiring miracles), by a variety of miracles, 
and by bits and pieces of supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit which were done 
according to His will.
          
5|But returning to this topic about angels we’ve been talking about here: the fact 
of the matter is that He didn’t subordinate to angels the civilized world which was to 
come, 
6|but somebody somewhere solemnly delivered a truthful statement to the 
contrary saying,

What is man, that You would remember him,
(i.e., give a hoot about him)
Or the son of man[A]
(i.e., the ultimate human being)
That You would visit him?
(i.e., check on him with a purpose in mind)

7|You demoted him to a position
Which is somewhat lower than the angels;
You crowned him in glory and honor;

8|You subordinated all things to him,
Putting them under his feet[e]
(i.e., completely squashed and enslaved
everything to him).

In this regard, in the process of subordinating all things to him, nothing evaded[f] him 
and consequently has not been subordinated to him. But at the present time we do not yet 
see that all things have been subordinated to him. 
9|But we see him who’s been 
“demoted somewhat lower than the angels” (we’re referring to Jesus here) because of the 
suffering of death “crowned in glory and honor,” so that by the grace of God he would 
taste death for everyone.
          
10|You see, it was appropriate for Him—Whom all things are because of and 
Whom all things are by—after leading many sons to glory, to complete what was 
demanded of the originator of their salvation by various sufferings. 
11|And, you see, 
the one who’s making others holy and those who are being made holy both come out of 
one God; for this reason he’s not ashamed to call those being made holy “brothers” (i.e., 
comrades), 
12|saying,

I’ll spread the word about Your excellent title[g]
To my brothers.
I will sing praises to you
In the midst of the congregation.

I will reach the point
Where I have complete confidence in him

Plus another verse,

Take a look:
The children that God gave me and I are together

          
14|So since the children have flesh and blood[h] in common and share in it, 
just the same he also partook of the same[i] flesh and blood so that by the death on the cross 
he would render him who has the power of death (the devil, that is) powerless 

15|and would set them free, namely every and anybody who was subject to slavery 
throughout his entire life by the fear of death.
          
16|Furthermore, angels of course didn’t take it upon themselves to die on the 
cross, but instead the seed (i.e., the direct-descendant) of Abraham took it upon himself. 

17|The reason he had to be made into a person who’s just like all of his brothers is 
so that he would become a merciful, faithful, and reliable high priest in things that are 
relevant to or which involve God, leading to atoning[j] for the sins of the folk-people. 

*[a]slip through the cracks…Lit: drift away

[A]the son of man…Ref. Matt. 8:20 for note on son of man. The sentence, “What is man that you would 
remember him, or the son of man that you would visit him?” is a figure of speech called an epexegesis. 
In this figure of speech, a fact is stated then is restated with more detail added in the restatement. The 
initial statement is incomplete; the restatement completes it. Therefore, the one spoken of in this 
passage is the “son of man,” not mankind in general. Some have taken this passage (and also Psalm 8, 
where it’s quoted from) and have taught that mankind in Christ has been crowned with glory and honor 
and has had all things subordinated to him. That’s not the case; this passage is talking about the son of 
man, which in this passage specifically refers to Jesus. Verse 9 makes this even more clear by saying that 
it was Jesus who was “demoted somewhat lower than the angels” and was “crowned in glory and 
honor.”

18|In this regard, by the thing in which he has suffered, being subjected to a trial 
consisting of a test he had to pass, he is able to come to the rescue of those who, on an 
ongoing basis, are subjected to trials, tests, and temptations.


&HEB 3
1|For this reason, brothers (i.e., fellow comrades), saints (i.e., those God has 
separated to Himself), partakers of a heaven-calling (i.e., those summoned from heaven 
to be Christians), consider for a moment[a] the apostle (i.e., the trail-blazer) and high priest 
(i.e., our primary representative to God; the one who stands between us and God) of 
our confession of faith, Jesus, 
2|being faithful to Him who appointed him as was also 
Moses faithful as one chosen from among[b] his entire house (i.e., all his kinsmen). 

3|Furthermore, this fellow Jesus is worthy of even more glory (i.e., praise, esteem, 
honor, and adulation) than Moses consistent with how much more value and honor the 
one who built, landscaped, and furnished a house has than the house itself. 
4|You see, 
every house has a person who builds, landscapes, and furnishes it, but God is the 
builder, landscaper, and furnisher of everything. 
5|And while, yes, Moses, was 
faithful to his entire house as a servant (more specifically, an earthly servant who 
waited for God to speak then obeyed)[A] resulting in his service being an attestation to the 
truthfulness of the things which will be spoken of, 
6|but Christ was faithful as a son 
over his house, a house we are a part of, should we adhere to hope’s confidence and to 
its boasting (i.e., what we beam with pride over when we talk).
          
7|In light of this, it’s just like the Holy Spirit says in the Old Testament,

If you happen to hear His voice today,

8|Don’t harden your hearts like they did in the
Went-Over-the-Edge-and-Rebelled episode,
Like when they were hardened according to the time[c]
When they put Me through a test
In the wilderness of Sinai,

9|A test in which your predecessors[d]
Put Me through to see if I would pass.
And they saw the things I did 
10|Over a forty year period.
In light of this, I was provoked to anger
By that generation and said,
“They always wander off the true path
By what is in their heart;
They did not know, recognize or understand My ways.”

11|As I swore I would do in My outburst of wrath:
“There’s not a chance that they’ll enter My rest”.

          
12|Be on the lookout, comrades, lest there be an evil, unbelieving (i.e., 
stubbornly refusing to believe) heart in any of you which revolts against and departs 
from[e] the Living God, 
13|no—instead stave off such apostasy, encourage yourselves 
day in, day out, as long as the word “today” (which I used in the previous quotation) still 
applies, so that none of you would be hardened by the tendency of sin to cause a person 
to become delusional[f]. 
14|The fact of the matter is that we have become partakers 
of Christ if we happen to firmly adhere from beginning to end to that which is of the 
undergirding reality 
15|by what we’re being told:

If you happen to hear His voice today,
Don’t harden your hearts like they did in the
Went-Over-the-Edge-and-Rebelled episode


16|In this regard, which of the people who heard this went over the edge and 
rebelled?—It wasn’t everyone who left Egypt via Moses, was it? 
17|Whom was He 
angry with for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, who dropped dead in the 
wilderness and whose corpses were left lying there? 
18|Whom did He swear wouldn’t 
“enter into His rest”?—It was none other than the disobedient.

[A]servant (more specifically, an earthly servant who waited for God to speak then obeyed)…Lit:

needs of another by waiting on them. It applies to either a bedside nurse who attends to a sick person 
(hence its connection with healing) or serving somebody in a general sense where the servant waits for 
the person to say something then obeys it. This latter meaning is the case. In fact, therapōn is the word 
used in the phrase “Moses My servant” which appears in the LXX in Exod. 4:10; 14:31; Num. 12:7. As the 
writer of Hebrews is mimicking the exact word that the LXX uses to refer to Moses as God’s servant, it 
indicates that whoever wrote Hebrews had read the LXX extensively.

&HEB 4
1|So let us fear lest any one of you seem to come up short while there lingers a 
promise to enter His rest. 
2|You see, we too were given a good news message (the 
Gospel) just as those people were, but no—the verbally-given message[a] from God did 
not benefit those people, not having been blended with faith by those who heard it. 

3|The fact of the matter is that those who believed the message enter into the rest that 
we’re discussing here indicated by what He has stated:

As I swore I would do in My outburst of wrath: 
“There’s not a chance that they’ll enter My rest.”

…Referring to another rest even though the result of the things which were done during 
creation has been in existence since the world was initially created[b]. 
4|To elaborate on 
this point, somewhere in the Old Testament (in a place we’re all too familiar with) He made 
a statement about Saturday[c] that goes like this:

And God rested on the seventh day from all of His works


5|Plus what’s in this verse:

There’s not a chance that they’ll enter My rest


6|So since what’s left over after all of this (and has yet to be dealt with) is for some people 
to enter His rest, and since the previous group of people who were told about the good 
things God intended for them didn’t enter any rest because of disobedience, 
7|this topic is 
addressed again in the Old Testament: After this huge gap in time, a specific day referred to 
as “today” is defined by David according to the way it’s spoken of in Psalms:

If you happen to hear His voice today,
Don’t harden your hearts


8|You see, if Joshua gave them a rest of any sort, he wouldn’t have been talking about 
another time after this period of time. 
9|Therefore, what’s left on the table[d] is a Sabbath 
observance[A] for God’s people. 
10|The fact is, he who entered into[e] (i.e., joined in 
body, mind, and spirit) His rest is also the same person who rested from his works just 
as God rested from His own work of creation. 
11|So let’s be eager and in a hurry to 
enter into that rest, so that no one will fail by the same pattern of disobedience.
          
12|You see, the word of God is living, active and effective, and sharper[B] 
than any double-edged sword and is able to penetrate to the extent of separating soul 
(i.e., the mind, will, and emotions) and spirit into different parts, and of separating joint 
and marrow, and is able to judge, deciding between right and wrong, the thoughts, 
reflections, and thinking processes of a heart. 
13|There’s no kind of person, no 
person anywhere[f], who’s invisible or undetectable when subjected to His intense 
gaze[g], but everyone is stripped naked and cracked wide open under His scrutiny[h], 
with which this same statement applies to us[i].
          
14|So having a great high priest who has traversed the sky and outer space 
and reached heaven[j], Jesus the son of God, let us adhere to the articles of the confession. 

15|You see, we don’t have a high priest who’s unable to sympathize with our 
weaknesses, but one who has been tested, tempted, and pushed to the breaking point in 
every category[k] and in identical ways apart from sin. 
*[a]the verbally-given message…Lit: the word of the voice
*[b]the world was initially created…Lit: foundation of the world. A biblical expression; ref. note of 1 Pet.

*[d]what’s left on the table…Lit: there is left behind

note of 2 Cor. 12:2.
*[k]in every category…Lit: according to all

*[A]a Sabbath observance…The Gk. noun sabbatismos (σαββατισμός/Strong’s 4520), which comes from 
the verb sabbatidzō (αββατιζω/no Strong’s number), which means to keep the Sabbath. The noun-
converting suffix mos at the end of sabbatismos in conjunction with the lack (and the lack is prominent) 
of the definite article implies that sabbatismos is a type of Sabbath keeping. Sabbatismos is only found 
this one time in the NT. Had the writer of Hebrews intended to mean Sabbath explicitly, he would’ve 
used the word sabbaton (σάββατον/Strong’s 4521), which is common, and would’ve included the 
definite article.
This Sabbath observance that’s the subject of discourse in this chapter and the previous is not the same 
as the Sabbath which God instituted in Genesis. That’s the point which is made in vv. 8–10. The “rest” 
spoken of here is a rest where one ceases to work (v. 10) but receives the promises of God.
[B]sharper…Roman soldiers kept their swords razor sharp and in combat used their short, nimble swords 
to slice their opponents in the small gaps in their armor where unprotected flesh was exposed, causing 
wounds with little exertion of force. This is what this verse refers to.

&HEB 5
1|The fact of the matter is that every high priest drawn from the pool of human 
beings for the benefit of mankind is appointed to a position in regard to those things 
pertaining to God in order to offer offerings, plus sacrifices on top of that, on behalf of 
sinners, 
2|being able to moderate his feelings, restrain himself, and be gentle to the 
ignorant, to those who lack understanding, to those who are mistaken, and to those 
who’ve gone astray, since he too is engulfed in human frailty[a], 
3|and because of this 
same frailty, just like what affects the folk-people, he’s obliged just the same to offer up 
offerings over and over again in matters where his own sins are involved.
          
4|Furthermore, any-old person can’t do the honor and appoint himself to the 
position of high priest, but instead the one called by God to be a high priest gets to be 
appointed just like Aaron was appointed. 
5|In the same way Christ didn’t become a high 
priest in a self-aggrandizing manner—uh-uh—his appointment was in line with what was 
spoken to him:

You are My son
Today I have begotten you


6|This is also consistent with what a different verse says:

You are a priest and will be one forevermore
According to the order of Melchizedek


7|Who, during the time when he had a human body[b], offered up an offering of prayers 
plus humble, earnest, urgent requests for protection[A] on top of that to the One having 
the power to continually rescue and protect him from death, praying with loud[c] crying 
and tears, and he was listened to and heeded because of the reverent awe he had in the 
presence of God. 
8|Although he was a son, he learned the obedience required of him 
from the things he suffered, 
9|and once the items of obedience that were required of him 
were finished, he became a source of eternal salvation[d], 
10|designated by God to 
be a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
          
11|There’s a lot we were wanting to go over with you on this topic, and it’s 
difficult to explain anything to you since you’ve gotten to where you don’t listen very 
well. 
12|In fact, you should be teachers by this time, but instead you need to have 
someone come and teach you the fundamentals[e][B] of the word[f] of God all over again, 
and have gotten to where you require milk and can’t handle solid food. 
13|You see, 
anyone who’s on a milk-only diet has not demonstrated competency[g] in those things 
which have their origin in the subject of righteousness: he’s an infant, you see. 

*[a]human frailty…Lit: weakness
*[b]during the time when he had a human body…Lit: in the days of his flesh
*[c]loud…Also: strong
*[d]a source of eternal salvation…This does not mean that he was one of many sources of eternal salvation
*[e]fundamentals…Lit: elementary principles
*[f]word…Lit: words
*[g]has not demonstrated competency…Lit: untested; unproven

*[A]humble, earnest, urgent requests for protection…The only occurrence of the Gk. word hiketāria 
(ἱκετηρία/Strong’s 2428)in the NT. Hiketāria, and the words it’s surrounded by here appear in a phrase 
from Job 40:22 in the LXX. As the writer of Hebrews was quite familiar with the LXX (ref. note of 3:5), he 
must have borrowed the phrase from there. Hiketāria refers to “the olive branch which a supplicant held 
in his hand” (Liddell & Scott). Also see Gen. 8:11. Meyer in his commentary says that hiketāria “denotes 
the olive branch which the supplicant pleading for protection bore in his hand…It implies thus the 
prostate or urgent entreaty of one seeking refuge.”
*[B]teach you the fundamentals…There’s an odd word [Gk. tina, a form of tis, (τίς/Strong’s 5100)] tossed in 
here which is dropped from most translations because it’s difficult to make sense of. Adding tina back in, 
the new rendering would be something like: “teach you some things which are the fundamentals” or 
“teach you some fundamentals.”
[C]have developed and trained their faculties of perception to distinguish both good and bad…The 
faculties of perception is the Gk. word aisthātārion (αἰσθητήριον/Strong’s 145), which means the 
perception formed from external stimuli. In this context, it refers to the capacity to understand, to gain 
insight, and to exercise discernment based on information which one obtains through all sources that a 
person obtains information from. This is additionally confirmed by the choice of the Gk. word used for 
good in this verse [kalos, (καλῶς /Strong’s 2773)], as this word refers to goodness perceived from the 
outside, as opposed to goodness which exists on the inside of someone. The goodness is perceived from 
the outside through the faculties of perception spoken of here. But in practical terms, what the writer of 
Hebrews is referring to is a person who through practice and experience is able to observe a given 
situation and through little pieces of information gleaned here and there is able to see the good and the 
evil in that situation, and distinguish between the two. One example is this: years ago my brother-in-law 
used to top by my mother-in-law’s apartment briefly, bring friends occasionally, and after listening to 
these guys talk casually a bit could tell if they were no good or not. She was always right. Another 
example: I’m thinking of a well-known evangelist who had a huge ministry who died a few years ago. 
Just about everyone in the city in which he lived either praised him as a great saint who could do no 
wrong or condemned him as a horrible sinner who could do no right. The truth is that he was a mixture 
of both good and bad, but hardly anyone in the city would say that that was the case. The problem, you 
see, is that they couldn’t distinguish good from bad.

1|In light of this, putting aside the subject material of the fundamental doctrines 
of Christ, let us forge ahead[a], not again laying a foundation comprised of repentance 
(i.e., a change in practice in moving away from one thing to another) from dead works 
and[A] of faith in God; 
2|the doctrine of baptisms[B], the doctrine of the laying on of 
hands, and the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead (i.e., life after death) and eternal 
judgment[C]. 
3|We will do this if indeed we secure God’s permission.
          
4|But the fact is, those who were enlightened at one time and tasted (i.e., 
experienced) of the Heaven-Gift and became partakers of the Holy Spirit[b] 
5|and 
tasted that the word of God[c] in action is splendid and tasted of the powers of the 
coming age, 
6|and then fall to the side (i.e., fail to follow through with the 
commitment) are unable to engage again in the process of renewing themselves with the 
goal of repentance in mind[D], deciding, as far as their own lives are concerned, to have 
absolutely nothing to do with[d] the son of God and to expose him to public ridicule. 

7|You see, a piece of soil which drinks the rain which frequently comes down on it and 
generates[e] food useful to those who farm it receives for itself blessing and praise from 
God; 
8|but a piece of soil that bears thorns and thistles gets rejected and a curse looms 
over it[f], a piece of soil that what eventually ends up happening to it is that everything on 
it is burned to the ground.
          
9|But in your case, beloved, we’re convinced you’ll produce things which are 
better and are in sync[g] with salvation, in spite of us talking like this. 
10|The fact is 
that God is not unfair in that He’ll not overlook your accomplishments and the love you 
demonstrated, a love directed towards who He is[h], in your having served the saints (i.e., 
the people of God) and in your serving them at this time. 
11|We strongly desire that 
each of you demonstrate the same eagerness and intensity towards the certitude of hope 
until the ends are obtained 
12|so that you won’t become lazy, but will become 
imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
          
13|You see, God made a promise to Abraham, and since He didn’t have 
anyone better to swear by swore by Himself 
14|saying,

I’m absolutely going to bless your socks off
And grow your numbers in spades[i]


15|The way he obtained what was promised to him is that he patiently and 
persistently endured. 
16|Along these lines, people swear by someone who’s great, 
and the oath put forth for the purpose of confirming that what was promised will be done 
puts an end to any disagreement that might’ve existed between the parties involved. 

17|In this regard God, wanting all the more to demonstrate to the recipients of the 
promise the immutability and resoluteness of His will, intervened with an oath, 

18|so that through two immutable matters of business (namely a promise and an 
oath), in both of which it is impossible for God to lie, we would have tremendous 
encouragement, we who have run for cover by taking hold of the hope set before us, 

19|a hope which is like an anchor to the soul, both secure and firm, and which 
enters the inside room, the one behind the curtain[j] (i.e., enters into the most secret and 
holiest room in the temple, the Holy of Holies), 
*[a]forge ahead…Also: carry on…Lit: carry
*[b]Holy Spirit…This may be a synecdoche for the baptism in the Holy Spirit
*[c]word of God…The Gk. word rhema (ῥῆμα/Strong’s 4487) is used in place of the normally used logos 
(λόγος/Strong’s 3056). Rhema insinuates a spoken word, which insinuates the usage of it.
*[d]deciding, as far as their own lives are concerned, to have absolutely nothing to do with…Lit: crucifying 
to themselves the son of God. This is a NT idiom; it is also used in Gal. 6:14.
*[e]generates…Lit: gives birth to
*[f]looms over it…Lit: [is] near
*[g]in sync…Lit: in keeping
*[h]who He is…Lit: his name
*[i]to bless your socks off and grow your numbers in spades…Lit: blessing I will bless you and multiplying I 
will multiply you. Saying blessing bless and multiplying multiply is a figure of speech.
*[j]enters the inside room, the one behind the curtain…Lit: enters the inside of the curtain
*[k]trailblazer…Also: forerunner

*[A]and…The Gk. words kai (καί/Strong’s 2532)and te (τέ/Strong’s 5037), which are the two primary words 
for and, are interspersed in vv. 1–3 in such a way that repentance from dead works and faith in God are 
coupled together, and the resurrection from the dead and eternal judgment are coupled together. Also, 
the usage insinuates that not only is baptism a doctrine, but so is the laying on of hands and the 
resurrection of the dead coupled with eternal judgment.
*[B]baptisms…The Gk. word baptismos (βαπτισμός/Strong’s 909), derived from the verb baptizō 
(βαπτίζω/Strong’s 907). The connection to the word baptism is obvious; nearly every (perhaps every) 
rendering of baptism in English comes from these words. Some translations like the NASB render this 
“instructions about washings,” which is incorrect. First, the words “instructions about” are an 
interpolation (that is to say, they don’t exist in the GT and were added to make sense of the text). 
Second, “instructions about washings” are covered in “repentance from dead works”; no need to cover 
it again. Third, the context decides any ambiguity. This word baptismos appears four times in the NT, 
here and in 2 Cor. 2:12; Mark 7:4; Heb. 9:10. The times in which it means a dipping in water or 
ceremonial washings are obvious by the context. As this passage is about “fundamental doctrines,” is 
not baptism a fundamental doctrine? Have their not been entire denominational splits over this issue? Is 
it not a pillar of the Christian faith? Fourth, although baptismos as used in the NT is context-variable, the 
verb baptizō is mostly used to refer to baptism. Fifth, those who render baptismos as “instructions 
about washings” do so primarily to avoid the obvious fact that this word is plural (baptisms) not singular 
(baptism). They do so because they believe there is only one type of baptism relevant to the church 
today, namely water baptism, and if they were to render this word literally as what it obviously is—
baptisms—they would they would be forced to acknowledge that there is a second baptism, the baptism 
in the Holy Spirit, and that this baptism wasn’t just for the early church but is for believers today.
*[C]eternal judgment…The “fundamental doctrines of Christ” should be understood as the essential 
doctrines of Christianity. A brief description: “repentance from dead works” is the abandonment of the 
notion that obeying the Law of Moses or any other list of rules is your ticket to obtaining righteousness. 
This is coupled with “faith in God”: that we obtain righteousness by faith. As these are the crux of Paul’s 
message, the writer of Hebrews was at a minimum a disciple of Paul. Next are the “doctrines”: baptisms, 
laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead coupled with eternal judgment. The doctrine of 
baptisms is that a person who accepts Christ as Savior should be immediately baptized in water without 
delay. Also, there is a second baptism which occurs after accepting Christ, that is the baptism in the Holy 
Spirit. It is accompanied by speaking in tongues. The doctrine of the laying on of hands institutes a holy 
ordinance for the church to practice in the form of one or several believers placing their hands on 
another believer while at the same time praying. This was done in the Bible for praying for the sick, for 
the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and for ordination into the ministry. The next doctrine is the resurrection 
of the dead, which in the NT refers to life after death. The doctrine asserts that we don’t cease to exist 
when we die, but that we live on eternally in another life, in another body, be it eternal bliss or eternal 
damnation. The final doctrine, one which connect s to the previous, is eternal judgment: that when our 
lives are over, we will stand before God in judgment, the outcome for which will be rewards and 
punishments.
[D]unable to engage again in the process of renewing themselves with the goal of repentance in 
mind…The verb tense in the infinitive renew speaks of the process of renewing and not of a renewal as a 
whole. This person has reached the point where he’s lost the capability of changing. His will is altered to 
where he will not change again. It’s not that God cannot forgive him, it’s that he will never, ever change. 
The once-saved-always-saved teaching should be reconsidered in light of this passage.

Hebrews
20|where a trailblazer[k] entered on 
our behalf—Jesus—now that he forever became a high priest in the priestly order of 
Melchizedek.


&HEB 7
1|You see, this Melchizedek, king of Jerusalem[a], priest of God the Highest, 
who met with Abraham when he was returning from the Battle of Siddim[b] and blessed 
him, 
2|to whom Abraham gave ten percent of everything he owned, whose name is 
first and foremost translated “King of Righteousness” then subsequent to that “King of 
Salem” (that is King of Peace), 
3|who’s described in the Bible as being fatherless, 
motherless, having no genealogy, having no period of time which was early-on for him 
nor an end-of-life period but made to resemble the son of God, remains a priest into 
perpetuity.
          
4|Observe how great this fellow is whom the patriarch Abraham gave ten 
percent of the spoils from that battle to. 
5|Those who are included in the family tree of the 
sons of Levi[A], being endowed with the priesthood, indeed possess a commandment 
from the Law of Moses to receive tithes (i.e., ten percent) from the folk-people (their 
kinsmen[c] in other words), although they had yet to leave the loins of Abraham (i.e., 
they had yet to be born). 
6|But he who’s not descended from them or is included in 
their genealogy collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one in possession of the 
promises. 
7|Indisputably, the inferior person was blessed by the superior. 
8|In this 
case people who die receive tithe payments, but in that case a statement of fact is on 
record that he who receives tithe payments is alive and continues to live. 
9|A comment 
can be made along these lines that the tithe-receiving sons of Levi pay a tithe through 
Abraham. 
10|You see they were in the loins of the patriarch yet to be born when 
Melchizedek met him.
          
11|So if the Levitical priesthood really was the end-all (the folk-people, you 
see, based their system of religious regulations on it), why was there a need for another 
priest to come to prominence, one who’s described as belonging to the order of 
Melchizedek and not to Aaron’s order? 
12|The fact is, a changing of the priesthood 
necessitates a change in law (i.e., a change to the rules which govern religious 
observance and as part of that the establishment a priesthood). 
13|You see, the 
person whom these things address belongs to another tribe, a tribe for which there is no 
mention of attending to the altar (i.e., of any priestly duties). 
14|In this regard, it’s 
clear that our Lord broke through like the sun peering over the horizon in the morning 
in the tribe of Judah, a tribe for which the Law of Moses has no mention of priesthood. 

15|It’s even more clear that that there’s another priest coming to prominence, one 
who resembles Melchizedek, 
16|a priest who has not come into being according to a 
law of commandment of flesh (i.e., according to rules which require you to be of a 
certain lineage) but rather according to the power of an indestructible life. 
17|In this 
regard, this statement of truth is declared in the Old Testament:

You are a priest and will be one forevermore
According to the order of Melchizedek


18|The cancellation of a previously-instituted commandment which established a 
priesthood certainly occurs on account of said-commandment’s frailty and uselessness. 

19|You see, the Law of Moses isn’t the end-all but is a gateway to a better hope, a 
hope by which we draw near to God. 
20|To the extent that those who are designated 
by the Law to be priests are priests apart from there being any oath…
      And the fact is, those who are designated by the Law to be priests have become 
priests apart from there being an oath[B], 
21|but on the other hand, the priesthood 
which replaces it was established with an oath by means of what was spoken to him, “The 
Lord God swore an oath and won’t rescind it: ‘You are a priest and will be one 
forevermore’.”
          
22|…To that extent Jesus has become a guarantee of a better covenant. 

23|And while there have been many priests who have come and gone over the years, 
death preventing them from continuing on in their role as priest, 
24|on the other 
hand, because he’ll stay unchanged forever[d], he retains the true priesthood in 
perpetuity. 
25|As a result, he’s also able to totally, completely, and continually save 
(i.e., to protect, preserve, and prevent from harm) those who come to God through him, 
always alive and ready to intercede[e] for them.
          
26|You see, such as I described is what we have: a fitting, appropriate, 
relevant high priest, one who is holy, innocent, and unsullied, separated from the 
sinners he intercedes for and situated higher than the sky, the spiritual world, and heaven 
itself; 
27|one who doesn’t need (like the high priests need) to offer up a sacrifice 
each day for his own sins first, then and only then to offer sacrifices for the sins of the 
people, since he did this one time when he offered up himself as a sacrifice for sin and is 
done with it. 
*[a]Jerusalem…Lit: Salem. Some liberties taken. Jerusalem gets its name from Salem, which is the old city 
that Jerusalem was built over.

for intercede is the same word used in 1 Tim. 2:1; ref. note there.
*[f]message contained in the oath…Lit: the word of the oath

*[A]sons of Levi…Both Moses and his brother Aaron belonged to the tribe of Levi. When God spoke to 
Moses in the wilderness and instituted the Law of Moses, He designated the tribe of Levi and all their 
descendants to forevermore be ministers for the new religion, dispersed among the other tribes to 
assist in the religious service and regulations. The Levites didn’t work but lived off tithes. Now God 
appointed Aaron (who was of the tribe of Levi, hence himself a Levite) and his sons and their 
descendants perpetually to be the priests, and there are different terms used in this passage to refer to 
this order, some of which are synecdoches. Terms such as Levi, Aaron, the sons of Levi, and the sons of 
Aaron all mean the same thing.
[B]those who are designated by the Law to be priests have become priests apart from there being an 
oath…Apparently, every oath referred to in this chapter is an oath which promises that the priesthood 
established will last eternally, like the first oath in v. 7 (“you are a priest forevermore”).

Hebrews
28|You see, the Law put men who have a weakness (i.e., limitations; 
shortcomings) in place as high priests; but the message contained in the oath[f], a message 
which was made after the Law established its priesthood, forevermore established as high 
priest a son who has been made to be the end-all and who has been made complete ad-
infinitum.


&HEB 8
1|The crux of the argument given here is this: we have such a high priest, a 
priest who sat down at the right hand (i.e., was appointed chief executive) of the throne 
of the Majesty in heaven[a], 
2|one who’s a servant who performs the rituals that 
involve the holy things, places, and observances and the rituals of the True Tabernacle, 
a tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not a human being. 
3|You see, every high 
priest is appointed to go about offering offerings plus sacrifices on top of that; as a 
result, it’s necessary for this person to have some offering to offer. 
4|So if he were on 
the Earth, he would not be a priest of any sort, there being others whose job is to offer 
offerings according to law (i.e., in accordance with the rules that had been laid down, 
specifically rules in the Law of Moses), 
5|those in particular who serve as copies and 
representations[b] of what goes on in the spiritual world and in heaven, like in the word 
of caution Moses had been given when he was intending to erect the tabernacle in the 
wilderness of Sinai,

See to it that all things are made to reflect
The blueprint shown to you on the mountain


6|But now he’s at the point where he’s obtained a ritualistic-service which is a 
quantum leap improvement, which is in proportion to him being the mediator of a 
better covenant, one which has been enacted on the basis of better promises.
          
7|You see, if the first covenant had no defects or problems, there would be no 
basis for going about seeking a second covenant. 
8|In this regard, in pointing out 
problems He tells them,

Here now—“A time is coming,” says the Lord,
“A time in which I will cause a new covenant
To take shape and assume its final form
Where the nations[c] of Israel and Judah are concerned—

9|A covenant that isn’t modeled after 
The covenant I made with your ancestors[d]
During the time I put My hand on them
(i.e., supernaturally intervened in their lives)
In order to lead them out of Egypt.
Since they wouldn’t remain in My covenant,
I paid no more attention to them,” says the Lord.


10|”Because the very covenant I will enter into
With the nation of Israel after that period of time,”
Says the Lord,
“Is a covenant where I will go about delivering
My laws to their minds.
I will write them upon their hearts.
I will assume the role of being their God,
And they will assume the role of being my people.

11|There is no conceivable scenario where each person
Will have to teach his fellow citizen or his comrade[e]
Telling them how to know the Lord,
Since everyone will know Me directly
From those of them who are insignificant
To those who of them who are great,

12|Because I will treat their wrong-doings with mercy[f],
And I will absolutely not remember their sins anymore.”


*[a]in heaven…Lit: in the heavens
*[b]representations…Lit: shadows
*[c]nations…Lit: house
*[d]ancestors…Lit: fathers
*[e]comrade…Lit: brother
*[f]treat their wrong-doings with mercy…Lit: be merciful with their wrong-doings. A figure of speech.

*[g]nearly faded into obscurity…Lit: near disappearing

Hebrews
13|By saying the word “new” in conjunction with this other covenant, He obsoleted the 
first covenant. But whatever thing is growing old and becoming obsolete has nearly 
faded into obscurity[g].


&HEB 9
1|Now the first covenant regulated and maintained a service of religious rituals 
and the systematic order of what is deemed holy[a]. 
2|You see, the outer sanctuary[b] was 
prepared in such a way that it contained the menorah and the Table of Showbread. This 
outer sanctuary is called the Holy Place. 
3|But behind a curtain is the second sanctuary, 
which is called the Holy of Holies, 
4|having a golden incense altar and the ark of the 
covenant, the ark being completely wrapped in a gold covering. Inside the ark is a 
golden vase which contained the sample of manna saved from the time of wandering in the 
wilderness, Aaron’s rod which budded, and the stone tablets of the Ten 
Commandments[c], 
5|and situated above the ark overshadowing the mercy seat were 
cherubim of God’s glory—things we won’t go into a piece-by-piece description of at this 
time.
          
6|Now things were set up this way: throughout the year, the priests periodically 
entered the outer sanctuary in order to make sure the required rituals were done, 

7|but just one time a year the high priest entered the inner sanctuary, but not without 
taking blood with him, blood that he offered on behalf of himself and on behalf of the 
sins that the folk-people unknowingly committed. 
8|This is what the Holy Spirit is 
signifying: while the outer sanctuary still exists and is being actively used[d], the way 
into the Holy of Holies has not yet been revealed, 
9|a particular concept which is 
analogous to[e] the period of time which has arrived and is presently in operation, which 
according to this analogy means that the offering up of offerings and sacrifices is 
powerless to bring those performing the rituals to completeness along the lines of 
conscience; 
10|the regulations involved with eating, drinking, various kinds of 
ceremonial washings were physical and self-originated acts[f] only, imposed until a 
period of reform happened to arrive and change things.
          
11|Christ showed up as a high priest of the good things which came into 
being because of the greater and more perfect tabernacle, which is not hand-made (in 
other words, not of this planet[g]). 
12|It was not by the blood of goats and calves but 
by his own blood that he entered once and for all into the Holy of Holies and obtained[h] 
eternal release and deliverance from sin. 
13|You see, if the blood of bulls and goats 
and the sprinkling of the ashes of an incinerated heifer make those who’ve been defiled 
pristine and undefiled again to the producing of the purity of the flesh, 
14|how much 
more will the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without 
blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works resulting in you serving the 
Living God?
          
15|Because of this, he’s the mediator of a new covenant, so that, considering 
that a death occurred for the redemption (i.e., the settling of something; fixing what’s 
broken) of the transgressions which were committed under the first covenant, those 
who’ve been called to be God’s people would partake of the eternal inheritance (i.e., the 
things God has immutably and irrevocably reserved for them and intended for them to 
have). 
16|The fact of the matter is that where a last will and testament[A] (which is 
what a covenant is) is concerned, it’s necessary that the death of the will’s testator be 
proven legally. 
17|You see, upon the death of the testator the will is frozen as-is and 
can no longer be amended in any way; it never has that immutability-strength while the 
testator is still alive and therefore able to amend it at any time. 
18|Hence, the first 
covenant was not instituted apart from the inclusion of blood. 
19|In fact, once every 
commandment in the Law was spoken to all the people by Moses, taking the blood of 
calves and goats mixed with water, red wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled the scroll he read 
from itself and all the people 
20|while saying, “This is the blood of the covenant 
which God commanded you to keep[i]." 
21|In addition he sprinkled the tabernacle 
and all the serving vessels used in the rituals in blood the same way. 
22|It’s almost 
as though it’s an Old Testament axiom that according to the Law of Moses everything is 
purified and cleansed by blood, and apart from the shedding of blood any sort of 
forgiveness of sin doesn’t happen.
          
23|While the copies of the things in the spirit-world[j] (i.e., the copies being 
the earthly tabernacle and items in it) need to be cleansed by these things (i.e., by the 
blood of calves, of goats, etc.), but the actual things in the spirit-world that the earthly 
things are a copy of require better sacrifices than the ones offered on earth. 
24|You see, 
Christ didn’t enter a Holy of Holies that was created by human hands, these man-made 
things merely being symbolic representations and mirror-copies of the real things, but 
instead entered into the same thing (i.e., the thing which the symbolic representations 
are based on) which is in the spirit-world, to be seen by, to be known by, and to be 
subjected to God’s intense scrutiny[k] on our behalf. 
25|Nor is it the case that he 
repetitively[l] brings himself into this Holy of Holies in the spirit-world just like the high 
priest enters the earthly Holy of Holies each year with another batch of blood to be 
sprinkled. 
26|If that were the case, he would have to suffer and die on the cross many 
times starting the moment the human race began[m]; but at this this critical moment in 
the annuls of history[n], he appeared this once for the obliteration of the sin of mankind 
because of his sacrifice having been disclosed and made known to everyone. 

27|And reflective of the fact that it’s been allocated that every person in the human 
race undergo death once and only once and after this undergo judgment, 
*[a]the systematic order of what is deemed holy…Or: the worldly holy…Lit: the worldly [or systematic] 
holiness

[A]last will and testament…Lit: covenant. The word covenant appears in a few places in this chapter (most 
notably in v. 15). The covenant of v. 15 apparently is also the will of v. 16, but the context of v. 16 is such 
that it refers to a will.

Hebrews
28|in the 
same way as this, Christ, having been brought forth one time only for the purpose of 
being offered up for the sins of the many, will be seen a second time apart from sin (i.e., 
he’ll make a second appearance, and this appearance will have nothing to do with 
atoning for sins) by those who assiduously and eagerly look to him for salvation (i.e., 
look to him to protect them from potential harm, whatever that might be).


&HEB 10
1|You see, the Law, containing a shadow of the good things to come and not 
itself the form which casts the things’ shadow, by the same sacrifices that are continuously 
being offered year after year can never complete or perfect those who approach God in 
this way; 
2|otherwise, wouldn’t these sacrifices ceased to have been offered because 
those performing the rituals would have no more sins on their consciences once they 
had been cleansed? 
3|No—in doing those things year after year, there’s a reminder of 
sins that need to be cleansed. 
4|The fact of the matter is that it’s impossible for the blood 
of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
5|In this light, while entering the world Jesus 
said[a],

“Sacrifice and offering was not what You wanted;
Instead, You prepared a body for me.

6|You were not pleased
With the usual burnt offerings
And the like surrounding sin.”

7|Then I said, “Hey, I have come—
If you rummage through the right scroll[A]
You’ll find this written about me—
‘I have come to do[b] Your will, O God.’”


8|He was saying in the above quotation that “sacrifice and offering” and “the usual 
burnt offerings and the like surrounding sin” were “not what You wanted” nor were You 
“pleased” with them, the very offerings which are offered as prescribed by the Law; 

9|Then he said, “‘Hey, I have come…to do Your will.” He gets the first (i.e., the 
sacrifices, offerings, and burnt offerings) out of the way so that the second (i.e., Jesus’s 
coming to do God’s will) would stand in its place. 
10|By the will of God referred to in 
this passage, we will be sanctified (i.e., set apart from sin and made holy) through the 
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.
          
11|Day after day every priest has taken a stand performing the ritualistic 
service of worship, serving the same sacrifices which have been offered many a time, 
things in particular which can never remove sins. 
12|But after this fellow Jesus 
offered one sacrifice for sins that would last ad infinitum, he sat down at the right hand 
of God (i.e., assumed the position of God’s chief executive), 
13|from that point 
onwards waiting until such a time that his enemies be placed under his feet (i.e., that 
they be completely squashed and enslaved). 
14|You see, by the offering up of one 
offering he has perpetually completed, finished, and perfected those being sanctified.
          
15|But on this topic the Holy Spirit also gives us supporting evidence; you 
see, he has stated afterwards,


16|”This is the very covenant
Which I will make with them after that period of time,”
Says the Lord,
“Granting My laws to be upon their heart and upon their mind,
As I grant, so will I write them.

17|And as far as their sins and of their lawlessness
(i.e., things that have their origin in the refusal to
Be restrained by the rules of God and of man)
And things that have their origin in the same:
By no means will I remember them any further.”


18|Where one finds these sins removed, any offering pertaining to sin is no longer 
relevant.
          
19|So comrades[c], having boldness by the blood of Jesus to enter the Holy of 
Holies[B], 
20|an entrance which he newly made available to us, a way through the 
curtain which is brand-new and living (in other words, a way through his flesh), 

21|and having such a great priest as this over the house of God, 
22|let us 
approach the Holy of Holies with a true heart and in an assurance which is of faith, our 
hearts having been sprinkled (analogous to the mixture of blood, water, and hyssop which the 
priest sprinkled over the people) purging us from a conscience haunted by evil deeds[d] and 
our body washed (analogous to the ceremonial washings that were done under the Law) in 
clean water. 
23|Let us resolutely hold on to hope’s confession, for He Who 
promised is faithful. 
24|And let us consider, take notice of, and study one another 
for the purpose of agitating or provoking love and good works, 
25|not abandoning 
the practice of gathering ourselves at one place, like some people are in the habit of 
doing—no, we should be encouraging each other instead, even more so seeing the day of 
the Lord fast approaching.
          
26|In fact, for those of us who deliberately sin after obtaining the 
recognition of or the precise understanding of the truth, there’s no longer a sacrifice 
pertaining to sin left in place that can cleanse us of our sin, 
27|but there’s an air of a 
dreadful expectation of judgment and of a raging fire which are coming to consume 
those who set themselves in opposition. 
28|Anyone who remorselessly[e] set aside an 
individual law in the Law of Moses would be killed upon the testimony of two or three 
witnesses. 
29|How much worse of a punishment do you think the one who 
tramples under foot (i.e., completely trashes, treats with utter contempt, and completely 
disavows himself from) the son of God, and deems the blood of the covenant which we 
were sanctified with unclean (i.e., vile and dirty), and insults the Spirit of Grace will 
deserve? 
30|In this regard, we’re quite familiar with the verse which says, 
“Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” plus the verse, “The Lord will judge His people.” 

31|It’s dreadful to fall into the hands of the Living God (i.e., to reach the point 
where God will act in judgment and cause something to happen to you).
          
32|Think back over the early days, when you were first enlightened. Back 
then you endured a huge bout of sufferings. 
33|While the vilification, vituperation, 
and reviling plus persecution made you a public spectacle, you became fellow 
participants of those who are regularly made to live their lives this way. 
34|In this 
regard, you shared in the same sufferings[f] of those who are in jail[g], and you took the 
looting of your possessions with joy, knowing that you own a possession which is 
better, one that can’t be taken away from you. 
35|So don’t get rattled or lose your 
nerve[h]; there’s a huge benefit of having such confidence, 
36|seeing that you need 
endurance, so that, having done the will of God, you would get ahold of the promise for 
yourself.


37|The fact of the matter is that
In just a little, little while now
He who’s coming will come and won’t delay any further.

38|But the person I deem righteous[i]
Will live out of faith,
But if he shirks his faith[j],
My soul will take no pleasure in him.

*[h]get rattled or lose your nerve…Lit: throw away your confidence
*[i]the person I deem righteous…Lit: my righteous one
*[j]shirks his faith…Also: shrink back; avoid; draw back; disappear

*[A]rummage through the right scroll…Lit: with the knob and roller of the scroll. Without being certain 
what this means, the assumption is that this is a figure of speech similar to Gal. 3:10, but here it refers to 
the turning of the knob which advances the place in the scroll. This is indicative of the reader browsing 
through the scroll to locate a passage which is about to be read aloud.
[B]Holy of Holies…Lit: of the holies. Looking at the precise wording of the GT, the term “Holy of Holies” is 
introduced in 9:3, and the GT literally reads “holy of holies.” Thenceforth, however, the author of 
Hebrews shortens the literal phrase from holy of holies to of the holies (9:8); the holies (9:12,25); and 
simply holies (9:24). So the phrase of the holies which appears in 10:19 is yet another usage of a 
shortened form of Holy of Holies, a repetition of the wording which appeared in 9:8 when you get right 
down to it.

Hebrews
39|But you don’t have the characteristics of a shirker whose actions result in 
destruction, but rather you have the characteristics of a person of faith whose actions result in 
the acquisition and securing of the soul (i.e., the part of you that makes you unique).


&HEB 11
1|Faith is[A] the undergirding of what’s hoped for, the proof of things not seen 
(which includes all things for which there is no physical evidence); 
2|by this, you see, 
those we hold in esteem from long ago[a] had an official account, a favorable mention, of 
their actions recorded for posterity.
          
3|By faith our mind understands that the world was set in order by a sentence 
spoken by God, resulting in what we see coming into being out of what hasn’t been 
manifested.
          
4|By faith Abel offered God a much better sacrifice than Cain, through which 
an attestation to him being righteous was entered into the official record, the record 
specifying the gifts he offered to God, and through his faith, though he’s dead he’s still 
speaking.
          
5|By faith Enoch was instantaneously transported from one place to another 
for the purpose of not experiencing[b] death; “There was no trace of him to be found[c] 
because God had transported him.” You see, before he was transported, it had been 
stated for the record that he had pleased God quite well.
          
6|Now apart from faith it’s impossible to be well-pleasing to God, for he who 
approaches God must believe (and have already believed ahead of time)[d] that He is the 
Great I Am and that a reward manifests itself and is awarded to those who seek Him out.
          
7|By faith Noah, having been warned by God about things that had not yet 
been seen, in piety and in the fear of God built and provisioned an ark for the purpose 
of preserving his family and keeping it safe, through which faith he condemned the 
world (i.e., consigned the world to punishment) and became an heir of the 
righteousness which comes from faith.
          
8|By faith Abraham obeyed when he was summoned to leave the place he lived 
and go to the place which he was going to receive as an inheritance (i.e., a place which 
was reserved for him exclusively and in perpetuity), and he departed having no idea 
where he was going. 
9|By faith he emigrated and became a foreign resident in the 
land of promise, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, joint-heirs of the same promise. 

10|You see, he anticipated, expected, and was eagerly awaiting the city which is 
not a rickety-rackety, makeshift one but is built to last[e], whose builder and architect is 
God.
          
11|By faith, even Sarah, who couldn’t have children, got the ability to 
conceive in her old age, since she considered the One Who had promised to be faithful. 

12|As this was the case, one man (and this fellow was debilitated[f]) sired a nation as 
innumerable as the stars in the sky and the grains of sand on the beach.
          
13|All these people died in sync with faith, not having received the promises, 
but having seen and greeted them from afar instead, and having confessed that they 
were foreigners on this planet. 
14|The fact is, those who say such things make it 
evident that they seek their native country. 
15|If they kept on rehashing memories 
of fondness for that ungodly place they ventured forth from, they would have found[g] an 
opportunity or made an excuse to return; 
16|but as it stands, they aspire for better, 
that is to say, for something from the spiritual domain or from heaven. In light of this, 
God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
          
17|By faith Abraham, while being tested, offered up Isaac—he who gladly 
received the promises offered up his one and only son, 
18|to whom it was spoken, 
“The descendants who will perpetuate your family tree will be designated as coming 
through Isaac.[h]” 
19|Abraham figured that, in addition to the promises He already 
made, God is able to raise someone from the dead. As a result of this, he recovered Isaac 
from the dead in an analogous fashion.
          
20|Also by faith Isaac pronounced blessings over Jacob and Esau in regard 
to what would happen to them in the future.
          
21|By faith Jacob while on his death bed pronounced blessings over the sons 
of Joseph, and “bowed down in worship leaning on top of his staff[B].”
          
22|By faith Joseph, nearing the end, left a reminder about the Exodus with 
the descendants of Israel and left orders about his bones (i.e., orders that they take his 
bones with them when they leave).
          
23|By faith Moses was hidden by his parents after he was born out of a 
reverential fear because they saw that the boy had charisma[i], and they didn’t fear the 
king’s decree. 
24|By faith Moses grew up and became a great man and renounced 
his claim of being the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 
25|having chosen to endure the 
hardship with God’s folk rather than to retain the pleasures of sin for a brief span of 
time, 
26|considering the vilification and reviling of Christ to be greater riches than 
the treasures of Egypt; for he was focused on the reward.
          
27|By faith he left Egypt, unafraid of the wrath of Pharaoh the king, for he 
endured as one seeing the Unseen-One. 
28|By faith he observed the Passover and 
the marking of the blood, done so that the Destroyer wouldn’t touch any of their 
firstborn sons. 
29|By faith he crossed the Red Sea as if it was dry land; when the 
Egyptians tried to cross it, they were drowned.
          
30|By faith the walls of Jericho fell after being marched around in a circle for 
seven days.
          
31|By faith, the prostitute Rahab wasn’t wiped out with those who were 
disobedient after extending a welcome to the spies and taking them in[j].
          
32|And what more will I say? For there’s not enough time to go into detail 
about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, plus Solomon and the prophets, 

33|who through faith conquered kingdoms, put into practice standards of fairness 
while ruling, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 
34|extinguished intense 
heat-generating fires[k], escaped the sword’s edge, got their strength back from 
weakness, became mighty men in war, routed foreign armies in battle. 
35|Women 
got members of their family who died to come back to life. Others were tortured but 
refused the chance to get out of it, so that they would be better off in their life after 
death[l]. 
36|Others experienced jeering and whipping; still others experienced being 
chained up and locked up. 
37|They were stoned to death, they were sawn in two, 
they were tempted and brought to the breaking point, they were slain by the sword, 
they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, while being impoverished, afflicted, 
distressed, mistreated— 
38|people whom the world is not worthy of—They lived in 
deserts, on mountains, in caves, in underground tunnels—
          
39|Because of their faith all of these people had a favorable account of their 
exploits recorded for posterity’s sake but did not obtain the promise, 
*[a]those we hold in esteem from long ago…Lit: the elders
*[b]experiencing…Lit: seeing
*[c]There was no trace of him to be found…Lit: he was not found
*[d]believe (and have already believed ahead of time)…Lit: believe, but with a verb tense which insinuates 
a one-time believing, one that occurred in the past.
*[e]is not a rickety-rackety, makeshift one but is built to last…Lit: has foundations
*[f]debilitated …Lit: dead
*[g]found…Lit: had
*[h]The descendants who will perpetuate your family tree will be designated as coming through Isaac…Lit: 
by Isaac seed to you will be called
*[i]had charisma…Also: sophisticated; well-bred; handsome; capable. The Gk. word used here at its core 
refers to the splendor of cities in contrast to the lack of such splendor one finds in the countryside.
*[j]extending a welcome to the spies and taking them in…Lit: receiving the spies with peace. An expression; 
ref. note of Matt. 10:13.
*[k]intense heat-generating fires…Lit: the power of fire
*[l]life after death…Lit: resurrection

*[A]Faith is…Some translations render this ”now faith is,” which is also correct. However, the Gk. word for 
now is the conjunction de, one of the most common words in the NT. De does not mean “at this 
moment in time.” Some ministers, however, take the word “now” to mean “faith is now” in other words 
“faith by nature exists at this moment in time.” They then go on to explain how a principle of faith is that 
it exists in the here-and-now, not some time in the future. While this is true about faith, this is not what 
the GT of 11:1 is saying. Other translations’ use of “now” should not be taken to mean “at the present 
time.”
[B]bowed down in worship leaning on top of his staff…The GT of this is a verbatim quotation of Gen. 
47:31 in the LXX. As Jacob’s blessings of Joseph’s sons is found in Gen. 48, not 47, it’s a mystery why 
these two seemingly disjointed accounts are linked together here.

provided something better for us, so that their ranks would not be complete without us 
added.


&HEB 12
1|For this very reason, we too, surrounded by such a cluster[a] of tremendous 
witnesses, let us lay aside every burden and the sin which entangles us and run with 
endurance the up-and-coming race we’re entered in, 
2|setting our undivided 
attention on Jesus, the originator and perfector of our faith, who, instead of giving up 
because of the task he was assigned to do, endured the cross, disregarding and having 
contempt for the shame associated with it ,and has sat down at the right hand of God’s 
throne (i.e., he took up the position of God’s chief executive). 
3|Furthermore, consider 
for a moment that he has endured such extreme opposition from sinners, so that you not 
grow weary in the depths of your souls and capitulate— 
4|You have yet to resist to the 
point of bloodshed, 
5|and you’ve completely forgotten the encouragement which 
addresses you as sons:

My son, do not take lightly the discipline of the Lord
As he molds you into the person you need to be[b]
Nor capitulate when corrected by Him.

6|You see, whom the Lord loves He disciplines,
And He thrashes every son
Whom He has whole-heartedly welcomed as His own[c].


7|You endure for the purpose of being molded by discipline into the person you need to 
become[c]: God treats you like you are His son. In this regard, can you think of any son 
whom his father doesn’t discipline? 
8|But if you live in absence of[d] discipline, which 
you all get your fair share of now, then you’re children some strange woman had out of 
wedlock and not sons who are included in the family.
          
9|Furthermore, we had fathers in the natural who disciplined us time and time 
again, and we gave them our respect; how much more should we submit to the Father 
of our spirits and live this way? 
10|You see, while it’s true that for a brief period[e] 
our natural fathers disciplined us the way they personally thought discipline ought to be 
done, but He, though, disciplines us for our own benefit, for the purpose of us being able 
to partake of His holiness on an ongoing basis. 
11|While any discipline at the time 
it’s occurring is not considered to be a bundle of joy, but instead is painful, later on it 
yields a peaceful result, namely righteousness, to those who have been trained by the 
discipline they received.
          
12|In light of this, put the hands that lie idle at your side and the knees 
which have become weak back in the position where they’re poised for action, 

13|and clear out a straight path for your feet, so that the hip joint, knee joint, etc. 
which is preventing you from walking not be dislocated any more, but rather be healed.
          
14|Pursue peace with all people, and pursue holiness, without which no one 
will see the Lord. 
15|Check up on any person who might lack the grace of God (i.e., 
who needs to receive mercy, kindness, or forgiveness from God) and help them in 
whatever situation they’re in which is causing this, lest some root of bitterness grow up 
and become a source of irritation, annoyance, or trouble, and many people would be 
tainted by this root; 
16|lest there be some fornicator metaphorically speaking[B] (i.e., 
someone who’s immoral in a way which is analogous to sexually immorality) or 
someone who’s profane or has no piety like Esau, who sold what was rightfully his by 
birth for one meal. 
17|In fact, you know the story, how afterwards, while wanting to 
receive his inheritance through the blessing bestowed by Isaac, he was rejected; the simple 
fact is that there was no way he could turn the situation around[f], although with tears 
on his face he tried.
          
18|The fact of the matter is that you haven’t come to a physically tangible 
mountain like Mount Sinai, to one which is on fire, and to darkness and to gloom and to a 
whirlwind 
19|and to the sound of a trumpet and to a voice speaking words, a voice 
which those who heard it begged that not another word be spoken to them; 
20|you 
see, they couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t stand the order, “If so much as an animal 
happens to touch the mountain, it will be stoned to death.” 
21|The scene was so 
terrifying that Moses said, “I’m terrified and shaking all over”—
          
22|—No, you’ve come to Mount Zion and to the city of the Living God, the 
Jerusalem in heaven, and to a myriad of angels, 
23|to the mother of all church 
gatherings[g] of the firstborn who’s registered in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and 
to spirits of upright, decent people who’ve been made perfect, 
24|and to Jesus the 
mediator of a new covenant and to the true sprinkling-blood, which calls for[h] better 
things than the blood of Abel which cried out from the ground.
          
25|See to it that no one disregards or rejects what’s being called for. You see, 
if those people who disregarded or rejected what was called for couldn’t escape after He 
warned them when they were on the Earth, how much more will they not escape, they 
who refuse Him Who warns from heaven? 
26|That voice shook the Earth back 
then, but at the present time there’s a promise which He has given which says, “I will 
yet cause the Earth to shake one more time, and not just shake the Earth but the sky, 
outer space, and the spirit-world too.” 
27|But the phrase “yet one more time” 
insinuates the removal of those things which are shaken, as they are things which have 
been created, so that what would remain would be the things which can’t be shaken.
          
28|In light of this, as we heartily embrace a kingdom which can’t be shaken, 
let us maintain an attitude of thankfulness[i], one in which we serve God in a way that 
pleases Him, keeping it with reverence and awe: 
*[a]cluster…Lit: cloud
*[b]as he molds you into the person you need to become…Lit: for discipline. Ref. major note of v. 5.
*[c]whole-heartedly welcomed as His own…Lit: He receives
*[d]live in absence of…Lit: are without
*[e]a brief period…Lit: a few days
*[f]there was no way he could turn the situation around…Lit: he did not find a place of repentance
*[g]the mother of all church gatherings…Lit: a gathering and a church. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[h]calls for…Lit: speaks of
*[i]maintain an attitude of thankfulness…Lit: have grace [thanks]

*[A]As he molds you into the person you need to be…An interpolation based on the fact that the word 
discipline in this verse comes from a root word meaning son or child, and refers to the discipline, 
correction, and instruction that a son receives that will mature him into the man he needs to become. 
This discipline is done with this long-term goal in mind and is not a simple punishment.
[B]fornicator metaphorically speaking…Lit: fornicator. We know from the OT account of Esau and Jacob 
that Esau never committed fornication, which is any act of sexual immorality (not just sex out of 
wedlock). Therefore, the episode where he sold his birthright for a bowl of stew is a metaphor to 
fornication: it’s the same sin but minus the sexual component. Esau had convinced himself that he 
would die if he didn’t eat the meal Jacob prepared (this was not true; nobody dies for lack of a single 
meal, especially someone who can still walk). He exchanged something precious for a short-term 
gratification of the flesh.

1|Continue in your love for your fellow comrade, loving the fellowship you 
have with them. 
2|Don’t neglect to extend a hearty friendship-welcome to those who 
are new to a church, new to the area, or who are just plain different than yourselves. In 
doing this, some have unwittingly welcomed angels.
          
3|Remember those who are in prison[a] as though you’re fellow inmates, and 
remember those who are ill-treated as though you have to live in their shoes[b].
          
4|Be sure to honor the institution of marriage and be sure that what you do in bed 
is morally pure; for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
          
5|Be sure that the kind of life you live is absent the love of money; He himself 
said, “There’s no way I’ll ever leave you or forsake you.” 
6|This gives us confidence so 
much so that we perk up and have the gumption[c] to say,

The Lord is my helper; I will not fear.
What can a person do to me?

          
7|Remember your leaders, the very people who spoke the word of God to you, 
closely observe on a continual basis the end-result of their manner of life—mimic their 
faith.
          
8|Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
          
9|Don’t get sidetracked by different and novel teachings; you see, it’s good that 
the heart be established by grace, not by teachings about what food we should or shouldn’t 
eat. These teachings haven’t benefited those who have changed their lifestyles to follow 
them. 
10|We have a spiritual altar, and they who serve by performing the religious 
rituals in the physical tabernacle are not entitled to eat the food which is a byproduct of the 
sacrifices offered upon it. 
11|In fact, the carcasses of the animals whose blood is 
brought by the high priest into the Holy of Holies are incinerated outside the camp[A], 
out away from where everybody lived. 
12|In light of this, Jesus also, so that through his 
own blood he would purify, sanctify, and make the folk-people holy, suffered outside 
of the gates of the city away from where everybody lived. 
13|So then, let’s go outside 
the camp where everybody lives and go to him, pick up his vilification, vituperation, and 
reviling, and carry it ourselves.
          
14|You see, here on this planet we don’t have a city for us to live in which is 
going to last into eternity, but we’re seeking after the city to come instead. 

15|Through him let us continuously offer up to God a sacrificial offering consisting 
of praise[B], in other words, the fruit of lips which confess words in his name and to his 
name (i.e., by his authority and to his glory). 
16|And don’t neglect to do acts of 
kindness and to help others financially; for God is quite pleased with sacrificial 
offerings such as these.
          
17|Be persuaded by your leaders to the point of obeying them and submit to 
them; you see, they keep watch over your very lives[d], as they’ll be held accountable for 
them[e]. But submit so that they may do their job with joy and not regress into grumbling; 
it just isn’t worth it.
          
18|Pray for us, and keep on praying for us. We believe that we have a good 
conscience (i.e., we’re not involved in any wrongdoing; there’s nothing we feel guilty 
about) in that we are wanting to maintain a lifestyle of excellence in every respect. 

19|But more importantly, I encourage you to pray so that I’ll be restored to you (i.e., 
be reinstated and continue doing with you what I was doing) as soon as possible.
          
20|Now may the God of peace, Who brought the Great Shepherd[f] of the 
Sheep back from the dead by means of the blood of the eternal covenant—our Lord 
Jesus Christ— 
21|in every good way put you into proper order and prepare you for 
a purpose, doing this with the goal of accomplishing His will, working in us what from 
His point of view is very pleasing[g] through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever 
and ever. Let us pause for a moment to let that sink in[h].
          
22|Bear with me, comrades[i], as I encourage you with this word of 
encouragement. You see, I’ve only briefly written to you about my personal affairs. 

23|Just so you know, our fellow comrade Timothy has been let out of jail. If he can 
manage to come over to where I am in a hurry, I’ll take him with me when I visit you.
          
24|Extend my greetings to all those in leadership positions and to all the 
saints (i.e., all the other believers). Those from the Roman province of Italy greet you.
          
*[a]in prison…Lit: in bonds
*[b]as though you have to live in their shoes…Lit: yourselves also being in the body
*[c]perk up and have the gumption…Lit: to be having courage. Used this way in Mark 10:49; 15:43; ref. 
note of John 16:33.
*[d]your very lives…Lit: your souls 
*[e]they’ll be held accountable for them…Lit: they’ll have to give an account
*[f]Shepherd…Also: pastor
*[g]what from His point of view is very pleasing…Lit: well-pleasing in His sight
*[h]Let us pause for a moment to let that sink in…Lit: amen. Ref. note of Rev. 19:4.
*[i]comrades…Lit: brothers

*[A]the camp…This word and the word tabernacle used in v. 10 are both references to the tabernacle used 
by the Israelites when the wandered in the Sinai desert for forty years. Where the people lived was 
called a “camp” because they had no buildings to live in since they could be commanded by God to pick 
up and leave any day.
[B]a sacrificial offering consisting of praise…Lit: sacrifice of praise. This is a metaphor which compares 
praise offered to God to OT sacrifices offered to God and incinerated on the altar of burnt offerings. 
Some have misinterpreted this to mean that it is a personal sacrifice on our part to praise God.


James
       James addresses his epistle to Jewish believers, as he was the leader of the Jewish faction of the 
church. His wisdom is in the Semitic style that his brother Jesus used rather than the Greek style that 
Paul uses, giving it an unusual flavor which complements the other epistles.
       Church tradition holds that James prayed so much that his knees were calloused. His dedication 
to prayer comes across in the letter.
       Looking at the Greek text, James’s writing style is straightforward, shying away from some of the 
exotic verb tenses and particles one finds Luke and Paul using, but he also displays a deep vocabulary, 
using words which are not found anywhere else in the NT. For example, the words like and driven by, 
both occurring in 1:6; or the word declarations (boasting) in 3:5; or the word stoker in 3:6. James’s 
writing is rich in metaphors and other figures of speech and is seasoned with words and concepts which 
came directly from his brother, such as the “trophy of life” in 1:12. James’s generous use of metaphors 
(like “bridle his tongue” in 1:26) and other figures of speech makes this a rich piece of literature and 
should be high on the list of books in the Bible that should be read purely for literary content, such as 
English class readings.
       But it’s more important to get the gist of what James says rather than parse with a fine-toothed 
comb his writing looking for logical fallacies, as his writing is similar to John’s, not written like a science 
textbook. A fair amount of interpolations are necessary to prevent the book from being lost on the 
reader. An example of this is 4:5, where he cites the Old Testament and Bible scholars can’t find the 
exact verse he’s quoting from.
       But after granting this allowance and understanding who James is, one begins to see things from 
his point of view. He talks about the “perfect code” and “freedom’s code” being the Law of Moses on 
the surface, but underneath focuses on the more important aspects of the Law that Jesus emphasized, 
such as loving your neighbor and helping the poor. Unlike many of the strict Jews of the day, James isn’t 
caught up in the rituals of the Law; a keeper of the Law will act in love towards others—not like the rich, 
whom he disdains since they are oppressive.
       Speaking of the rich, James defines the Judeo-Christian perspective of oppressor vs. oppressed, 
telling the oppressive-rich to stop oppressing the poor, excoriating them morally. This is unlike the 
Marxist perspective which seeks to eliminate the rich and change the entire economic system.
       James pulls in concepts from the Old Testament and gives us continuity, taking the cue from 
Jesus, as both James and Jesus teach that these concepts have not changed but have been better 
defined. The Law of Moses is the most prominent example, but there are other concepts such as “God is 
One” (2:19; 4:12) and what the nature of faith is.

*[B]a sacrificial offering consisting of praise…Lit: sacrifice of praise. This is a metaphor which compares 
praise offered to God to OT sacrifices offered to God and incinerated on the altar of burnt offerings. 
Some have misinterpreted this to mean that it is a personal sacrifice on our part to praise God.


James
       James addresses his epistle to Jewish believers, as he was the leader of the Jewish faction of the 
church. His wisdom is in the Semitic style that his brother Jesus used rather than the Greek style that 
Paul uses, giving it an unusual flavor which complements the other epistles.
       Church tradition holds that James prayed so much that his knees were calloused. His dedication 
to prayer comes across in the letter.
       Looking at the Greek text, James’s writing style is straightforward, shying away from some of the 
exotic verb tenses and particles one finds Luke and Paul using, but he also displays a deep vocabulary, 
using words which are not found anywhere else in the NT. For example, the words like and driven by, 
both occurring in 1:6; or the word declarations (boasting) in 3:5; or the word stoker in 3:6. James’s 
writing is rich in metaphors and other figures of speech and is seasoned with words and concepts which 
came directly from his brother, such as the “trophy of life” in 1:12. James’s generous use of metaphors 
(like “bridle his tongue” in 1:26) and other figures of speech makes this a rich piece of literature and 
should be high on the list of books in the Bible that should be read purely for literary content, such as 
English class readings.
       But it’s more important to get the gist of what James says rather than parse with a fine-toothed 
comb his writing looking for logical fallacies, as his writing is similar to John’s, not written like a science 
textbook. A fair amount of interpolations are necessary to prevent the book from being lost on the 
reader. An example of this is 4:5, where he cites the Old Testament and Bible scholars can’t find the 
exact verse he’s quoting from.
       But after granting this allowance and understanding who James is, one begins to see things from 
his point of view. He talks about the “perfect code” and “freedom’s code” being the Law of Moses on 
the surface, but underneath focuses on the more important aspects of the Law that Jesus emphasized, 
such as loving your neighbor and helping the poor. Unlike many of the strict Jews of the day, James isn’t 
caught up in the rituals of the Law; a keeper of the Law will act in love towards others—not like the rich, 
whom he disdains since they are oppressive.
       Speaking of the rich, James defines the Judeo-Christian perspective of oppressor vs. oppressed, 
telling the oppressive-rich to stop oppressing the poor, excoriating them morally. This is unlike the 
Marxist perspective which seeks to eliminate the rich and change the entire economic system.
       James pulls in concepts from the Old Testament and gives us continuity, taking the cue from 
Jesus, as both James and Jesus teach that these concepts have not changed but have been better 
defined. The Law of Moses is the most prominent example, but there are other concepts such as “God is 
One” (2:19; 4:12) and what the nature of faith is.

25|May the grace of God be with you all.


&JAMES 1
1|James, a servant/slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ:
      To the blood-descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel[A] who are among the 
Diaspora (i.e. the scattering of Jews all over the world):
      I’m delighted to write to you[a]:
          
2|Consider it a joy, my dear comrades, when you by chance fall into various tests 
and trials which find out what you’re made of, 
3|knowing that the process of proving 
your faith produces perseverance. 
4|Let perseverance have the opportunity to become a 
mature, completed work, in order that you would become mature and that every part of 
you would become complete with nothing left out.
          
5|But speaking of things which are left out…If someone is lacking in[b] wisdom, 
advise him to[B] simply ask for wisdom from the giving-God who’ll grant the request 
without chewing the person out or demeaning him, and it will be given to him. 
6|But 
admonish him to[B] ask in faith, nothing about him wavering in doubt: you see, a person 
who doubts is like the way that ocean waves are moved and tossed about by the wind. 

7|To this point, you should adjust[B] that person’s expectations so that he does not 
expect to receive anything from the Lord, 
8|since he is a double-minded man, 
irresolute in all his ways.
          
9|Get[B] the Humiliated, Abased Person to glory and take pride in his 
exaltation, 
10|and likewise get the rich man to practice humility and self-
abasement[C], because, like the wild flowers of the field[D] which reach an apex when 
they blossom and then fade back into obscurity, he too will have his moment in the sun 
then pass away and fade back into obscurity. 
11|You see, the sun rose and dried out 
the wild flower with its sweltering heat[c], its flower-part fell off, and the lovely 
appearance it projected was destroyed—this is the same way that the rich man will 
waste away in his journey through life.
          
12|Blessed is the man who perseveres over the course of tests and trials, since, 
after he’s attained approval because of his perseverance, he’ll receive the trophy[d] of a 
deeply satisfying life[E], which is promised to those who love Him. 
13|Teach[B] the 
person who’s being tested by some sort of trial or temptation not to say, “I’m being 
tested by God to see if there’s any evil in me.” You see, God is un-tempt-able by any evil; 
He tempts no one. 
14|Each person is tempted when he’s lured and dragged off by 
the passions which are peculiar to him and not necessarily to the next person. 
15|Then 
once passion or desire has conceived[F], it gives birth to sin. When it’s finished running 
its course, sin produces death (i.e., stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction).
          
16|Don’t get led down the primrose path, my dear comrades. 
17|Every 
good gift and every perfect present is from the sky above, coming down from the 
Creator of Astronomical Objects (i.e. the sun, the moon, stars, etc.), with whom there is 
no deviation in the movement of such objects and no hint or suggestion of change to 
them[G]. 
18|Having planned and decided to do so, he birthed us in[e] a 
conceptualization[f] of truth with the end-goal of us being the crème de la crème[g] of His 
creation.
          
19|Be sure you get this down pat, my dear comrades: Each person should 
see to it[B] that he’s quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger[h]. 
20|You see, a 
man’s anger won’t live up to God’s standards of right and wrong. 
21|In light of 
this, once you’ve rid yourself of any filthy residue[i] of malice, with a soft-spoken, gentle 
self-restraint take to heart and fully embrace the implanted word of God which is able to 
relieve, rescue, and preserve your mind and emotions[j].
          
22|But become practitioners of a given subject matter[k] and not just students 
who hear it taught, deceiving themselves because they listen but won’t do, 
23|because 
if somebody hears a subject lectured to him but doesn’t put it into practice, that guy’s 
like a man who looks at himself[l] in a mirror and gets an idea of what he looks like— 

24|you see, he got an idea of what he looks likes, walked away, and immediately 
forgot what he looks like[H]. 
25|But the fellow who crouched down and looked 
carefully at a perfect code, a freedom code, and stays put looking at it and didn’t become 
a forgetting-student but became a doing-practitioner, that fellow will be blessed in his 
doing.
          
26|If anyone thinks that he strictly adheres to the do’s and don’ts of his 
religion[I] and isn’t reigning in[m] his tongue but instead kids himself into believing he 
follows his religion strictly—this sort of religion is worthless. 
*[a]I’m delighted to write to you…Lit: joy. A common salutation found in the NT; same one in Matt. 26:49; 
ref. note there.
*[b]lacking in…Lit: left out. Same verb used in v. 4 nothing left out, and this verb is used in the same voice. 
James is obviously using this as a transition.
*[c]sweltering heat…Lit: burning wind
*[d]trophy…Lit: crown [in this context, a victor’s wreath]. Some liberties taken.
*[e]in…Or: by means of
*[f]conceptualization…Lit: word. Ref. John 1:1.
*[g]crème de la crème…Lit: first-fruits. Ref. note of Rom. 8:23.
*[h]quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger…James’s use of the Gk. aorist tense here is a bit 
unexpected. It’s as though he’s picturing a single, hypothetical instance and not speaking in generalities.
*[i]filthy residue…Lit: dirtiness and surplus [or superfluous; remaining]. An hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 
3:11.
*[j]relieve, rescue, and preserve your mind and emotions…Lit: save your soul
*[k]a given subject matter…Lit: a word. James uses the definite article with word in v. 21 but drops it in vv. 
22, 23.
*[l]looks at himself…Lit: notices his face
*[m]reigning in…Or: bridling. A metaphor which compares taming the tongue to taming a horse.
*[n]with the Father-God…Lit: with the God and Father. A hendiadys.

*[A]the blood-descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel …Lit: twelve tribes. The phrase twelve tribes is a 
metonymy for all Israelites. By specifying the twelve tribes, James makes the distinction between the 
Jewish believers and the Gentile believers. Since James’s authority is over the church in Jerusalem, and 
perhaps all of Israel, he extends his pastoral care to all believing Israelites who for one reason or another 
are located outside of Israel but nevertheless are Jewish like those living in Israel. At the time this epistle 
was written, there were more Jews outside of Israel than there were in Israel. But the schism in the early 
church between the Jewish and the non-Jewish believers would naturally cause the Jewish believers 
living outside of Israel to gravitate towards and affiliate with James.
*[B]advise him to…admonish him to…adjust…get…make sure that…etc…Lit: have [or let] him. James uses 
this third-person imperative form of the Gk. verb in a parallel fashion as a figure of speech.
*[C]likewise get the rich man to practice humility and self-abasement…Lit: the rich man in his humiliation. 
(The interpolations are justified by the parallel construction.) Before making generalizations about the 
wealthy based on this verse, one should first read James 2:6–7; 5:1–6 and understand that the “rich 
man” of that passage is the same “rich man” in v. 10,11 here. Though there’s a tendency for wealthy 
people to be abusive, not all of them are. But all of them are reminded to stay humble.
*[D]wild flowers of the field…Lit: grass. Max and Mary claim that in this context this refers to wild flowers 
and not grass and that this is a picture of fragility from the OT (ref. Is. 40:6; Ps. 103:15
*[E]trophy of a deeply satisfying life…Lit: crown [victor’s wreath] of life. This is a metaphor where obtaining 
a deeply satisfying life by persevering through trials is compared to a victor being awarded the victor’s 
wreath. The word life leans on the definition Jesus put forth in John 6:53, “if you won’t eat the Man’s 
flesh and drink his blood, you don’t have life within you.” In the next verse Jesus goes on to talk about 
eternal life, which is that special fullness of life that God gives. By this reasoning, the word life in v. 12 
here does not refer to physical existence but rather is the same concept of life and eternal life which 
Jesus taught. What James is saying is that perseverance through trials and temptations results in a deep 
richness to one’s life.
*[F]conceived…Same word used in Luke 1:24 when Elizabeth managed to become pregnant, insinuating a 
bit that this was only achieved after some difficulty. A few words later in this verse, James says gives 
birth to sin, where the word give birth is just that—a woman giving birth. This verse is a metaphor where 
temptation is compared to a man who impregnates a woman (i.e. a person) and she conceives a child sin 
and gives birth to it.
*[G]Creator of Astronomical Objects (i.e. the sun, the moon, the stars, etc.), with whom there is no 
deviation in the movement of such objects and no hint or suggestion of change to them…Lit: Father of 
Lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of changing. The same Gk. word for lights used here 
in v. 17 is the same Gk. word used in Gen. 1:16 in the LXX, “And God made the two great lights…”; 
therefore, the “lights” James refers to are the sun, the moon, and every other celestial object which 
emits light. The word shadow used in this verse is similar in meaning to the way it’s used in Heb. 10:1; 
i.e., it’s not a physical shadow but rather an imperfect representation of another object. The Gk. words 
for variation and changing are astronomical terms. In addition, it’s been known since ancient times that 
the movement of the planets, the rotation of the earth, etc. are extremely precise and entirely 
predictable. Therefore, James is saying that the same God who put into place such precision will apply 
the same precision to His gift-giving.
*[H]forgot what he looks like…James is describing what we all experience on a daily basis. While you’re 
looking in the mirror, you know exactly what you look like, but the moment you step away, you 
immediately forget what that was no matter how long you were staring into the mirror. Let’s say a 
woman looks in a mirror to see how her hair looks. She’ll step away, worry that this lock or that braid 
doesn’t quite match her outfit, then step back up to the mirror and look at herself again. Why did she 
step back to the mirror a second time?—Because she forgot what she looked like.
[I]thinks that he strictly adheres to the do’s and don’ts of his religion…Lit: thinks to be religious. Some 
liberties taken. The word religious insinuates the rituals performed by the Jews. This insinuation is 
confirmed by the selection of words James uses in v. 27, namely pure [undefiled] and unstained, which 
smack of Jewish religious purification rituals.

James
27|A pure set of 
religious do’s and don’ts—a set that’s untainted from the Father-God’s[n] point of 
view—is to visit orphans and widows in dire need for the purpose of helping them, 
while keeping oneself unstained from the world, i.e. the established order of humanity 
which wants nothing to do with God.


&JAMES 2
1|My comrades, don’t have a faith in our Lord of Glory Jesus Christ which 
shows favoritism. 
2|If a powerful businessman[a] wearing an expensive suit[b] were to 
join your synagogue[c], and a poor man in ragged[d] clothing were to join, 
3|you’d be 
naturally inclined to favor the fellow in the expensive suit and tell him, “Let’s make 
sure you’re seated up front in the reserved section where all the important people sit[A],” 
and you would tell the poor guy, “Stand against the wall in the back or sit where the 
usher sits and be ready to fill in for him and run an errand when we call[A].” 
4|Have 
you not shown bias towards those among you, preferring one person over another, and 
have you not become decision-makers[e] whose thought process consists of really bad, 
downright evil, things?
          
5|Listen, my dear comrades: Hasn’t God chosen the world’s poor to be rich in 
faith and to get their individual slice of God’s involvement with the human race[f], 
which He promised to those who love Him? 
6|But you’ve treated the poor with 
contempt. Don’t the rich oppress you and drag you into court? 
7|Don’t they cuss at, 
slander, and revile your excellent, hard-earned reputation[B]? 
8|If there really is a 
perfect regal code which we live by and if the code is based on the Bible verse which says, 
“Love your neighbor as yourself,” then you’re on the right track[g]. 
9|But if you show 
favoritism, you’re committing a sin and are incriminated by the Law of Moses. 
10|In 
fact, that particular individual who’s willingly trying to keep the Law but falls short[h] in 
one area is guilty of violating it as a whole.
          
11|Here’s an example: the same Old Testament Law which said “Don’t commit 
adultery” also said “Don’t commit murder.” Now if you didn’t commit adultery but 
committed murder, you nevertheless became a Law-violator, violating the Law as a whole 
even though you violated just one part of it. 
12|Talk and behave as though as though 
you’re going to be held to a standard defined by freedom’s code and judged by it. 

13|You see, the judgment that you will eventually face will be merciless towards 
those who won’t show mercy. Mercy trumps judgment.
          
14|What benefit is it, my comrades, if (using some person for the purpose of 
illustration) this person says he has faith but has no actions which normally accompany it? 
That sort of so-called faith[D] won’t pull him out of a bad situation[i], will it? 
15|If a 
comrade were to find himself or herself having no clothing whatsoever to protect his or 
her body with and lacking minimum-sustenance food, 
16|and if you were to tell 
him, “See you later, take care now[j]. Stay warm and get plenty to eat,” but not provide 
physical necessities for him, what good is that? 
17|The sort of faith we’re talking 
about here is the same way: if it were to not have actions which normally accompany it, it 
would be[k] void of life, being in a state which is consistent with itself.
          
18|Putting that aside now—someone is bound to say, “You have faith but no 
actions to go along with it and I have actions but no faith to go along with them.” Show me 
your kind of faith apart from the actions which normally accompany it, and I’ll show you 
the genuine kind of faith from out of my actions. 
19|You believe that there is only 
one true God and that He is of one mind and has His own will, and there is no other being 
comparable to Him[E]? Good job. The demons believe it as well and quiver in their boots 
over it[l].
          
20|Oh you nit-wit—were you interested in knowing that the sort of faith 
which is apart from actions which normally accompany it amounts to nothing[m]? 

21|Wasn’t our patriarch Abraham made right in God’s sight[n] from actions after 
offering his son Isaac upon the altar? 
22|In the case of Abraham offering Isaac, one sees 
that the genuine sort of faith operates together with its accompanying actions and comes to 
fruition out of the actions. 
23|The verse of Scripture was fulfilled which says, 
“Abraham believed in God, and it wound up being credited to him as righteousness,” 
and he was called a friend and close-companion of God. 
24|Observe that a person 
is made right in God’s sight as the result of actions and not by faith on its own.[F] 

25|Wasn’t the prostitute Rahab made right in God’s sight the same way—as the 
result of actions—cooperating with the agents and hurrying them out another way? 

*[a]a powerful businessman…Lit: a gold-ringed man. Gold-ringed is a synecdoche. The ring on the man’s 
finger is a signet ring, a ring used for making sizeable purchases or validating transactions.
*[b]wearing an expensive suit…Lit: in bright clothes. Some liberties taken. Only the rich and noblemen 
wore bright clothing. 
*[c]join your synagogue…Lit: enter into your synagogue. An idiom; ref. note of Acts 19:8.
*[d]ragged…Lit: filthy-dirty
*[e]decision-makers…Lit: judges
*[f]get their own individual slice of God’s involve with the human race…Lit: inheritors of the kingdom
*[g]then you’re on the right track…Lit: you do well
*[h]falls short…Lit: stumbles. A less-common word for stumble [patiō,(πταίω/Strong’s 4417)] than the one 
usually used [skandalon, (σκάνδαλον/Strong’s 4625)], but both are Gk. renderings of the OT word 
stumble. Ref. note of Matt. 11:6.
*[i]pull him out of a bad situation…Lit: save him
*[j]See you later, take care now…Lit: Go forth in peace. A common parting remark.
*[k]would be…Lit: is. A grammatical error made by James, presumably.
*[l]quiver in their boots over it…Lit: shudder. Some liberties taken.
*[m]amounts to nothing…Lit: idle
*[n]made right in God’s sight…Lit: justified

*[A]Let’s make sure you’re seated up front in the reserved section where all the important people sit…Stand 
against the wall in the back or sit where the usher sits and be ready to fill in for him and run an errand 
when we call…Lit: Sit here good…Stand there or sit under my footstool. Liberties taken. Unlike modern 
times, in ancient times, people at an event were not seated randomly but were seated in seats that 
were arranged so that one could tell their importance at the function by the location of the seat in 
proximity to whatever is the center. Also, the phrase sit under my footstool is a NT expression which 
means that such person is subordinate to whomever he’s seated under.
*[B]cuss at, slander, and revile your excellent, hard-earned reputation…Lit: blaspheme the beautiful name 
[or excellent reputation] that’s been given as a surname to you. Many scholars assume that James is 
talking about blaspheming God’s name, but a literal interpretation does not support this assumption.
*[C]perfect regal code…Lit: perfect royal law. James 1:25 “perfect law” refers to this same concept. The 
perfect law transcends the legalistic practice of the Law of Moses and lays down a better, perfect, and 
higher code of conduct, the same one that Jesus talked about in the Sermon on the Mount when he 
said, “It is written but I say.”
*[D]That sort of faith…Lit: the faith. In the Gk. James adds the definite article before the word faith to 
indicate that he’s talking about a specific type of so-called faith. He adds a the before faith in in various 
places in the passage of v. 14–17.
*[E]there is only one true God. He is of one mind and has His own will, and there is no other being 
comparable to Him…Lit: God is one. Also appears in 1 Cor. 8:4; Rom. 3:29; Gal. 3:20: this is a quotation 
from Deut. 6:4. The brevity of the statement only enhances its profoundness, as it speaks to so many 
things about God. This one statement is the foundation for all Abrahamic religions.
[F]Observe that a person is made right in God’s sight as the result of actions and not by faith on its 
own…The passage consisting of vv. 14–26 has been misunderstood for years, even to the point where 
Martin Luther refused to include the book of James in his translation of the Bible, as he thought James is 
promoting a righteousness based on works. He’s not. The point James makes is that genuine faith is 
always accompanied by works (actions) which reflect it and are the result of it. Genuine faith cannot 
exist without these accompanying actions. This does not mean that if a person manufactures the actions 
they necessarily have the works, but it means that the two must go hand-in-hand.

&JAMES 3
1|There should not be a lot of you becoming instructors[A], my comrades, 
knowing that we’ll be held to a higher standard[a]. 
2|You see, we all mess up or fall 
short[b] in many ways. If a given person doesn’t mess up in speech, that fellow has got 
his act together[c], able to reign in his entire body[B] as well. 
3|Now we[d] stick bits in 
the mouths of horses in order to prevail upon them to do our bidding, and in doing so 
we guide their entire bodies. 
4|Ships too, for example, are gigantic and are propelled 
by stiff breezes, guided by the smallest thing imaginable—a rudder—in whatever 
heading the helmsman selects. 
5|Analogous to this, the tongue is a small part of a 
much larger unit and makes outrageous remarks[C].
      I’m telling you what, it’s like they say: “Just a tiny flame can set even an enormous 
forest on fire[e].” 
6|And the tongue is a flame indeed, an elaborate mechanism[f] of 
wrong-doing—the tongue occupies a position of preeminence[g] among our body 
parts—the defiler of the entire body and stoker of the Merry-go-round of Life[D]—and is 
itself stoked by hell.
          
7|In fact, human beings by nature tame wild animals. All sorts—land, aquatic, 
reptilian—are in the process of being tamed and have been tamed, 
8|but not a single 
person can tame the restless, unstable tongue, full of deadly poison. 
9|With it we 
thank the Father-God[h] and with it we swear at our fellow man, those who have been 
created in the image of God. 
10|Out of the same mouth come thanksgiving and 
cussing. This is not the way it’s supposed to be, my comrades. 
11|Non-
contaminated and contaminated water doesn’t pour out of the same spring, now does it? 

12|It’s not possible, my comrades, for a fig tree to yield olives or a grape vine figs, 
or for a water source to produce both salt water and fresh water, is it?
          
13|Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him display his deeds 
which come from the good conduct of one who follow’s God’s commandments in wisdom’s 
gentleness. 
14|But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your heart, don’t 
distort the truth by bragging and lying[i]. 
15|This is not the same wisdom which 
comes from the spiritual world where God lives[j], but is the cunning-sort of wisdom which 
is among other things ruthlessly pragmatic, psychopathic, and diabolic[E]. 
16|The fact 
is, where jealousy and rivalry exist, there is turmoil, and every bad thing imaginable is 
done[k]. 
17|But the wisdom from the spiritual world where God lives is pure and 
innocent, then on top of that is peaceful, considerate, reasonable, full of mercy, and 
without pretense. 
*[a]we’ll be held to a higher standard…Lit: we will receive a greater judgment
*[b]mess up or fall short…Lit: stumble. Same word used in James 2:10, see note there.
*[c]that fellow has got his act together…Lit: that man complete
*[d]Now we…Lit: Now if. Appears to be a mistake in the autograph; some early manuscripts have redacted 
it out.
*[e]Just a tiny flame can even set an enormous forest on fire…Lit: How small a flame how great a forest 
kindles. In the GT this is: hālikon pur hālikān hulān anaptei (ἡλίκον πῦρ ἡλίκην ὕλην ἀνάπτει). An 
obvious alliteration/assonance and presumably a commonly-used expression.
*[f]elaborate mechanism…Lit: a world. Keep in mind that world refers to the established order of mankind 
more so than the physical planet.
*[g]occupies a position of preeminence…Lit: sits. The meaning of the word sits as used in this verse is the 
same meaning as it’s used in Ps. 110:1.
*[h]Father-God…Lit: God and Father. A commonly-used NT hendiadys.
*[i]distort the truth by bragging and lying…Lit: boast and lie against the truth. Assuming this is an idiom 
and guessing what the idiom means.
*[j]which comes from the spiritual world where God lives…Lit: coming down from above
*[k]every bad thing imaginable is done…Lit: all bad deeds. The word all is used as a figure of speech, a 
hyperbole or metonymy of a sort. Same figure of speech used in 1 Tim. 6:10, “For the love of money is 
the root of all evil.”
*[l]the end-result where everything turns out right has its origins…Lit: the fruit of righteousness is sown

*[A]instructors…Or: teachers. The Gk. word for teacher is both (or either) one who imparts insight and 
understanding and one who gives moral instruction (ref. note of Acts 15:1), telling the pupil how he 
should conduct his life. In relation to giving moral instruction, it becomes clear why the instructor must 
be held to a higher standard.
*[B]reign in his entire body…Lit: able to bridle his entire body. The word bits in v. 3 is derived from the 
bridle in v. 2. This combined with the repetition of the word body in v. 2 and bodies in v. 3 indicates that 
reign in his entire body is a metaphor which compares controlling one’s body by controlling one’s tongue 
to controlling a horse’s body by the use of bits. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), the word body in the NT 
sometimes means carnal nature. Putting this together, like bridling a horse a person who can control his 
tongue will be able to bring his carnal nature under control.
*[C]makes outrageous remarks…Lit: boasts great things. The word boasts [aucheo, (αὐχέω/Strong’s 850a)] 
is used here instead of the commonly-used NT word kauchaomai (καυχάομαι/Strong’s 2744). This verse 
is the only place in the NT that aucheo is found, and the lexicon says that in a general sense it means to 
protest, declare.
*[D]the Merry-go-round of Life…Or: the Engine of Life…Lit: the Wheel of Origin. James is using the well-
known metaphorical concept of a wheel, where a wheel represents cycles which keep on repeating 
themselves. This metaphorical use predates James by centuries, having its roots in astrology and 
mythology. For example, the term “Wheel of Fortune (Rota Fortunae)” is derived from this same 
concept.
[E]among other things ruthlessly pragmatic, psychopathic, and diabolic…Lit: earthly, mental, demonic. 
Earthly refers to a Machiavellian-sort of cunning. Keep in mind that the Gk. word for wisdom means 
both wisdom and cunning. Mental means a wisdom which is mental and emotional in contradiction to 
being spiritual; is concerned with this life only. It is mental thought which like an animal has, where, for 
example, an ape can tear apart another ape or eat another ape’s baby and have no remorse for it. 
Demonic (diabolic) patterns itself after an evil imp which goes around harassing people.

&JAMES 4
1|Where do the long, drawn-out quarrels[a] and fights among you come from? 
Is it not from the pleasurable carnal impulses[A] which are a component of your human 
nature[B], enlisted in a war against you? 
2|You desire but don’t have anything to show 
for it—murder and covet but don’t attain—fight and have long, drawn-out quarrels—
You don’t have on account of you not asking. 
3|You ask and don’t receive because 
you ask with bad intentions, asking for something for the purpose of spending it on your 
carnal impulses[b]. 
4|Spiritual adulterers, don’t you know that a close friend of the 
world (i.e. the ungodly society of mankind) is pitted against God? So now, he who wishes 
he were the world’s close friend puts himself in a position[c] where he’s God’s enemy. 

5|Or do you think that the verse of Scripture which says “The Spirit that has taken up 
residence in us and among us jealously longs and desires for hearts turned towards 
Him[C]” is a waste of time?
          
6|Now the Bible lets us off the hook all the more[d]; owing to this it says,

God takes a stance against the arrogant, proud, and haughty
But He lets the humble and abased off the hook[d]

          
7|So submit to God.[D] Take a stand against the devil and he’ll run away from 
you. 
8|Draw closer to God, and He’ll draw closer to you. Purge your life from wrong-
doing[e], sinners, and set your hearts apart from impurity and make them holy, you who 
are double-minded. 
9|Recognize your deplorable moral and spiritual condition and become 
wretched and miserable over it; become deeply sorrowful similar to the way you would 
mourn the death of a loved one, and weep. Have your laughter turn into deep sorrow 
and your joy into gloom. 
10|Humble and abase yourself before the Lord, and he 
will uplift and exalt you.
          
11|Don’t put others down[f] while talking, comrades. He who puts a 
comrade down or draws conclusions about his comrade so as to write him off[g] trashes 
the rules that govern us and writes them off by his speech[E]. Now if you write a set of 
rules off, you’re not a practitioner of the rule-set but instead are a person who decides if 
the rules themselves are right or wrong[h]. 
12|There’s only One who’s lawgiver and 
decider[h], He who’s able to preserve[i] and destroy. Who do you think you are, you who 
writes off those around you regularly?
          
13|Come on now, those of you who say “Today or maybe even tomorrow 
we’ll go to such-and-such town, spend a year there engaged in business, and turn a 
profit.” 
14|You all are the very people who don’t understand how your lives will 
turn out given the ups and downs that tomorrow brings[j]. You see, you’re a wisp of 
steam that appears for a little while then vanishes. 
15|Instead, the statement you 
should make is, “If it happens to be the Lord’s will, and if we’re still alive, we’ll do this-
or-that.” 
16|You’re vaunting at the present time by your pretentious, ostentatious 
swagger. All such vaunting is evil[k]. 
*[a]long, drawn-out quarrels…Lit: wars. A hyperbole.
*[b]carnal impulses…Lit: pleasures. Same word used in v. 1.
*[c]puts himself in a position…Lit: sets. Same word is translated occupies the position in James 3:6.
*[d]lets us off the hook all the more…Lit: gives a greater grace [mercy]
*[e]purge your life from wrong-doing…Lit: clean [the] hands. An expression.
*[f]put others down…Or: speaks down on [against] others; trash talks others
*[g]draws conclusions about his comrade so as to write him off…Lit: judges his brother. Ref. note of Matt. 
7:1.
*[h]a person who decides if the rules themselves are right or wrong…decider…Lit: judge [of law]
*[i]preserve…Lit: save
*[j]how your lives will turn out given the ups and downs that tomorrow brings…Lit: he of the tomorrow 
what sort of your life. This does lend itself to a literal translation.
*[k]evil…Or: absolutely awful. The word evil here is a bit of a hyperbole.

*[A]pleasurable carnal impulses…Lit: pleasures. This is the Gk. word which hedonistic is derived from. 
James is talking about the pleasure one gets from indulging in one’s carnal nature. For example, the 
pleasure it gives you to fly off the handle and scream at someone; the pleasure when you stab someone 
in the back whom you dislike; the pleasure of lusting after a scantily-clad woman.
*[B]component of your human nature…Lit: in your members. The word members is short for members of 
the body. The theory held by the writers of the NT is that a person’s carnal nature is a part of their body 
(Rom. 7:18,23). This carnal nature is referred to as the flesh, the body, or simply “members.” This is 
another reason why a believer receives a new body in the afterlife: the new body has no carnal 
component.
*[C]The Spirit that has taken up residence in us and among us jealously longs and desires for hearts turned 
towards Him…Lit: The Spirit that has taken up residence in us and among us jealously longs and desires. 
The last part for hearts turned towards Him is an interpolation, as it’s my best-guess as to what James 
meant. All theories on this verse have logical holes in them, but I assume that he’s paraphrasing (there is 
no exact OT quote) Exod. 20:5, “I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.” The OT says that He’s jealous for 
the affections of His people. James combines with this the OT concept of God dwelling among Israel. 
Like the other theories, there are contradictions to this one. Keep in mind that James is not writing a 
science textbook.
*[D]So submit to God…James uses an out-of-place verb tense (aorist imperative) throughout this 
paragraph for the purpose of jarring the reader even harder. It also insinuates that he means for the 
reader to do what he’s telling them to do in the paragraph one time and be done with, as opposed to 
doing it over and over.
[E]trashes the rules that govern us and writes them off by his speech…Lit: speaks against law and judges 
law. Note the missing definite articles before the word law in three places in this verse. Though the 
word law here might insinuate Law of Moses, the missing articles skew the meaning to a broader, 
conceptual use of the word law.

&JAMES 5
1|Come on now, you rich people who act like the stereotypical rich[A], weep and 
wail[a] over the miseries that assail you[b]. 
2|Your wealth has rotted and your fancy 
clothes have been eaten by moths. 
3|Your hoard of gold and silver has corroded, and 
its corrosion will show you just how guilty you are[c] and eat you alive[d] as though 
being burned at the stake: you’ve stashed valuables away in this era in which God is 
doing the great things He promised He’d do[B]. 
4|Take a look—the wages which 
you’ve withheld from the workers scything your grain fields cry out, and these outcries 
have secured the attention of the Great Unseen Army Chief of Staff[C], and He is favorably 
disposed to wage war on the workers’ behalf. 
5|You have lived the life of luxury in the 
midst of the going-ons of this life[e] and have indulged in every pleasure. You fattened 
your hearts in a day of slaughter (i.e., just like a cow is fed extra grain to fatten it up right 
before it’s slaughtered, your heart has been fed and has become fat and is well-primed to be 
slaughtered during this present cattle-slaughter season). 
6|You condemned—you 
MURDERED—the righteous. They don’t even try to fight you off[f].
          
7|So be patient, comrades, until the Lord appears on the scene. Take a look at 
how your typical farmer awaits the valuable crop that the soil produces, how he applies 
patience through the course of it all[g], ultimately getting[h] the Planting Rains and the 
Harvesting Rains. 
8|You too be patient, make your hearts resolute, because the Lord 
is getting closer and closer to coming. 
9|Don’t groan at each other in exasperation, 
comrades, so that you not be judged. Take a look—the judge is waiting for someone to 
give him the nod to take action[i]. 
10|For example, comrades, take a look at the 
suffering of the prophets, who spoke with the mouth of the Lord. 
11|There you 
have it: blessed are they who endure. You heard about the endurance of Job and saw 
how the Lord’s dealings with him turned out, that He was full of pity and was 
compassionate too.
          
12|Now first and foremost, my dear comrades, don’t swear oaths: don’t 
pledge any oath by the sky[D] (including heaven itself) nor by the earth. Let a simple 
“yes” be your yes-answer, and simple “no” be your no-answer, in order not to incur a 
tremendous burden of guilt[j].
          
13|Is anyone among you enduring hardship?—Have him pray. Anyone 
cheerful?—Have him sing for joy. 
14|Anyone run-down with a malady of some 
sort[k]?—Have him summon the church governing board[l], have them pray over him 
after rubbing oil on him (or coating him in oil) acting under the authority of the Lord[m], 

15|and the prayer of faith will restore the health of the one who’s ill, and the Lord 
will get him back on his feet and going[n]. And if he has committed sins, he’ll be 
forgiven.
          
16|Confess your sins out loud to each other, comrades, and pray for each 
other, in order to be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is capable of accomplishing 
a lot. 
17|Elijah was a person who experienced the same emotions that we do and 
prayed a tremendous prayer[o] that it wouldn’t rain, and it didn’t rain all over the place[p] 
for three and a half years. 
18|He prayed again and the sky issued forth rain, and 
out of the ground sprouted the plants that the Earth produces.
          
19|My dear comrades: if any person should wander from the truth and 
someone were to get him back on track, 
*[a]weep and wail…Lit: weep while wailing. A figure of speech that adds intensity.
*[b]assail you…Lit: come upon you. This is an expression used throughout the Bible that means something 
which assaults you and likely overcomes you.
*[c]show you just how guilty you are…Or: point out your guilt to you…Lit: be a witness to you
*[d]eat you alive…Lit: eat your flesh
*[e]in the midst of the going-ons of this life…Lit: upon the [face of the] earth. A biblical metonymy (ref. Gen 
1:2 (face of the water); Gen. 7:23; Gen. 11:8 (whole earth); Gen. 11:8; Luke 21:35. The face of the earth 
stands in for the affairs of those who dwell on it.
*[f]They don’t even try to fight you off…Lit: he does not oppose [or: resist; lit: deploy against] you. The 
change from singular to plural of he to they is a result of the righteous (a figure of speech) being singular 
in form but plural in meaning.
*[g]applies patience through the course of it all…Lit: patient at it
*[h]ultimately getting…Lit: until he gets
*[i]is waiting for someone to give him the nod to take action…Lit: stands before the doors. Stand before 
the door is an idiom; also used in Acts 5:9; Rev. 3:20.
*[j]in order not to incur a tremendous burden of guilt…Lit: in order that you won’t fall under judgment
*[k]run down with a malady of some sort…Lit: weak. Ref. note of Matt. 4:23.
*[l]governing board…Lit: elders
*[m]acting under the authority of the Lord…Lit: in the name of the Lord
*[n]get him back on his feet and going…Lit: raise him up
*[o]prayed a tremendous prayer…Lit: prayed with a prayer. The repetition is a figure of speech.
*[p]all over the place…Lit: on the earth. An idiom used throughout the Bible.
*[q]rescue his psychological well-being (and perhaps even his very life) from waste, ruin, destruction, and 
worthlessness…Lit: saves his soul from death

*[A]you rich people who act like the stereotypical rich…Lit: the rich. The usage of the definite article the 
means that James is referring to a stereotype. Not all rich people behave the way James describes, but 
plenty of them do.
*[B]in this era in which God is doing the great things He promised He’d do…Lit: in the Last Days. The Last 
Days is an expression used throughout the Bible. In the OT it’s the era in which God’s promises come to 
pass. This usually is not eschatological.
*[C]have secured the attention of the Great Unseen Army Chief of Staff…Lit: have entered into the ear of 
[the] Lord of Hosts. The common expression enter into the ear paints a picture of gaining the attention 
of a person who’s difficult to reach because of his limited accessibility due to his high position—but it 
implies that this high-ranking person is disposed to deliberate in a favorable manner. The title Lord of 
Hosts [the army] appears throughout the OT and naturally refers to God heading his army of angels. 
Angels in this case symbolize the exercise of God’s supreme power in judgment, and this often takes 
place when the longsuffering patience of God has been exhausted.
[D]don’t pledge any oath by the sky…Swearing by something was a common practice in Israel at the time, 
one which Jesus spoke against in Matt. 23:16,17 and other places. This is like the oath Don Corleone 
made, “I swear on the souls of my grandchildren that I will not be the one to break the peace that we 
have made here today.”


1 Peter
       The final one of the multiple faces we see of Peter is contained in his epistle, and it’s hard to 
imagine them being the same person. The Peter of the Gospels is impulsive; the Peter of Acts is the first 
church leader; the Peter of Galatians is called out for wrong-doing—but the Peter of this epistle is 
gracious and mature.
       Peter the pastor admonishes the readers in a positive manner, steering them in the right 
direction, calling them to a higher walk with the Lord, encouraging them, reminding them of who they 
now are.
       Like other epistles, the Greek text is choppy, as one expects in a letter. A translator finds himself 
gleaning the gist of what Peter writes and wording it in his native language, deviating from the word-for-
word methodology. Sometimes the letter appears to have grammatical errors or the literal reading isn’t 
so logical (an example is 2:5). The novice reader may have trouble following all of Peter’s OT references. 
In spite of the fact that what Peter says isn’t written in a straightforward manner, Peter’s message is 
clear. Case in point is the beginning of the third chapter, when Peter is talking about what women wear. 
Logical?—not exactly. But the point is clear.
       Peter’s epistle is tender and commends what some would categorize as feminine virtues (3:8), 
and he has obviously been transformed from the impetuous fisherman of the Gospels. But his epistles 
hops about from here to there, randomly redirected to apocalyptic insights and symbolism found in the 
Old Testament a few verses later (3:19–22). The speed at which Peter makes points, but then hops to 
another topic, is breathtaking. He never lets the foot off the gas pedal, covering a lot of ground in a 
short letter. Upon reading the epistle in one sitting, the reader will likely affirm that everything which 
could have been said was said and that nothing more need be added.

&PET1 1
1|Peter, missionary[a] of Jesus Christ:
      To the specially chosen temporary residents[b] (namely, the scattered believers of 
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia) 
2|chosen by the Holy Spirit 
according to the foreknowledge of the Father-God and directed towards obedience and 
towards a ceremonial-like sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ (just like Moses ratified the 
covenant by sprinkling oxen blood over the people[c]):
      Grace to you, and peace too, and may they come to you in wave after wave[d].
          
3|The blessed God and Father[e] of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the 
enormous amount of mercy He has, has rebirthed us to a living hope through the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead 
4|and to an imperishable, unsullied, non-
deteriorating Customized Allocation[A] tucked away for us in both the spiritual domain 
and heaven itself[B]— 
5|we who by God’s power are being protected through faith and 
directed towards a rescue program[f] to be revealed in the thick of it all[g]— 
6|and in 
the thick of it all we are jubilant, if it so happens that at the moment we must undergo the 
distress caused by various trials, 
7|so that the passing grade earned by our faith—a 
passing grade many times more precious than perishable-gold[h] (but is verified to be 
pure by melting it in a furnace[C])—would be found to result in praise, glory, and honor 
in an unveiling of who Jesus Christ is. 
8|You love him whom you don’t see; you 
believe in him whom at the moment you’re not familiar with through direct sensory 
contact, and you exuberate with inexpressible, glorious joy, 
9|taking possession of the 
end-result of your faith: a rescue and preservation program for your mind and 
emotions and for your very lives as well[i].
          
10|About this “rescue and preservation program”…prophets researched 
and examined aspects of the grace that was prophesied into[j] you, 
11|looking into 
which individuals or which particular timeframe the Spirit of Christ in them was 
specifying over and over, going on record before it happened stating the circumstances 
of the Messiah’s suffering and the glory which followed. 
12|It was revealed to 
them that the prophesies which were uttered through their ministries weren’t given for[k] 
themselves but for you, namely the things you’ve been told already by the 
evangelizations of the Gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which 
the angels long to peer into.
          
13|Therefore, having poised your minds for action[l], being clear and level-
headed[m] to the utmost extent, hope for the grace delivered to you in an unveiling of 
who Jesus Christ is. 
14|As obedient children, don’t be molded by the carnal desires 
you had in your previous life of ignorance, 
15|but in pace with your holy calling 
into the Faith, get to where[n] you’re holy in all of your conduct as well, 
16|because 
it’s written, “Be holy since I Myself am holy.”
          
17|And if you call on a Father who judges each person impartiality on the 
basis of their actions, live out the time you spend on this planet[o] in fear, 

18|knowing that you were not bought back with perishable silver or gold from 
your pointless, useless lifestyle handed down from your ancestors, 
19|but with 
precious blood like one gets from a sacrificial lamb without defects or spots, namely 
Christ. 
20|While, yes, he was known beforehand starting from day-one[p], but aside 
from that he’s made an appearance at a critical point in time[q] for your sakes: 

21|you who through him believe in God, who raised him from the dead and 
glorified him, so that our faith and hope would be set on God.
          
22|Now that our mind and emotions and our very lives as well have been 
purified by the obedience of truth to a genuine enjoyment of and close friendship to our 
fellow man, love one another fervently out of pure hearts, 
23|having been 
rebirthed not from perishable seed but from imperishable, through the living Word of 
God—and the Word remains with us. 
24|Therefore the Bible says:

Every physical body
And man’s attempts to live righteously apart from God
—And let’s throw in the carnal nature[r]—
Is like grass
And when the flesh is at its finest moment,
At the pinnacle of its beauty and achievement[s],
Is like the blossoming of the grass’s flowers.
The grass eventually withers,
And the blossoms fall off,

*[a]missionary…Lit: apostle
*[b]temporary residents…Lit: sojourners
*[c]just like Moses ratified the covenant by sprinkling oxen blood over the people…Ref. Exod. 24:7,8
*[d]may they come to you in wave after wave…Lit: be multiplied
*[e]God and Father…An hendiadys in some respects. Ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[f]rescue program…Lit: salvation
*[g]the thick of it all…Lit: in [the] last time. Last time, last day, last hour are expressions.
*[h]perishable gold…An expression or perhaps an idiom; used here, in 1:18, in Acts 8:20. Not sure what it 
exactly means.
*[i]mind and emotions and for your very lives as well…Lit: soul
*[j]into…Or: in
*[k]for…Lit: to
*[l]having poised your minds for action…Lit: having girded the loins of your minds. A metaphor. Ref. Luke 
12:37.
*[m]clear and level-headed…Lit: sober. Somewhat of a metaphor.
*[n]get to where…Lit: become
*[o]spend on this planet…Lit: sojourn (like in a foreign country)
*[p]starting from day-one…Lit: from the foundation of the world. A biblical expression; also used in Matt. 
13:35, 25:34.
*[q]critical point in time…Lit: at the last of times. Last times is a biblical expression.
*[r]Every physical body and man’s attempts to live righteously apart from God—and let’s throw in the 
carnal nature…Lit: all flesh
*[s]when the flesh is at its finest moment, at the pinnacle of its beauty and achievement…Lit: its glory

*[A]Customized Allocation…Or: Special Parcel…Lit: inheritance. The word inheritance as used in the NT 
leverages the concept of an inheritance from the OT (ref. note of Luke 10:25), then applies this to the 
covenant of the NT. To recap, just as God in the OT had a specific piece of land for His people to dwell in, 
He has a specific place where He wants His NT people to “dwell.” This NT “land” is not a physical land 
but is a place, spiritually speaking, where God has allocated for his people and has tailored it specifically 
for each Christian denomination and even each Christian individually, just like the land of Israel in the 
time of Joshua was partitioned by tribe, by clan, and finally by family. This spiritual “land” consists of 
promises given in the Bible; of the movement of the Holy Spirit collectively in a denomination, a church, 
and even customized down to the individual: a special gift or calling for each person.
*[B]in both the spiritual domain and heaven itself…Lit: heaven. The Gk. word heaven has multiple 
meanings depending on the context. Paul mentioned that there are at least three “heavens” (2 Cor.

1 Peter
25|But the Word of the Lord remains forever.

This very same “Word of the Lord” is the evangelized-message which was put to you.


&PET1 2
1|So putting aside all malice, all guile or deceitful trickery, hypocrisy, envy, 
and the bad-mouthing of others, 
2|just like a newborn baby yearns for milk, yearn for 
the (logical analogy to the[A]) pure milk[B], in order that by it you would grow into the 
rescue program, the program which keeps you from calamity[a], 
3|since—surely 
now[C]—you’ve tasted that the Lord is exceedingly proficient and kind.
          
4|Coming to him—a living stone—who failed inspection and was rejected by 
humans on the one hand but with God is chosen and precious on the other. 
5|And 
you as living stones—living stones which form a spiritual edifice—you yourselves are 
being constructed into a holy priesthood to offer up[b] spiritual sacrifices (analogous to 
animal sacrifices) acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
6|Therefore the Bible[c] 
contains this:

See here now: I’m putting a stone in place
In that conceptual, symbolic, idealized city Zion—
A chosen, precious cornerstone.
There’s no way at all 
That the one who believes and trusts in him
Will be disappointed or put to shame—
Not a chance.


7|So honor and value goes to you believers. But to those who refuse to believe:

A stone which the builders
Failed during inspection and rejected—
That’s the one which became
The main corner of the foundation.


8|…And:

A stone which causes one to veer off into a ditch
Resulting in wrong-doing
And also a rock which offends[D]

Those who veer off into a ditch by not believing in the Word: like the stone which has been 
put in place in Zion, they too have been “put in place[d]” to that ends.
          
9|But you are “A select generation, a royal priesthood, a holy people sharing 
the same heritage and culture, a people for safe keeping, so that you all would proclaim 
the awesomeness[e]” of the One who’s called you out of darkness to His marvelous light.


10|Back then they were not a people
But now are a people of God.
They had not been shown mercy
But now are being shown mercy.

          
11|Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to stay away 
from carnal desires, the very things which wage war against the psyche. 

12|Maintain a lifestyle of good behavior among those who aren’t Christians[f], so 
that in the particular area in which they slander you as being a bad person[E], out of 
observing the good things which you do, upon close, careful examination[g] they would 
come clean and tell the truth[h] concerning the area in question about your behavior.
          
13|Submit[F] to every man-made position of authority[i] established through the 
Lord[j], whether the authority be in the form of a supreme leader—a king— 
14|or 
whether it be in the form of his appointees—governors—appointed to punish evildoers on 
the one hand but on the other praise those who do good. 
15|One submits because this 
is the way the will of God works: you shut the ignorance of stupid people up by doing 
good 
16|as those who have freedom—but not the sort of freedom which, under the 
surface, a bad person is concealed but the sort of freedom which conceals slaves of God 
instead. 
17|Honor everyone, love the band of fellow believers[k], have reverence 
(fear even) for God, honor the king.
          
18|The household servants: I assume you are but if not you should be 
submitting[l] with utmost reverence to every master, not only to the good-natured and 
considerate ones but to the corrupt ones as well. 
19|You see, this is the very picture 
of grace (i.e. forbearance, benevolence, and forgiveness): if by a godly conscience 
someone endures the pains of unfair suffering. 
20|When you get right down to it, 
what sort of congratulations should you expect if you endure the abuse and reprimands—
even getting slapped around[m]—for wrong-doing? But if you do good and endure 
suffering, this is the very picture of grace from[n] God.
          
21|You’ve been summoned to this ends: that Christ also suffered, suffered 
on behalf of everyone, leaving behind an example so that you would follow in the 
footsteps of him…


22|…Who committed no sin
Nor was guile found in his mouth


23|He who was reviled, while he was being reviled did not revile and abuse in 
return; while suffering, refrained from issuing threats; but kept handing his life over to 
Him who judges fairly— 
24|Who personally offered up our sins in his body upon 
the wooden cross-beam[o] so that having been separated from the sins, we would live in 
righteousness—Who with his wounds you were healed. 
*[a]the rescue program, the program which keeps you from calamity…Lit: salvation
*[b]to offer up…The Gk. verb tense is aorist and not present, which implies that it’s a one-time offering. 
This is unexpected.
*[c]the Bible…Lit: Scripture
*[d]put in place…This is the same word used in v.6 and refers to that verse
*[e]awesomeness…Lit: excellencies
*[f]those who aren’t Christians…Lit: Gentiles
*[g]upon close, careful examination…Lit: in a [or perhaps the] day of examination. Note that day of is a 
biblical expression. Note that many translations use the word visitation [from episkeptomai, 
(ἐπισκέπτομαι/Strong’s 1980)] and not examination [from episkopeō, (ἐπισκοπέω/Strong’s 1983)]. The 
Gk. word used here is episkopas (ἐπισκοπῆς), which is a noun form of episkopeō —not a form of 
episkeptomai (although episkopeō and episkeptomai are similar and are related etymologically).
*[h]come clean and tell the truth…Lit: glorify God. An idiom; ref. note of John 9:24.
*[i]to every man-made position of authority…Lit: in all human creature. An idiom apparently.
*[j]established through the Lord…Lit: through the Lord. It’s not clear whether this phrase means to submit 
through the Lord or that the positions of authority were created through the Lord. I’m guessing it’s the 
latter, and that this somehow extends the idiom.
*[k]band of fellow believers…Lit: the brotherhood
*[l]I assume you are but if not you should be submitting…Lit: submitting. For the next several verses and 
into chapter 3, Peter uses participles in place of imperative verb forms, while the reader understands 
that the imperative form is meant. By using the participle, Peter takes on a less accusatory posture.
*[m]abuse and reprimands—even getting slapped around…Lit: beatings [more literally buffeting or cuffs: 
multiple hits with a fist or with the palm of one’s hand]. The picture here is of a slave being punched or 
slapped by his master because of displeasure or disobedience.
*[n]from…Or: with
*[o]wooden cross-beam…Lit: wood. Ref. note of Acts 5:30.
*[p]the Great Leader, Overseer, and Protector…Lit: the shepherd [pastor] and overseer [bishop]. A 
hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[q]minds, emotions, our very beings…Lit: soul

*[A]logical analogy to…Lit: logical. Or: Word [of God]-related. There’s some ambiguity in what Peter means 
by the Gk. word logikos (λογικός/Strong’s 3050), the adjective that most other translations render Word. 
One could put up a substantial argument for either. Perhaps it means both.
*[B]like a newborn baby yearns for milk, yearn for the (logical analogy to the) pure milk…Lit: like a newborn 
baby, you all yearn the logical [or Word-related] pure milk This is a hybrid simile and metaphor, one of 
the most excellent metaphors in the NT. The most tremendous growth spurt that a human being 
experiences is when a one is a newborn baby between the ages of three and seven weeks. During this 
time, a baby is continuously hungry for milk, crying around the clock to be fed. A baby grows 
substantially during this four week period. Peter is telling Christians to mimic the hunger which a 
newborn baby has; he is not telling them to imitate babies in any other respect. Just as this baby 
hungers, is fed, and grows enormously, is the same way should Christians hunger for the Word. Their 
growth will be like the baby’s.
*[C]since—surely now—…Lit: if. The rendering of this word [ei, (εἰ/Strong’s 1487)] has caused confusion to 
the point that several ancient manuscripts have altered this word from ei to eiper (εἰπερ/no Strong’s 
word) forcing it to say since instead of if. There are secondary meanings to the word ei that Peter is likely 
drawing on here, but nevertheless some ambiguity remains.
*[D]A stone which causes one to veer off into a ditch resulting in wrong-doing and also a rock which 
offends…Lit: a stumbling stone and a rock of stumbling [or, offense]. Liberties taken. The word stumbling 
is an idiom; ref. note of Matt. 11:6.
*[E]they slander you as being a bad person (etc.)…What Peter is saying here in v. 12 is that although non-
Christians will slander you simply because of prejudice, stereotypes, rumors, lies, misunderstandings, 
etc., when they’re pressed to get down to the brass tacks and look at the specific circumstances about 
someone they know who’s a Christian, they’ll have to (or perhaps will reluctantly) admit that, based on 
that Christian’s good behavior in the specific situations he was observed in, he is a decent person after 
all.
[F]submit…The Gk. word here for submit [hupotassō, (ὑποτάσσω/Strong’s 5293)] literally means to 
arrange oneself under. There are multiple words in the NT which essentially mean to order, to give a 
command, etc. The stem from which the word arrange comes means to given an order, and it was a 
military term used when a commander issued orders to deploy units of phalanxes, etc. on a battlefield. 
A good arrangement of the units, and one which was carried out successfully, was crucial to victory on 
the battlefield. So hupotassō means to allow oneself to be “arranged” by the person in command, 
knowing that the one in command has the overall view of what needs to be put and where and is placing 
you in position according to a master plan—a plan which you might not even be familiar with. This shade 
of meaning to the word submit differs from a shade of meaning of an underling being crushed by an 
oppressive overlord.
In this regard, the Gk. word hypakouō (ὑπακούω/Strong’s 5219), which corresponds to obey, literally 
means under the giving-ear-to. This refers to being under the audible sound—the voice commands—of 
another person. The nature of the word is that one person is to simply obey the spoken-orders (and this 
would apply to any order, not just a spoken one) of the one above him. The emphasis is on simple 
obedience to the order, without questions asked and without an expectation that the one obeying will 
understand the big-picture. And this is where submit and obey diverge. The one who submits 
understands that his submission is necessary to accomplish the overall goal; that he should understand 
the overall goal and understand that he is one of multiple parties, all of whom must do his part and 
comply with his specific command for the sake of the overall strategy, vision, or long-term plan, which is 
planned and executed by the one in charge. Therefore, a child or a slave is expected to obey, not submit, 
but an adult, one who has heavy responsibilities, such as a soldier, is told to submit, not obey.
Throughout history, there have been two methods whereby the common soldier takes orders from a 
superior: the soldier can submit or he can obey. Generally speaking, armies where the soldiers submit 
are more effective than armies where the soldiers obey. Those who submit are encouraged to think 
beyond their individual contribution, and because of that, a person who submits may at times improvise 
according to the need of the moment, not doing what he was directly ordered to do for the sake of the 
overarching plan. Soldiers who simply obey will fear potential retribution due to improvisation and not 
exploit opportunities or adapt to changing conditions on the battlefield.

25|You see, you were 
wandering astray like sheep, but now—now you’ve returned to the Great Leader, 
Overseer, and Protector[p] of our minds, emotions, of our very beings[q].


&PET1 3
1|Along the same lines, wives, I assume you are but if not you should be 
submitting[a] to your husbands, so that even if any one of them are disobedient, don’t 
believe, or simply aren’t convinced[A] that the Word of God is true and that they should 
obey it, they’ll be won over by their wives’ behavior[b] without you wives having to say a 
word 
2|after they observe your holy[c] conduct carried out in reverence bordering on 
fear. 
3|Your true beauty and persona, what makes you you: let it not be what’s on the 
outside (getting your hair done[d] and putting on expensive jewelry[d] or wearing stylish 
or alluring clothing[d]—what you put on to make yourself look good[B])— 
4|but instead 
let your true beauty be the heart’s hidden person—let it be in the indestructible qualities[e] 
of a gentle, restrained, quiet (in the sense of being at-rest and at-peace)[C] disposition 
and prevailing attitude[f], which is dear and precious in God’s mind when He focuses 
His attention on it[g]. 
5|This is the same way that, years ago, the holy women back then 
who hoped in God used to make themselves look good[h], submitting to their husbands, 

6|as Sarah submitted to Abraham calling him “Sir[i].” You have become her protégés[j] 
by doing good and at the same time not fearing any threats.
          
7|Along the same lines, husbands, I assume you are but if not you should be 
cohabitating with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker “vessel” (a 
“vessel” being a person whose wide range of human expression is put to use[D])—the female-
type—assigning honor and worth to her, as she too is a joint-recipient of life’s grace, so 
that your prayers not be impeded.
          
8|Now in conclusion, everyone, be harmonious (i.e. everyone be on the same 
page), sympathetic (i.e. share the pain of others), enjoy the companionship of your 
fellow-comrades, compassionate (i.e. have a tender sense of goodwill towards one 
another deep inside), and have a humble attitude, 
9|not paying back those who 
mistreat you by mistreating them, nor repaying an insult with an insult but blessing 
them (i.e. wishing them well) instead, because you were inaugurated into the Christian 
faith for this outcome[k]: so that a blessing would be yours for the keeping[l].


10|For he who wishes to love life
And see good days:
Have him halt his tongue from bad
And his lips from the utterance of guile.

11|Let him turn away from bad and do good,
Search for peace and pursue it.

12|Because the Lord’s eyes are upon the righteous,
And His ears hearken to their prayers,
But the full attention[m] of the Lord is directed
At those who do bad.

          
13|And who’ll mistreat you if you’ve become a fanatic for doing good? 

14|But even if you were to suffer on account of doing right, you’re blessed. Don’t 
be afraid of their intimidation nor be troubled by them— 
15|Instead, put Christ the 
Lord in a hallowed place in your hearts, a place away from everything else, ever ready 
to give a reply in defense to everyone who asks you about the hope in you. 

16|Don’t defend yourself with an attitude of aggression but with gentleness and 
reverence instead, maintaining a good conscience, so that in the area in which they 
badmouthed you, they would be put to shame upon observing your good conduct in 
Christ. 
17|The fact of the matter is, it’s better to suffer for doing good (if it’s God’s 
will) than for doing bad.
          
18|This is because Christ suffered with respect to sin also, the just on behalf 
of the unjust, so that he would bring us to God, having died in the flesh on the one hand 
but having been made alive in the Spirit[n] on the other.
          
19|Also, he preached in the Spirit to the spirits in prison[E], 
20|the 
people back then who were disobedient and couldn’t be convinced that a flood was 
coming back when God’s longsuffering kept on pushing out[F] the date of the flood in 
Noah’s time while he was building and provisioning the ark, an ark into which just a 
few—namely eight people—were saved (i.e. rescued from impending destruction) from 
the start through to the end of the deluge of water, 
21|which is a symbolic 
representation of how baptism saves a person in the here-and-now—not the sort of 
“baptism” which is a purification ritual whose sole purpose is to remove dirt from the body, 
but instead the sort of “baptism” which is a good conscience’s appeal to God through the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
*[a]I assume you are but if not you should be submitting…Lit: submitting. Ref. note of 2:18.
*[b]their wives’ behavior…Lit: the behavior of the wives
*[c]holy…Also: pure; chaste
*[d]getting your hair done…expensive jewelry…stylish or alluring clothing…Lit: braided hair…gold…clothing 
[outerwear]
*[e]indestructible qualities…Lit: imperishableness
*[f]disposition and prevailing attitude…Lit: spirit
*[g]in God’s mind when He focuses His attention on it…Lit: before God. An expression.
*[h]make themselves look good…Lit: adorn themselves. Same word used in v. 3.
*[i]sir…Lit: lord
*[j]her protégés…Lit: her children. A figure of speech.
*[k]you were inaugurated into the Christian faith for this outcome…Lit: unto this you were called. The word 
called in the Epistles is an expression.
*[l]yours for the keeping…Lit: inherit
*[m]full attention…Lit: face
*[n]in the Spirit…Or: by the Spirit; in spirit. The ambiguity decided by the context.
*[o]God’s chief executive…Lit: in God’s right [hand]. An expression.

*[A]disobedient, don’t believe, or simply aren’t convinced….The Gk. word apeitheō (ἀπειθέω/Strong’s 
544)means all three of these: to not be persuaded; to not believe; to be disobedient. The more common 
word for to believe is pisteuō (πιστεύω/Strong’s 4100); to not believe is apisteuō (ἀπιστέω/Strong’s 569). 
Apisteuō has connotations of stubbornly refusing to believe out of hard-hearted disobedience . Acts 
28:24 shows by example the difference between these two Gk. words. But the point of the matter is 
that Peter said that those husbands who are apeitheō will be won over—he did not say that the 
apisteuō-husbands can or will be won.
*[B]getting your hair done and putting on expensive jewelry or wearing stylish or alluring clothing…stylish 
or alluring clothing—what you put on to make yourself look good…Lit: Gk. kosmos for what you put on to 
make yourself look good. Kosmos (κόσμος/Strong’s 2889) in this context uses a secondary meaning, 
which is adornment, dress, decoration. It’s hard to imagine that this secondary definition of kosmos 
doesn’t acquire overtones from its primary definition (world/worldly), which, assuming that is the case, 
justifies the rendering stylish, cosmopolitan, and even alluring. In addition to this use of kosmos…Years 
ago, Christians who were part of the holiness movement (which includes Pentecostals) interpreted 
verses to mean that Christian women shouldn’t braid their hair, wear jewelry or wear nice clothing. This 
is not the point Peter is making. (And as Jeanne Wilkerson used to say in rebuttal to this flaky teaching, 
“If the barn needs painting, why then: paint it.”) Peter is saying that a woman shouldn’t consider herself 
to be a beautiful person because of her outward appearance but because of her inward nature.
*[C]quiet (in the sense of being at-rest and at-peace)…The Gk. word used here for quiet appears nowhere 
else in the NT. Had Peter meant a woman who doesn’t talk a lot, he would’ve used a different, more 
commonly used word which means quiet. But this verse is referring to a woman who isn’t consumed 
with drama; playing games; false suspicions of the motives of others; easily angered; prone to jealousy; 
etc.
*[D]a person whose wide range of human expression is put to use…Lit: vessel. In the NT, the word vessel 
when referring to a person and not to an actual container is a figure of speech, a metonymy and an 
idiom. Ref. Acts 9:15; Rom. 9:21; 1 Cor. 4:7; 1 Thess. 4:4; 2 Tim. 2:20. A vessel is a container that holds 
something which is worth storing; the vessel’s ability to hold and store that thing is what gives the vessel 
value. Our physical bodies are containers which hold our spirits and the Holy Spirit, and this is what gives 
our bodies value, as our bodies are animated by the Spirit inside of us. But vessels are not only bodies 
but human beings.
*[E]spirits in prison…According to the context, these are all the people on the earth except for Noah and 
his family, those who didn’t make it into the ark. The assumption is that the “prison” referred to here is 
hell and that Jesus “preached” to them when he was in hell after his death and before his resurrection. 
Perhaps Jesus was preaching to them about the fact that he was going to be rescued from that place in 
the same way that, when they were alive, Noah preached to them that he was going to be rescued from 
the flood coming on the earth. This is speculation of course.
*[F]kept on pushing out…Also: kept on postponing. Peter is saying that God was doing His best to get the 
people on the earth to repent so He wouldn’t have to send a flood, and kept on postponing the time of 
the flood to give them yet another opportunity to repent. The oldest living person recorded in the Bible 
is Methuselah, whose name means “his death shall send.” His name itself is a prophecy of the coming 
flood, and the prophecy is that when he dies the flood will come (and upon correlating the dates, the 
flood occurred the year Methuselah died). In God’s longsuffering, He postponed the date of flood, but 
also had to lengthen Methuselah’s life because of the prophecy. Methuselah’s long life is a testimony to 
God’s longsuffering.
[G]demonic agents, demon spirits with authority over other demon spirits, and evil forces…Lit: angels 
[agents] and authorities and powers. Based on a preponderance of NT teachings, this verse is talking 
about demonic spirits and not about humans. The word angels here means messengers (which is agents) 
instead of fallen angels. These agents are demonic spirits (“messengers of Satan”, 2 Cor. 12:7, NASB) 
which Satan sends to fulfill a specific mission. The word authorities refers to demons which are given 
authority over other demons, and the same word is used this way in Eph. 6:12. The word powers refers 
to demons that are simply a force for evil. Before Jesus ascended into heaven, these wicked spirits were 
made subordinate to him.

1|So seeing that Christ suffered in the flesh, you too arm yourselves (mentally 
speaking) for the same, since he who’s suffered in the flesh has stopped sins from 
happening. 
2|No longer live out the remaining days of your life for the carnal passions 
of human nature but rather live your days out in the will of God. 
3|The fact of the 
matter is, there’s been plenty of time to have acted out the yearnings of the heathen 
nations to the nth degree, having followed a course of unrestrained indulgence in 
immoral, physical pleasures (especially sexual ones)[a]; heated, passionate, over-the-top 
lusts and desires; drunkenness; wild partying; parties centered around getting drunk; 
and idolatry—which is absolutely forbidden. 
4|In regard to this, they think it’s weird 
that you don’t join them in rushing to the very same spigot which is pouring out a 
shameless, wasted lifestyle[b], and you’re vilified for it— 
5|They’ll have to cough up 
an answer for this and give it[c] to Him who’s primed and ready[d] to judge both kinds of 
people, those who are spiritually alive and those who are spiritually dead[A]. 
6|With this 
in mind, you see[e], a good-news message was evangelized to those who are spiritually 
dead, so that while—sure—in their natural lives they’re held to a standard in 
accordance to human rules and expectations[f], but on the other hand in their spiritual 
lives would live in accordance to God’s grace, plans, rules and expectations.
          
7|Paramount among all things is that the end is near, so keep your head 
screwed on tightly and control yourselves so you’ll stay in the mode of offering up 
prayers. 
8|The number-one priority is that you maintain a fervent love for the others 
among you, because love covers over a good number of sins.
          
9|Be hospitable (i.e., be open to those who are different than yourselves) to one 
another without complaint. 
10|Just as each of you received a gift from God, as 
competent and dependable stewards of the multi-faceted[g] grace of God, use it to serve 
the others among you. 
11|If someone speaks, have him speak as though he’s 
delivering a word of prophecy from God; if someone serves, have him serve out of strength 
which God provides, so that in everything God would be glorified through Jesus Christ, 
with whom is the Glory and the Might forever and ever—Amen (no more need be said).
          
12|Beloved, don’t consider the trial that is happening to you—a pressure-
cooker[h] of an ordeal—to be abnormal, as though a stranger is meeting you to join up 
with you, 
13|but instead, insofar as you are familiar with the sufferings of Christ, 
being a joint-sharer with him, rejoice, so that you too would jump for joy in the 
revelation of his glory. 
14|If you’re chewed out, scorned, discredited, or disgraced[i] 
because you’re affiliated with and follow the precepts of Christ[j], you’re blessed, because 
a spark of the glory and of the Spirit of God rests upon you. 
15|But upon closer 
examination, make sure it’s not the case that any of you[k] are suffering as a murderer, a 
thief, a villain, or as a subversive[l]. 
16|But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him 
not think to himself that he’s guilty of wrongdoing[m], but let him glorify God as one 
authorized by this God[n].
          
17|This is because the timeframe[o] is getting closer and closer for the Judgment 
to begin, a judgment starting from God’s house and extending outwards. And if it starts 
with us first, how will things turn out for those who don’t believe in the Gospel?

If the righteous man just barely squeaks by[p]
The rank-sinner[q]—what’s to come of him[r]?

          
*[a]unrestrained indulgence in immoral, physical pleasures (especially sexual ones)…Also: licentiousness; 
debauchery
*[b]shameless, wasted lifestyle…Also: dissipation
*[c]They’ll have to cough up an answer for this and give it…Lit: they will pay out a word [statement]
*[d]primed and ready…Also: fully prepared…Lit: having the readiness
*[e]With this in mind, you see…Lit: for unto this
*[f]in their natural lives they’re held to a standard in accordance to human rules and expectations, but on 
the other hand in their spiritual lives would live in accordance to God’s grace, plans, rules and 
expectations…Lit: judged in flesh according to men, but on the other hand they would live in spirit 
according to God
*[g]multi-faceted…Also: manifold
*[h]pressure-cooker…Lit: fiery. Some liberties taken.
*[i]chewed-out, scorned, discredited, or disgraced…Lit: reproached
*[j]affiliated with and follow the precepts of Christ…Lit: in the name of Christ
*[k]make sure it’s not the case that any of you…Lit: let not any of you
*[l]subversive…Also: one who practices intrigue; a revolutionary; an insurgent; one who participates in a 
conspiracy…Lit: meddler

[A]both kinds of people, those who are spiritually alive and those who are spiritually dead…Lit: living and 
dead. The lack of definite articles before living and dead emphasizes the nature of the people. The 
context is steered by the next verse, which refers to the dead who are spiritually dead rather than 
physically; therefore this verse refers to those who are spiritually alive and those who are spiritually 
dead. One assumes that the living and the dead are people who are physically dead, as NT judgment 
occurs after one dies—and this may or may not be true—but it’s not something Peter is saying explicitly.

1|So those among you who are on the church governing board[a]: as your fellow 
board member and witness of Christ’s sufferings and joint sharer of the coming glory to 
be revealed, I entreat you: 
2|Pastor (i.e. lead; be a shepherd to)[A] God’s sheep among 
you with a leadership style[B] that doesn’t force people into doing things but instead one 
which has them doing things God’s way[b]: willingly. And don’t use your leadership 
position to greedily and dishonestly increase your wealth but lead with a well-disposed, 
willing, and eager attitude instead— 
3|Not leading those assigned to you[c] as a 
domineering, micro-managing dictator[d], but leading by becoming an example of what a 
sheep should be instead. 
4|And when the Chief Pastor appears, he’ll bring you the 
unfading victor’s wreath of glory.
          
5|In the same vein, younger men: submit to the board members; and to 
everyone else: wrap around yourselves the clothing of a humble attitude, since…

God opposes the arrogant
But gives grace to the humble

          
6|So humble yourselves under God’s mighty hand—His mighty ability to 
intervene in the affairs of mankind—so that He would cause things to turn out well for 
you[e] when the time’s right[f], 
7|casting all of your cares, anxieties, and worries upon 
Him, since He’s concerned about you.
          
8|Be level-headed and stay focused[g]. Your adversary the devil saunters about 
like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour— 
9|Firmly stand against him—
firmly resist him—in the faith, knowing first-hand that the same thing is being 
perpetrated on your fellow comrades[h] in the world, in this ungodly human society. 

10|But the God of every and all grace, He who called you to His eternal glory in 
Christ, after suffering a bit, He’ll rehabilitate, restore, mend, stabilize, make you 
resolute, strengthen you, establish you, and put you on a firm foundation— 
11|To 
Him be the Power forever—Amen (no more need by said).
          
12|By means of Silvanus, a comrade[i] who is faithful to you (that’s what I 
figure), I wrote over the course of a few paragraphs[j], encouraging, counseling, 
entreating, and declaring these things to be God’s true grace—stand in and stick to the 
grace![C]. 
13|The sister-church in metaphorical Babylon (which is Rome)[D], greets you, 
and so does Mark my son[E]. 
*[a]on the church governing board…Lit: elders. Some liberties taken; ref. note of Acts 11:30.
*[b]God’s way…Lit: according to God
*[c]those assigned to you…Lit: of the portions
*[d]not leading the heirs of eternal life as a domineering, micro-managing dictator…Lit: not lording-over. 
The Gk. word for lording-over literally means lording down upon or lording to the utmost extent.
*[e]cause things to turn out well for you…Lit: exalt you. An expression; also used in Is. 14:13,14; 2 Cor. 
12:7.
*[f]when the time’s right…Lit: in season
*[g]Be level-headed and stay focused…Lit: Be sober and watch
*[h]is being perpetrated on your fellow comrades…Or: your fellow comrades are being subjected to
*[i]comrade…Lit: brother
*[j]over the course of a few paragraphs…Lit: through [the] few ones. Similar wording used in Eph. 3:3.

*[A]Pastor (i.e. lead; be a shepherd to)…Lit: shepherd. The word pastor only appears in a couple of places 
in the NT (in this verse and in Eph. 4:11); the word for pastor is the same as shepherd. The word 
shepherd in the OT refers to a leader (Ez. 37:24 is one example). The implication is that people are 
difficult to lead like sheep are difficult to lead, so the word pastor is one who faces the difficulties in 
leading people, who are by nature difficult to lead.
*[B]with a leadership style…Some of the older manuscripts include a variation of this interpolation 
explicitly in a single Gk. word [episkopountes, (ἐπισκοποῦντεσ/Strong’s 1983)] rendered exercising 
oversight; the word bishop [episkopos, (ἐπίσκοπος/Strong’s 1985)] is obviously the noun form of this 
verb. As the two principal Alexandrian manuscripts omit the word episkopountes, it is my opinion that 
this word is a spurious addition—although it fits nicely in the context. As Christianity evolved into the 
late first and early second centuries, churches governed by elder bodies were replaced by churches 
governed by a single person—a bishop. They sought to stamp out any suggestion in the NT that 
churches can or should be governed by elder boards and not by bishops; hence, the addition of the word 
episkopountes to some of the manuscripts. This controversy persists to the present day.
*[C]stand in and stick to the grace!…Lit: stand to it [“it” referring to “the grace”]!…Or: stand in it [“the 
grace”]!. The words the grace are a clarification for the reader, and this interpolation is justified by 
matching a pronoun with its antecedents by gender. The GT literally reads stand to it, but scholars argue 
that Peter actually meant stand in it. Some guesswork was used to come up with “stand in and stick to.”
*[D]The sister-church in metaphorical Babylon (which is Rome)…Lit: the fellow-called [church] in Babylon. 
The word called in fellow-called shares the same root word for church, so fellow-called is fellow-church 
or sister-church. Some Bible “experts” incorrectly render this verse she who is in Babylon (etc). This is an 
incorrect understanding of Gk. grammar, as the prepositional phrase in Babylon , inserted between the 
definite article and the noun, must be moved, leaving the definite article to couple tightly with the noun, 
rendering it the fellow-church instead of the dangling word she etc. Moving along…many scholars agree 
that Peter is speaking metaphorically when he speaks of Babylon. In the same verse, he refers to Mark 
as his son, and as this is metaphorical, it lends credence to assuming that Babylon is metaphorical as 
well.
*[E]Mark my son…Peter is referring to John-Mark, the same Mark who wrote the Gospel of Mark. Mark 
was not Peter’s actual son, but was Peter’s close companion and son in the faith. Church tradition tells 
us that Mark served as Peter’s translator, and that Mark wrote the Gospel of Mark shortly after Peter 
was executed. This Gospel is essentially a compilation of all the stories which Mark translated for Peter 
time and time again throughout the years.
[F]with hearty handshakes and warm hugs of love…Lit: with a kiss of love. Liberties taken. Kisses were 
normal greetings, and were exchanged irrespective of gender. Judas greeted Jesus with a kiss in the 
Garden of Gethsemane.


2 Peter
       2 Peter is a long, brilliantly-written diatribe against evil people and has a different flavor than 1 
Peter, and this is one reason why the authenticity of its authorship is in question. 2 Peter and Jude are 
similar books and both faced opposition when the canon was first formalized, with several dissenters 
who wanted to exclude it.
       The Greek writing style is a bit choppy in parts, but fluid overall. There is a beauty to the prose 
as it keeps on a subject while moving from point to point. The transitions are smooth, the verses are 
sprinkled with metaphors. Overall, the book is as enjoyable to translate as it is to read. It’s a pity that 
this translation squashes beautiful figures of speech such as found in 2:9 which in the Greek text literally 
reads, “the Lord knows to rescue the pious”; the figure of speech means that the Lord has a long history 
of rescuing the pious and will certainly continue to do so.
       This epistle has many vocabulary words not found elsewhere in the NT. Between this and the 
fact that it has not received the attention and scholarship that the more popular NT books have received 
makes it more difficult to resolve the meaning of certain words, an example being 2:17 where the word 
“mist” is assumed to be “drizzle.”
       The assertion that the author makes in 3:16, namely that he considers Paul’s epistles to be on 
par with Scripture, is a view which didn’t evolve until later; when writing his epistles, Paul didn’t believe 
he was penning Scripture.
       The author goes out of his way to assure us that this letter is in fact the second epistle (3:1), but 
giving that assurance is not reassuring: the letter smells like a fraud—howbeit, a well-written one. The 
epistle expends too much vitriol railing against the corrupt and too little encouraging believers, which 
doesn’t help its case. And perhaps it is this vitriol which caused a writer other than Peter to lie and claim 
to be him. We’ll never know.

1|Simon Peter, servant and missionary[a] of Jesus Christ:
      To you who received (because you had the good fortune to have God smile on you) an 
equivalent-status faith as ours in the righteousness of our God and savior Jesus Christ:
          
2|May grace and peace flourish in the recognition and precise understanding 
of our God and of Jesus our Lord, 
3|as all things having their origin in His divine 
power, the things associated with life and piety, have been bestowed upon us all 
through the recognition and understanding of Him who called us by means of His own 
glory and virtue. 
4|Through this glory and virtue He has given the valuable, absolute-
greatest promises to us, so that through them you shoulder-to-shoulder participants 
would become partakers of His divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is 
with the strong desires and lustful passions in the world-system which humans created.
          
5|And for this very reason, get all over it[b] and supply the moral virtue which is 
dearly needed in the application of your faith, and the knowledge which is needed in the 
moral virtue, 
6|and the self-control needed in the knowledge, and the endurance needed 
in the self-control, and the piety in the endurance, 
7|and the close friendship with 
your fellow man[c] in the piety, and the love in the close friendship with your fellow 
man. 
8|In fact, while these things exist in you and increase—as opposed to being idle 
or unproductive—they constitute coming to the knowledge and understanding of our 
Lord Jesus Christ.
          
9|When you get right down to it, the one who hasn’t gotten this[d] is blind, not 
being able to see the big picture, oblivious to[e] the cleansing of the sins that he 
committed long ago. 
10|All the more reason, comrades[f], to get on it and make sure 
your Christian walk is tied down[g]; you see, by doing this, there’s no way at all that 
you’ll ever get off-track. 
11|The fact is, this is the way that the access into the 
eternal kingdom (i.e., God’s involvement in our lives) of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 
will be abundantly supplied to you.
          
12|Therefore I intend to constantly remind you of these things, although 
you’ve reached the point where you have firsthand knowledge and are established in 
the truth which is right in front of you. 
13|But I consider it to be the right thing to 
do, to stir you up by giving you copious reminders for as long as I’m in this physical 
container of a body[h], 
14|seeing that the laying aside of my body is imminent, just 
as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. 
15|Now I’ll urgently be about the 
business of[i] having you constantly keep these memories alive after I depart from this life.
          
16|You see, we weren’t copying crafty, cunning myths when we made 
known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we happened to be 
eye-witnesses of that magnificence instead, 
17|seeing that he received honor and 
glory from God the Father in such majestic-sounding words delivered to him by the 
Magnificent Glory, “This is My Beloved Son, with whom I’ve been very pleased.” 

18|From out of the sky we heard the sounds of those words, after being brought up 
the holy mountain with him. 
          
19|We have the prophetic word which is more definite. You’d better pay 
attention to it like using a lamp to shine in a dark place until daylight shines through at 
daybreak and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
20|Understand this first and 
foremost: every prophecy of Scripture did not come into being from a single 
individual’s explanation of what he assumed God was saying; 
*[a]missionary…Lit: apostle
*[b]get all over it…Lit: having brought to bear all haste. The author uses the word hurry as an expression, 
here and also in vv. 10, 15.
*[c]close friendship with your fellow man…Also: brotherly love
*[d]the one who hasn’t gotten this…Lit: whom these things have not arrived to
*[e]oblivious to…Lit: having taken a forgetfulness of
*[f]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[g]make sure your Christian walk is tied down…Lit: your calling and selection are secure
*[h]physical container of a body…Lit: tent; tabernacle. The NT uses the word tent to mean physical body as 
an expression.

1|Now just as false prophets appeared out of nowhere from among the Israeli 
folk-people, there’ll also be false teachers that appear among you, ones in particular who 
subtly introduce destructive philosophies[a] along with factions who adhere to them, 
even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing swift-and-sure destruction upon 
themselves. 
2|Many will subscribe and adhere to their debauchery, subscribing to those 
through whom the Way of Truth will be smeared[b]. 
3|They’ll engage[c] you in a 
voraciousness of fabricated suppositions—their verdict has been decided for a long time 
now, and their destruction isn’t snoozing.
          
4|The fact of the matter is, if God didn’t spare angels who sinned[A], but instead 
consigned them to the torture chamber in the pit of hell[B], bound in chains of gloom, to 
be held in custody there until their sentence is handed down; 
5|and if He didn’t spare 
those who lived in the antediluvian world[d], but instead only spared eight (He guarded 
over and protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness), having sent a flood to the 
debauchery-permeated civilization[e]; 
6|and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and 
Gomorrah to ruin and scorched them to the ground, having put an example in place, in 
plain sight for all people present and future to see and take note of[f], of what He intends to do 
to the ungodly; 
7|and if He rescued Lot-the-righteous who was worn out by the 
lifestyle of the ungodly, one characterized by licentiousness— 
8|Speaking of which, the 
sights and sounds that that righteous man had to endure day in, day out; a righteous soul 
living among them, having to put up with their out-of-control, immoral freak-show[g]— 

9|The Lord has a long, consistent track record of[h] rescuing the godly from 
difficulties[i], but on the other hand a long, consistent track record of locking up and 
punishing the unrighteous until judgment day is reached— 
10|but most of all 
locking up those who walk in such a way that they follow the lead set by the carnal 
nature[j] with its polluted desires and locking up those who despise things pertaining to 
authority structures.
      Insolent, arrogant—they don’t tremble with fear while trash-talking[k] the 
sacrosanct[l], 
11|whereas angels, which are stronger and have more capabilities, 
don’t rain an invective judgment from the Lord down on them when they trash-talk like 
this. 
12|But these people, as though they have a nature like they’ve been spawned 
from ridiculous creatures resulting in their being enthralled to decadence[m], with their 
ignorant trash-talking—And in their decadence they’ll experience the destructive ends 
brought on by their decadence; 
13|acting the wrong way, they’ll pay for their 
wrong-doing—They consider it a pleasure to revel in daylight, stains and pimples 
delighting in their tricks and deceptions while they join you in feasts, 
14|their 
attention fixated on nothing but[n] adultery and a non-stop list of sins, luring unstable 
souls, having a heart that’s been conditioned to be covetousness, accursed children— 

15|Forsaking the straight-and-narrow, they were led astray, imitating the way of 
Balaam son of Bezer, who loved unrighteousness’s wage. 
16|He got a rebuke for 
his wrong-doing: a donkey who can’t talk uttered something in a human voice and 
brought the prophet’s insanity to a halt.
          
17|These people are springs which have dried up and are drizzle driven by 
a hurricane, in whom the gloom of darkness has been retained. 
18|You see, 
uttering vanity’s arrogance, using the carnal nature’s licentious desires, they lure those 
who barely escape from those who live a lifestyle of deception— 
19|they are 
promised freedom, but they exist as slaves of decadence: the fact of the matter is, 
whatever thing a person’s been defeated by, he’s enslaved to. 
20|For if they escape 
the world’s corruption by means of a recognition and precise understanding of the Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, but have become entangled and defeated again by these things 
that I’m writing about, they wind up in the situation where their final condition is worse 
than their original. 
21|In fact, they would be better off to have never recognized 
and understood the way of righteousness than, after recognizing and understanding it, 
to then, out of their betrayal, turn their back on the holy commandments.

1|At this time I’m writing this second letter to you, beloved, in which letters I 
thoroughly rouse your pure mind by giving you reminders, 
2|to remember the 
collection of previously-spoken statements made by the holy prophets and to remember 
our pioneering founders the apostles’ commandment which came from the Lord and 
Savior.
          
3|Firstmost, understand this: those who get a tremendous kick out of 
ridiculing[a] will come at a critical juncture in time[b], going about according to their 
whims 
4|saying:
      “Where is the fulfillment of the promise of His coming[A]? The fact is, starting from 
when it all began in ancient times, our ancestors have died and gone to their eternal glory 
and the promise of His coming was not fulfilled in their lifetime, and everything’s continued 
following this same pattern with no interruption from ancient times onwards.[c]”
          
5|You see, what the ones who’re deliberately ignoring this are just not getting 
is that the sky, the upper atmosphere, and outer-space[d] have existed for a long time 
now, and that the landmasses were assembled out of water and by means of water 
through the word of God, 
6|through which the world-back-then was flooded and 
destroyed. 
7|At the present time, the sky, the upper atmosphere, outer-space, and the 
earth have been kept in a holding pattern[e] by the same word of God with an end-goal of 
a judgment day and a consequent destruction of all of the ungodly people.
          
8|Now, make sure you get this, beloved: to the Lord, one day is like a thousand 
years and a thousand years is like one day. 
9|The Lord isn’t procrastinating in 
keeping His word[f], like some consider Him to be procrastinating, but He’s exercising 
patience in regard to you instead, not wishing anyone to be destroyed but leaving space 
for everyone to have a change of heart and of ways[g] instead.
          
10|The day that the Lord will arrive like a thief coming at night to steal, in 
which day the sky, the upper atmosphere, and outer-space as we know them will end[h] 
in a rushing sound, but the elements[B], as they are heated to an extremely high 
temperature, will be shattered into pieces, and the earth and what was created from it 
will be sought out, discovered, and destroyed[C]. 
11|While all these things are 
shattered into pieces this way, the sort of lifestyle you must maintain is one of holiness 
and piety, 
12|eagerly awaiting for and hastening the Day of God, by means of 
which the sky, the upper atmosphere, and outer-space will be shattered into pieces 
while burning, and the elements will be melted while being heated to an extremely high 
temperature. 
13|We eagerly await a new sky, upper atmosphere, and outer-space, 
and a new earth according to His promise, where in these new things righteousness 
dwells.
          
14|Therefore, beloved, while eagerly awaiting these things, accelerate being 
found spotless and blameless in him in peace. 
15|Consider our Lord to be the 
patient savior, just as our beloved comrade Paul wrote to you too, according to the 
wisdom that’s been bestowed on him, 
16|as he too talks about all these things in 
his letters, in which letters some things are difficult to understand, things that the 
unlearned and unstable distort to their own self-destruction, like they do with the rest 
of the Scriptures. 
17|So you, beloved, aware of this beforehand, protect yourselves 
so that you won’t be deceived by unprincipled men, to be led away from and ultimately 
fall from your individual steadfastness.

1 John
       The epistle of 1 John repeats several phrases from the talks Jesus had at the Last Supper and 
shortly after, chapters 14–17. Since a large percentage of the Gospel of John consists of the last couple 
of weeks of Jesus’s life, namely the Last Supper, John was profoundly moved by it and repeated it in 1 
John.
       1 John is enigmatic, and appears at times to contradict itself. John presents things in binary 
form, in diametrically opposed qualities: love vs. hate, light vs. darkness, sin vs. righteousness. Like his 
Gospel, many of the words he prefers take on their own peculiar meanings, words such as receive, 
witness, dwell, children, fathers. To appreciate this epistle, the reader must approach it from a different 
perspective than the other epistles, one that’s less cerebral and more spiritual. Naturally, this is the very 
aspect which many have come to love, as this epistle has endeared itself into their hearts.
       The Greek text is perhaps the simplest in the NT; this is the preferred first non-textbook reading 
assignment for the novice Greek student. John intentionally uses a small set of words and simple 
grammatical constructs. It comes across the same way in the rendered text.

1|That which was from day-one, that which we’ve heard, that which we’ve 
seen with our eyes, that which we’ve beheld and our hands handled concerning the 
word of life— 
2|And the life was manifested, and we have beheld it and give an 
official report[a] about it: we announce to you the Eternal Life (i.e. that special fullness of 
life) which was with the Father and was manifested to us. 
3|That which we’ve beheld 
and heard, we announce even to you, so that you would have fellowship with us, but 
also that Our Fellowship would be with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 

4|We’re writing these things to you so that your joy would attain its greatest extent.
          
5|This is the very announcement which we heard from him and announce to 
you, that God is light and there is not a single bit of darkness in Him. 
6|If we were to 
say that we have fellowship with Him and conduct our lives[b] in the darkness, we would 
be lying and not practicing the truth. 
7|But if we were to conduct our lives in the light 
just as He is in the light, we would have fellowship with one another, and the blood of 
His son Jesus would cleanse[c] us from all sins. 
8|If we were to say on a given occasion 
that we don’t have sin, we would be fooling ourselves and the truth would not be[d] in 
us. 
9|If we were to confess our sins, He’s faithful and always does the right thing so 
that He would forgive us of our sins and would cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

10|If we were to say on a given occasion that we’ve reached the point where we

thought) is not in us.


&JOHN1 2
1|My children, I’m writing these things to you so that you wouldn’t sin. But if 
someone were to sin, we have a Helper with the Father, righteous Jesus Christ. 
2|And 
he is, by nature, the means of appeasement where our sin is concerned; not just where 
our sin is concerned only but also where the sin of the entire world, the established 
order of humans, is concerned. 
3|If we were to keep His commandments, by this 
know that we have come to know and understand Him. 
4|The one who says, “I’ve 
come to know and understand Him,” but isn’t keeping His commandments: he’s a liar, 
and the truth is not in him. 
5|But on the other hand, if one were to keep His word, His 
system of thought, by doing this the love of God has truly been brought to perfection. By 
this we know and understand that we are in Him. 
6|The one who’s making 
statements claiming to be dwelling in Him—that person is obligated to go through a 
tour of conduct[a] accordingly and that very person is obligated to be conducting his 
life[a] in that manner.
          
7|Beloved, I’m not writing to you a new, never-heard-of-before commandment, 
but rather an old commandment, one which you’ve had continually from day-one. The 
Old Commandment is the train of thought which you’ve heard. 
8|But that being said, 
I’m writing to you a new, never-heard-of-before commandment, one which is true in 
Him and in you, that the darkness is waning[b] and the True Light is already shining. 

9|The one who’s making statements claiming to be in the light but hates his comrade[c] 
has been in the darkness all this time. 
10|The one who loves his comrade dwells in 
the light, and there’s no cause for him to do wrong, be it intentional or unintentional. 

11|The one who hates his comrade is in the darkness, and he conducts his life[a] in 
the darkness and with it too. He has no direct knowledge of where he’s headed, since 
the darkness has made him go blind.


12|I’m writing to you, children,
Because your sins have been forgiven
On account of His reputation and everything He stands for[d].


13|I’m writing to you, fathers, because, since day-one,
You’ve arrived at the point
Where you know and understand Him.

I’m writing to you, aspiring young adults,
Because you’ve defeated the Evil One.


14|I wrote to you, you boys who work[A],
Because you’ve come to know the Father.

I wrote to you, fathers, because, since day-one,
You’ve arrived at the point where
You know and understand Him[B].

I wrote to you, aspiring young adults,
Because you’re strong,
And the word of God dwells in you,
And you’ve defeated the Evil One[B].

          
15|Do not love the world, the established order of humans, nor those things 
in the world. If someone were to love the world, the Father’s love is not in him, 

16|because everything that is in the world—the desires of the body’s carnal 
nature[e], the desires of what one longs for but doesn’t have[f], and the boastful, 
ostentatious swagger rooted in the material things of life—isn’t from the Father but 
instead is from the world. 
17|And the world-system is waning[b], but he who’s 
doing the will of God abides forever.
          
18|You boys who work[A]: it’s the endgame[g], and just as you heard that one 
who’s nature is of an antichrist is coming, by now many antichrists have come into 
being. Coming from that perspective, we know and understand that it’s the endgame. 

19|They left our crowd, but—no—they weren’t a part of us. You see, if they were a 
part of us, they would’ve remained with us. But—no—they left us in order that it would 
be made apparent that not everyone is one of us.
          
20|You have a special dispensation bestowed on you[C] from the Holy Spirit, 
and you know everything directly. 
21|I didn’t write to you because you don’t have 
a first-hand knowledge of the truth, but rather because you have a first-hand 
knowledge of the truth, and because every single lie does not originate from the truth. 

22|Who is the quintessential liar, except for the denier who denies that Jesus is the 
Messiah, the Christ? This guy is the Antichrist, the denier who denies the Father and the 
son. 
23|All deniers who deny the son don’t have the Father either. 
24|Let what 
you’ve heard from day-one dwell in you. If what you’ve heard from day-one were to 
dwell in you, you too will dwell in the son and in the Father. 
25|And this very 
thing is the promise which was promised to us: that special fullness of life, Eternal Life.
          
26|I wrote these things to you about those who are deceiving you and 
thereby leading you astray. 
27|And you—the special dispensation[C] that you 
received from Him dwells in you, and you have no need that someone instruct you—
no, as the very same special dispensation[C] instructs you about everything and 
anything, and is true and—just to be clear—is not a lie[h], dwell in Him in the same way 
that it, the special dispensation, has instructed you.
          
28|At this time, children, dwell in him, so that if he were to appear, we 
would have bold confidence and would not be put to shame at his public appearance.

anointing a person marks that person with extraordinary abilities, abilities which originate from God and 
are actuated by means of the Holy Spirit (are a manifestation of the Holy Spirit). These special abilities 
are specific to that one person and are for a particular purpose. In this context of 1 John 2, John’s usage 
of the word anointing is an extraordinary ability bestowed on each believer, but like any anointing, the 
extraordinary ability is unique to that person; no other person receives the same anointing. The 1 John 2 
anointing is the ability to understand how exactly one should conduct himself in a godly manner on a 
day-to-day basis. The 1 John 2 anointing gives a person the ability to discern for himself what the correct 
thing is for him to do in life. Incidentally, this passage here refutes the notion that any church leader 
(especially a cult leader) should be deciding what an individual church member should do in their 
circumstances of life, especially to a fine detail.

29|If you’ve come to know for a fact that he’s righteous, you know and understand 
that everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten from Him and by 
Him.


&JOHN1 3
1|Look at the kind of love that the Father has given us, that we would be called 
God’s children—and we are. Because of this, the world, the established order of 
humans, doesn’t know and understand us, since it didn’t know and understand Him. 

2|Beloved, at the present time we are God’s children, and it hasn’t yet been made 
apparent what we’ll be. We know that if he were to be manifested, we would be just 
like him, because we would[a] see him the way he is. 
3|And everyone who has this 
hope, a hope which is focused on him, purges himself from defilement[A] in the same 
way that he has no defilement.
          
4|Everyone who practices archetypical sin[b] also practices archetypical 
lawlessness, that is, the refusal to be restrained by the rules of God or of man. and the 
archetypical sin IS the archetypical lawlessness. 
5|And we know for a fact that that 
person appeared in order to take away the archetypical sins, and there is no sin in him. 

6|Everyone who’s dwelling in him isn’t sinning[c]; everyone who’s sinning has not 
seen him nor has come to know and understand him. 
7|Children, let no one deceive 
you and lead you astray: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, in the same 
way that That Person is righteous. 
8|The one who practices sin is from the devil, since 
he’s been sinning[d] from day-one. The Son of God appeared for this reason, so that he 
would break up and disperse the works of the devil. 
9|Everyone who’s begotten from 
and by God doesn’t practice sin, since His DNA[e] dwells in him, and he can’t sin on an 
ongoing basis[f], since he’s begotten from and by God. 
10|God’s children and the 
devil’s children are apparent by this: everyone who’s not practicing righteousness is not 
from God, and so is the one who isn’t loving his comrades[g], 
11|because this is the 
very announcement which you heard from day-one: that you would love one another— 

12|and not act in in the same manner as Cain, who was from the Evil One, and slew 
his brother. And what satisfaction and delight did he get by slaying him? He did it 
because his works were evil whereas his brother’s were righteous. 
13|Don’t be 
amazed, comrades, if the world hates you. 
14|We know for a fact that we have 
been relocated out of the state of death into the state of life, because we love the 
comrades. He who doesn’t love dwells in the state of death. 
15|Everyone who hates 
his comrade on an ongoing basis is a murderer, and you know for a fact that all 
murderers don’t have that special fullness of life—eternal life—dwelling in him. 

16|By this we have come to know and understand the love that comes from God, 
because that person put his life on the line and, indeed, laid it down[h], and we are 
obligated to put our lives on the line on behalf of the comrades. 
17|But if said 
person were to be in possession of life-sustaining goods and see his comrade in need 
and were to close off his inner, heart-felt compassion from him, how does God’s love 
dwell in him? 
18|Children, let us not love in concept[i] nor in speech but rather in 
activity and in truth.
          
19|By this we know and understand that we are part of the truth, and 
reassure our hearts before Him in His very presence, 
20|that if our heart were to 
condemn us by the guilt of introspection[B], since God is greater than our heart and 
knows and understands everything. 
21|Beloved, if our heart were to not condemn 
us by the guilt of introspection, we have confidence towards God, 
22|and that 
which we were to ask for we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments 
and we do those things before Him, in His very presence, which are pleasing to Him. 

23|And this very thing is His commandment, that we would believe in the 
reputation and vested authority[j] of His son Jesus Christ and that we would love one 
another, in the same way He commanded us to do so. 
*[a]would…Lit: will
*[b]archetypical sin…Lit: the sin. Same article-plus-word-pair used in John 8:34.

*[d]he’s been sinning…Lit: he sins
*[e]DNA…Lit: sperm
*[f]sin on an ongoing basis…Lit: sin. The verb tense for sin implies continuous action, as opposed to one-
time action.
*[g]comrades…Lit: brothers
*[h]put his life on the line and, indeed, laid it down…Same expression used in John 10:11; ref. note there.

*[A]purges himself from defilement…A metaphor comparing a NT believer’s purging of sin with the 
mandates in the OT Law of Moses concerning clean and unclean
[B]condemn us by the guilt of introspection…Lit: condemn. The Gk. word kataginōskō 
(καταγινώσκω/Strong’s 2607) used for condemn here (and is only used three times in the NT, two of 
them in this passage) is different than katakrinō (κατακρίνω/Strong’s 2632), the Gk. word normally used 
for condemn. The meaning derived from kataginōskō’s roots is to know by inference + down [where 
down means in opposition to; against; a negative or oppressive action]. Compare this to katakrinō, 
which is condemnation rendered as a verdict by a deliberative body, that is, an impartial, external party.

&JOHN1 4
1|Beloved, don’t believe in every spirit, but instead examine the spirits to see if 
they are from God and accept or reject them accordingly, because many false prophets 
have ventured out into the world, the established order of humans. 
2|You’ll know if 
you’re dealing with the Spirit of God or not by this: all spirits who confess that Jesus 
Christ has come to the earth in actual flesh and blood[a] are from God, 
3|and all spirits 
not confessing Jesus Christ and his having come in the flesh are not from God. And this is 
the spirit of the archetypical antichrist, that which you’ve heard is coming to the world, 
and by this time is already in the world. 
4|You are from God, children, and have 
defeated them, since greater is the one in you than the one in the world. 
5|They are 
from the world; for this reason they speak as belonging to the world, and the world 
listens to them. 
6|You are from God. He who knows and understands God listens to 
portions of the things we say; said person who is not from God won’t listen to any part 
of what we have to say. By this we know, understand, and recognize the pervasive 
aura[A] of truth and the pervasive aura of error.
          
7|Beloved, let us love one another, since the Christian love is from God, and all 
who love have been begotten by and from God and know and understand God. 
8|The 
one who isn’t in the habit of loving didn’t ever know and understand God, since God is 
love. 
9|The love of God has been made apparent in us by this, that God has sent his 
Only Begotten Son into the world in order that we could live through him. 
10|The 
Christian love is identified by this: not that we have arrived at the point where we love 
God, but that He loved us and sent His son as the means of appeasement where our sin 
is concerned. 
11|Beloved, if God loved us in this manner, we too are obligated to 
ever love one another. 
12|Nobody has reached the point where they’ve seen God 
entirely. If we were to love one another, God dwells in us and His love is in a state of 
completion.
          
13|We know and understand that we are abiding in Him and He in us by 
this: we’ll know it from the Spirit He’s given us. 
14|We have seen and we go on 
record[b] that the Father has sent the son, the savior of the world. 
15|If said person 
were to confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him and He in God. 

16|And we have come to know, to understand, and to believe the love which God 
has in us.
      God is love, and the one dwelling in the Christian love dwells in God, and God 
dwells in him; 
17|by this, the love has been brought to perfection among us. This is 
so that we would have confidence on judgment day, since just as That One is, we too 
are the same way in this world. 
18|Fear is not in or by the love of God, but rather the 
perfected love of God expels fear, since fear involves[c] punishment; and the one who 
fears has not reached a state of perfection in the love of God. 
19|We love because He 
first and foremost loved us. 
20|If someone were to say on a given occasion “I love 
God” and were to hate his comrade[d], he’s a liar; you see, the one who doesn’t love his 
comrade is a liar. The fact is, the one who doesn’t love his comrade whom he’s seen 
can’t love the God whom he hasn’t seen. 
*[a]in actual flesh and blood…Lit: in flesh
*[b]go on record…Lit: testify
*[c]involves…Lit: has
*[d]comrade…Lit: brother

[A]pervasive aura…Lit: spirit. In the Bible, the word spirit at times refers to an actual spirit-being and at 
other times refers to dominant inner attitude or a group attitude (in addition to this verse, 2 Tim. 1:7,

1|Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, has been 
begotten from God, and everyone who loves the One who does the begetting also loves 
the one who has been begotten from Him. 
2|By this we know and understand that we 
love God’s children: it’s when we love God and we practice His commandments. 

3|You see, God’s love is this very thing, that we would keep His commandments. 
And His commandments aren’t burdensome, 
4|since all those who’ve been begotten 
from God defeat the world-system. And this very thing is the victory which defeated 
the world: our faith.
          
5|So, who is the one who defeats the world, if not the one who believes that 
Jesus is the Son of God? 
6|This person—Jesus Christ—is the one who has come 
through water and blood; not by water alone but by water and by blood. And the Spirit 
is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 
7|For there are three who 
testify: 
8|the Spirit, the water, and the blood[A], and the three are contained in the 
One[a]. 
9|If we receive testimony from mankind, then God’s testimony is superior,

about His son.

himself. The one who won’t believe in God makes Him out to be a liar, because he has 
not arrived at a point where he has believed in the testimony which God has testified 
concerning His son. 
11|And this very thing is the testimony, that God gave us that 
special fullness of life, eternal life, and the life itself is in His son. 
12|Whoever has 
the son has the Father; he who doesn’t have the Son of God doesn’t have the life I’m 
talking about.
          
13|I wrote these things to you so that you’d know for a fact that you have 
eternal life; by “you” I mean those who believe in all that the Son of God stands for[b]. 

14|And this very thing is the confidence which we have with Him, that if we were 
to ask for something in accordance with His will, He listens to us. 
15|And if we 
know for sure that He listens to us in regard to the thing we asked for, we know for a 
fact that we are guaranteed to have the requests that we have asked of Him.
          
16|If someone were to see in its entirety his comrade[c] while he’s 
committing a sin, he shall ask on his behalf and He will give him life, with respect to those 
who are committing sins not resulting in spiritual death. There is a sin leading to 
spiritual death: I’m not talking about that, that he should ask on his behalf in that case. 

17|All wrong-doing is sin, but there is sin the nature of which does not result in 
spiritual death.
          
18|We know for a fact that everyone who’s been begotten from God doesn’t 
sin; rather, the one begotten from God keeps him, and the Evil One won’t touch him. 

19|We know for a fact that we are from God, and the entire world—the established 
order of humans—lies in the sphere of the Evil One. 
20|Now we know for a fact that 
the Son of God has come and has given to us an intellect so that we could know and 
understand the truth. And we are in the truth by being in His son Jesus Christ. This 
person is the true God and he is that special fullness of life, eternal life.

2 John
       In 2 John, John continues to speak in a similar way as 1 John, again confirming the supposition 
that John spoke this way all the time. John’s writing style from his first is not a one-off. But as the epistle 
is directed to a specific person and as the goal is to thwart false teaching, he breaks from his normal 
style at times to address a pressing issue.
       But the fact that he had to address false teaching reminds us of how severe the challenge of 
heresy was in the early church and how good we have it today in that respect.

&JOHN2 1
1|From the distinguished, respected gentleman[a]:
      To the Lady[b] chosen of God and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not 
just me but all who’ve come to know and understand the truth, 
2|because of the truth 
which dwells in us and with us forevermore:
          
3|Joy, mercy, and peace will be with us from the Father-God and from the 
Father’s son Jesus Christ, in truth and in love.
          
4|I rejoiced tremendously because I discovered that your children are 
conducting their lives[c] in truth, in accordance with a life-guiding commandment that we 
received from the Father. 
5|And at this time I’m asking you, Madame[b]—not like I’m 
writing a new, never-heard-of-before commandment but rather one which we’ve had 
from day-one—that we love one another. 
6|And love is this very thing, that we 
conduct our lives according to His commandment. This very thing is the 
commandment. Just as you heard it explained to you from day-one, so conduct your lives 
accordingly, 
7|because many deceivers have dispersed themselves throughout the 
world, deceivers who don’t confess Jesus Christ as having come in actual flesh and 
blood[d]: this is the archetypical deceiver and antichrist. 
8|Watch yourselves now, that 
you don’t ruin what we’ve accomplished but get paid every cent you’ve earned[e] 
instead. 
9|All who are venturing beyond accepted teaching and are not remaining in the 
doctrine of Christ do not have God. The one who remains in the teaching: this person 
has both the Father and the son. 
10|If someone comes to you and doesn’t bring this 
doctrine of Christ with him, don’t take him into a home and don’t extend a greeting to 
him which makes him welcome. 
11|You see, the one who expresses a greeting to 
him which makes him welcome aids, abets, and is a fellow-participant in his deeds, 
which are evil.
          
12|I have a lot to write to you about but decided not to on account of having 
to express my thoughts with pen and paper[f], but rather hope to appear to you in person 
and speak face-to-face, so that our joy would be filled to the fullest.

3 John
       In the epistle of 3 John, there is much less resemblance to John’s Gospel and his other two 
epistles. It’s as though it’s an off-the-cuff letter, one captured at random and preserved for posterity. 
John, the Apostle of Love, must deal with a rotten apple named Diotrephes, and he does not dodge the 
confrontation. This is an alternative glimpse into the life of love. And we are again reminded how good 
we have it in modern times in this respect, not having to deal with such trouble-makers.
       Verse 2 is one of the pillar scriptures of the prosperity message (a.k.a. the prosperity gospel). 
Oral Robert in his poverty stumbled across this verse in this oft-neglected epistle and from that moment 
taught it until he died.

&JOHN3 1
1|From the distinguished, respected gentleman[a] to the beloved Gaius, whom I 
love in truth.
          
2|Beloved, I’m praying that you prosper, be successful, and be healthy in the 
same way that your mind and emotions[b] prosper. 
3|You see, I rejoiced tremendously 
with the coming of the comrades[c] and in their giving an account of you, an account 
which is truthful insofar as you conduct your lives[d] in truth. 
4|I have no joy greater 
than hearing that my own spiritual children conduct their lives with the truth.
          
5|Beloved, you’d be acting in a faithful manner if you were to do something for 
the comrades—especially since they are strangers— 
6|the ones who gave an account of 
your love in front of the churches, which you’ll do well by sending them forth on their 
journey thoroughly rested, refreshed, and well-provisioned in a way worthy of God. 
7|You 
see, for the sake of reputation[e], they left taking nothing from the Gentiles. 
8|So we 
are obligated to receive (i.e., heartily welcome, provide room and board, and attend to 
their needs while they visit) people such as this in order that we might become fellow-
workers in the truth.
          
9|I wrote something to the church; instead of that being heeded, Diotrephes, who 
relishes being the number-one among them, didn’t receive (i.e., welcome; embrace) what 
we had to say in the letter. 
10|Because of this, if I do come, I’ll remind you of the 
things he did, shooting his mouth off saying nasty[f] things about us. And if that wasn’t 
enough, he didn’t receive the comrades either, and he prevented those who were 
planning to receive them from receiving them and kicked them out of the church.
          
11|Beloved, don’t imitate the bad that you see going on around you but imitate 
the good instead. He who does good is from God. He who does bad has not seen God.
          
12|Demetrius gave a glowing report about everyone and spoke the very 
truth[g]; we too give a good report, and you know for a fact that our report is right-on.
          
13|I have lots of things to write to you about, but don’t want to write on 
account of having to express my thoughts with pen and paper[h]. 
14|Now I hope to see 
you soon and speak to you face-to-face.

The Epistle of Jude
       This epistle written in an unambiguous, fluid, textbook-like style not only demonstrates the 
writer’s command of Greek but also shows his clarity of mind and ability to express himself throughout a 
long warning about “certain people who have infiltrated our community.” But at the bottom of the 
epistle, there is some meat for Christians to feed on, and most gravitate towards this.
       The author of this epistle writes in a style which is similar to that of 2 Peter, and the subject-
matter of both epistles is the same. In fact, some uncommon words—and even phrases—are common 
to both 2 Peter and Jude. For example: gloom (v. 6); glories (v. 8 & 2 Pet. 2:10); the specific usage of 
blasphemy (v. 9); ridiculous creature in nature (v. 10 & 2 Pet. 2:12); plus several more. Is it plausible that 
the same author wrote both epistles? The commonality of words and phrases means that, at a 
minimum, both authors were members of the same tight circle of associates.
       Verses 6 and 7 build on a theory about fallen angels which scholars believe comes from the 
Book of Enoch, which the epistle quotes in vv. 14,15, treating the source material as though it’s 
canonical. And in v. 9 he draws from an account about Moses which comes from a writing other than 
the OT, but at the same time assumes the reader is familiar with the story.
       It’s no surprise, then, that when the church fathers gathered to settle the NT canon, these two 
books were heavily contested.

Jude
15|Peace be to you. The close friends greet you. Go down the list of names 
and greet the close friends.


&JUDE 1
1|Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James:
      To the beloved in the Father-God and in Jesus Christ, those who have been 
preserved as God’s elect:
          
2|Mercy, peace, and love to you many times over.
          
3|Beloved, I’ve got to write to you—and I’m writing as quickly as possible—
about our mutual salvation, to plead with you to contend this once for the holy faith 
that was delivered to you. 
4|You see, certain[a] people have infiltrated our community, 
all of whom have already been described in Scripture as having the consequence of their 
actions result in judgment; ungodly men, transforming our God’s grace into debauchery 
and denying the one master, our Lord Jesus Christ.
          
5|Now I wish to remind you…A long time ago, as you’re well-aware, the Lord 
rescued a people from Egypt—the second time they fell into a crisis, He wiped out those 
who refused to have faith and believe; 
6|not only that but He’s imprisoned angels 
who didn’t stick to the domain which was their right to exercise authority over but 
instead abandoned their habitat, which resulted in a verdict being delivered against 
them when the scores were settled[b], leading to everlasting bonds and being oppressed by 
gloom. 
7|Like Sodom and Gomorrah and those in the surrounding cities, they were 
put on exhibit as an example of undergoing the punishment of eternal fire for having 
committed gross acts of sexual immorality in having pursued having sex with a different 
kind of physical body than their own[c] the same way those other guys (those angels) did. 

8|Nevertheless—sure—those people who also dream about having sex with different 
kinds of physical bodies defile themselves, but on top of that they also reject things 
pertaining to authority structures, and yet on top of that bad-mouth the sacrosanct[d].
          
9|Now when the archangel Michael was in the middle of an argument with the 
devil over Moses’s body[A], he didn’t dare rain an invective judgment down on him, but 
instead said, “May you be rebuked by the Lord!” 
10|Now those people indeed 
bad-mouth things which they have no direct knowledge of, those whose understanding 
has a nature like ridiculous creatures; they’re being destroyed in these matters by their 
decadence.
          
11|Woe to them because they’ve followed the same trajectory as Cain; and 
by following in the deception of Balaam, Balaam’s reward has been poured out on them; 
and by analogy in the ridiculousness of Korah’s rebellion, they were destroyed.
          
12|These are the ones who are stains in your love-feasts, irreverently[e] 
joining you in festive merry-making—self-guided, self-directed; moisture-less clouds 
that get driven past by the wind[B]; trees which yield nothing at harvest-season[f], 
absolutely and completely dead[g] and uprooted; 
13|savage ocean waves, their 
shame causing the foam that waves naturally generate; wandering stars for whom the 
gloom of darkness has been forevermore reserved.
          
14|Now Enoch, the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about them, 
saying:
       “Look at this now—the Lord came with his holy myriads 
15|to enact 
judgment against everyone and convict every living being in regard to all their ungodly 
works which they did in an ungodly way and about all the harsh[h] things which 
ungodly sinners spoke against Him.”
          
16|Those guys are grumblers, fault-finders, going here and there following 
their intense, personal desires, and their mouths speak condescendingly, flattering 
others in order to gain favors.
          
17|Now you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the 
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
18|that they kept on telling us, “At a critical 
juncture in time[i], from among the ungodly there will be mockers going around 
following their intense, personal desires.” 
19|These are the ones who cause 
division; they are naturally-minded and dominated by the mental facilities, not 
possessing the Spirit.
          
20|But you, beloved, edifying yourselves—building yourselves up—in your 
most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 
21|keep[j] yourself in the love of God 
while awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ resulting in that special fullness of 
life, eternal life.
          
22|On the one hand, have mercy on some, namely those who are in doubt, 

23|but on the other hand, grab some others and jerk them out of the fire. Now have 
mercy on these people reverently and with trepidation, hating even the shirt[k] dirtied by 
the flesh.
          
24|Now to the One who’s able to guard over you keeping you from falling 
prey to temptation or making a mistake and to present you before His glory without 
blemish with exultation,

Revelation
       The final piece of John’s portfolio of writings differs from the others. Revelation is a continuation 
of the prophesies in Genesis, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah, and the novice reader, lacking an overall 
view of the Bible, jumps into Revelation without first getting up to speed on those other books. This is 
explained in the author’s book A Path through Revelation.
       There are, however, numerous grammatical mistakes in Revelation, and this leaves one to 
wonder what the cause of these mistakes is. Can we assume that John wrote the book with the help of a 
scribe?— Scribes normally edit out such errors. In addition, it appears that John jumbles verb tenses 
throughout. This might be him seeing a vision in the present of something that will happen in the future 
as though it happened already but as though he witnessed it in real-time. Some of these mistakes are 
probably John not remembering the form of a particular verb. He does have a mastery of what the 
forms do, but Greek is convoluted. Some of the “mistakes” can be chalked up to John’s writing style, his 
peculiar figures of speech. The long note in Rev. 8:3 captures an example of such grammatical errors.
       Revelation does follow John’s propensity to utilize a smaller vocabulary than the likes of Paul, 
but the Greek text is both simple and complex at the same time. When translating it, one finds himself 
not so much following the literal meaning of the words and the nuances of the forms, but standing back 
and getting the gist of what’s being said and then putting that down. It’s as though one is listening 
closely to someone speaking to the broken-Greek, then putting the pieces together. At times, this 
becomes difficult because Revelation is so bizarre, and one doesn’t know if he’s encountering weirdness 
or John’s weakness in describing something. For example, Rev. 13:18, “it’s a man’s number”—not quite 
sure if that’s something ordinary that’s not explained well or if it’s yet another mystery of Revelation.
       John’s final book complements his other writings since it differs in style from his gospel and his 
epistles. After a close reading of the Greek text, he appears to be a strong-willed person who does things 
his own way. He’s not as loud as Mark (and Peter by extension), but isn’t one who submits to accepted 
conventions of writing like Luke. To read John’s books is to enter his world and to go to him, for he will 
not go to you.

&REV 1
1|A revelation—a revealing—by Jesus Christ of matters hidden, a revelation 
which God gave to him, to show his servants what must come to pass post-haste[a]. He 
transmitted what he saw through His angel to his servant John, 
2|who gave an official 
account of God’s discourse and of the statement[b] of Jesus Christ. 
3|Blessed be the one 
reading aloud to the congregation and the listeners in the congregation who hear the words 
of the prophecy and who keep what’s been written therein, for the time is near.
          
4|From John to the seven churches in the Roman province of Asia: grace be to 
you and peace from He Who was, Who is, and Who is to come, and from the seven 
spirits that are right in front of His throne, 
5|and from Jesus Christ, the Faithful 
Witness, the first-born from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
      To him who loved us and who by his blood detached us from our sins, 
6|and 
who made us into a kingdom, into personal attendants[A] to his Father-figure-God[c]—to 
him be the glory and the power forevermore. So be it[d].


7|Look!—he’s breaking through[e] the clouds
And every set of eyes will see him,
Even those who pierced him,
And all the tribes of the earth[B]
Upon seeing him will thump their chests in mourning

…Yes, indeed. Let it be so[d].
          
8|”I am the Alpha and the Omega…,” says the Lord God, “…the One Who 
exists, the One Who was, and the One Who’s coming: the Almighty.”
          
9|I, John, your comrade[f] and co-worker in the tribulation, kingdom, and 
perseverance in Jesus, wound up on the island[g] of Patmos because of the word of God 
and the solemn declaration of things pertaining to Jesus. 
10|I found myself in the 
Spirit[C] on a Sunday[h] and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet does when it 
sounds an alert 
11|saying, “Write down what you see in a scroll and send it to the 
seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and 
Laodicea.”
          
12|I turned around so I could be facing the voice while it was speaking to 
me. Once I turned around I saw seven golden lamps, 
13|and in the middle of the 
lamps I saw something equivalent to the ideal embodiment of a human being[i], wearing 
a long robe that went down to his feet and wearing a golden sash around his chest. 

14|His head and his hair were as white as white wool—as white as snow—and his 
eyes were like wheels of fire which turned around and around. 
15|His feet were the 
same as copper or bronze as it’s being melted in a furnace, and his voice is like a voice 
composed of a large volume of rushing water[j]. 
16|He had seven stars in his right 
hand, and from his mouth was a sharp, protruding, two-edged sword (a 4 foot/120cm 
long Thracian sword), and his face shined like the sun when it’s at its maximum 
intensity.
          
17|When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though I was dead. He put his right 
hand on me while saying, “Don’t be afraid. I’m the first and the last 
18|and the 
living one. I happened to die and—as you can see—I’m alive forever and ever, and I 
have the keys to the mysterious world of death[D]. 
19|So write what you see and 
that which is and that which is going to come to pass after these things. 
*[a]post-haste…Lit: quickly. This doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s coming soon; it means that he’ll travel 
quickly when he does come, like a thief in the night. Ref. usage of quickly with regard to travelling in 1 
Cor. 4:19.
*[b]statement of Jesus…Lit: testimony of Jesus. This phrase is repeated throughout Revelation.
*[c]Father-figure-God…Lit: God and Father. This is a hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[d]so be it…Let it be so…Lit: amen. Ref. note of Rev. 19:4.
*[e]breaking through…Lit: coming with
*[f]comrade…Lit: brother
*[g]on the island…Lit: in the island
*[h]on a Sunday…Lit: in the Lord-day
*[i]ideal embodiment of a human being…Lit: a son of man
*[j]a large volume of rushing water…Lit: many waters. Like the sound a waterfall makes.

*[A]personal attendants…Lit: priests. In this context, a priest is one who carries out the ritualistic duties 
demanded by the holy presence of the Almighty, similar to how priests in the OT had duties in the 
temple.
*[B]tribes of the earth…Using the word tribes as a metonymy for the present-day ethnic groups and 
nations; the assumption being that all ethnic groups and nations were spawned by a single, specific tribe 
at their inception, in the same as is recorded in the OT, Gen. 10 in particular.
*[C]in the Spirit…A strong presence of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3) comes upon a person, often 
accompanied by some sort of prophetic utterance.
[D]mysterious world of death…Lit: the death and the Hades. A reference to death as alluded to in the OT 
and to death as portrayed by Greek mythology. As Christians, John and those who read the revelation 
will take this as a figure of speech, as they are taught in heaven vs. hell mythology (mythology meaning 
the understanding of the components in the unseen world, not a fictitious story).

20|As far as 
the mystery of the seven stars which are in my right hand and the seven golden lamps: 
the seven stars are men who utter prophesies or deliver sermons (agents or messengers) at 
the seven churches, and the lamps are the seven churches.”

1|”Write the following to the agent in the Ephesus church:
      “The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand says, ‘From the one who 
walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps: 
2|I know your deeds and not just that 
but your toil and perseverance, and the fact that you won’t tolerate evil men. You 
scrutinize and push back against those who call themselves apostles—but aren’t—and 
discover that they’re liars. 
3|You have perseverance and endure on account of my 
reputation and everything I stand for[a], and you haven’t become worn out over it. 

4|That aside—I have an issue with you, that you’ve abandoned—divorced in fact—
your Original Love. 
5|So remember the place from where you’ve fallen, have a 
change of heart and of ways[b], and act the way you used to. If you don’t, I’m going to 
come to you and remove your lamp from its normal resting place—if you don’t have a 
change of heart and of ways.

they do as well.’

from those who consider themselves to be Jews but aren’t but instead are a group from 
Satan[d]. 
10|Don’t fear anything that you’re going to suffer. Look now—the devil is 
going to toss six of you in jail in order to put pressure on you to break you, and your 
ordeal will last for six days. Show yourself[e] to be faithful to the point of death, and I’ll 
give you the victor’s wreath of life.

13|’I know 
where you reside: it’s where the Citadel[g] of Satan is. You hold fast to my reputation 
and everything I stand for and refused to deny my faith during the days of Antipas, my 
Faithful Witness, who was killed, taken from you, where Satan resides.
          
14|”’That aside, I have a bit of an issue with you, that you have some there 
who adhere to the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to contrive and implement a 
plan that would attract and thereby lure the Israelites (and—boy—weren’t they your 
typical Israelites?) into sin[h], specifically to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit 
fornication. 
15|In the same manner, you also have some there who likewise adhere 
to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans. 
16|So have a change of heart and of ways. If you 
don’t, I’ll come in a hurry and engage you in combat using my mouth’s Thracian sword.
          
17|’”If you’re able to listen and take to heart what is said, hear what the 
Spirit is saying to the churches: I’ll give hidden manna (i.e. the bread which God sent each 
day from the sky to feed Israel) to the one who overcomes and will give him a voting 
ballot, one that casts a vote in his favor, and one that has a new name written on the 
ballot[A], one which nobody knows except for the one receiving it.’”
      
          
18|”Write the following to the agent in the Thyatira church:
      “The Son of God, the one has eyes like wheels of fire which turn around and 
around, and whose feet are the same as bronze or copper melting in a furnace, says, 

19|’I know your deeds, and the your love, your faith, that you do the right thing, 
and your perseverance, and that your deeds lately have been more abundant than the 
ones you did when first starting out. 
20|That aside, I have something against you, 
that you allow the woman Jezebel, the one who calls herself a prophetess, to do what she 
does. She teaches, deceives, and leads astray My Servants, enticing them to commit 
adultery and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
21|I gave her a certain amount of time 
to have a change of heart and of ways, and she isn’t willing to change from her ways of 
fornication. 
22|See here—I’m going to cause her to be bedfast[i], she and those 
committing adultery with her—I’ll cause them to undergo an extreme ordeal, if they 
choose not to change their ways. 
23|And her devotees[j]—I’ll cause them to die an 
awful, agonizing death[k]. And everyone in the church will put the pieces together and 
understand that I myself am the one who delves into and examines minds and hearts, 
and will pay each of you all commensurate with your deeds.
          
24|”’Now I say to you others in Thyatira, those who don’t adhere to her 
teaching, those in particular who haven’t had close, intimate relations (as they say) with 
the deep things of Satan: I won’t burden you with anything more[B]. 
25|However, 
hold fast to what you have up until I happen to arrive. 
26|And he who overcomes 
and he who is diligent to put into practice my deeds until it’s all said-and-done…

“’I’ll give him authority over the nations

27|And will shepherd (rule) them with an iron staff
As the clay pots are broken into pieces

          
28|”’As I too have received from my Father, I will give him the Early 
Morning Star (i.e. Venus as it appears at night). 
*[a]my reputation and everything I stand for…Lit: my name
*[b]a change of heart and of ways…Lit: repent
*[c]if you’re able to listen and take to heart what is said, hear what…Lit: he who has ears to hear, let him 
hear. Ref. Matt. 11:15.

*[h]to contrive and implement a plan that would attract and thereby lure the Israelites (and—boy—
weren’t they your typical Israelites?) into sin…Lit: cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel
*[i]cause her to be bedfast…Lit: cast her onto a bed. An expression.
*[j]her devotees…Lit: her children. It’s inferred from the use of the word children in 1 John, 2 John, and 3 
John that these are not her actual children.
*[k]I’ll cause them to die an awful, agonizing death…Lit: I’ll kill using death. A figure of speech.

*[A]a voting ballot, one that casts a vote in his favor, and one that has a new name written on the 
ballot…Lit: a white pebble…and upon the pebble a new name. Liberties taken. The pebble referred to by 
John is a pebble used for voting; white is a vote for a candidate and black is a vote against a candidate.
[B]I won’t burden you with anything more…Lit: I won’t toss another burden upon you. An expression, 
likely a metaphor which compares a person to a beast of burden, a pack animal which is already loaded 
with materials to carry and its master refuses to weigh it down with any more materials.

dead[a]. 
2|Get ahold of yourself and stay focused, and reestablish what hasn’t been

opens doors and nobody shuts, and shuts and nobody opens, says, 
8|‘I know your

Satan (those who consider themselves to be Jews, but aren’t, but are liars instead)—
look—I’ll make it so they’ll have to come and humble themselves before your feet, and 
they’ll understand that I love you. 
10|Since you’ve adhered to what my idea of 
perseverance is[j], I too will keep you safe from the moment of trial, which will put the

bad. 
11|I’m coming post-haste. Hold tight to what you have, so that nobody can 
take the victor’s trophy[k] from you. 
12|I’ll make him who overcomes a pillar in my 
God’s temple, and there’s no chance that he’ll ever again leave it and be forced to stay 
outside. I’ll write my God’s name upon him[C] and the name of God’s city, the new

Name.

      “The so-be-it[l], the Faithful and True Witness, the beginning of God’s creation 
says, 
15|’I know your works, that you’re neither cold nor hot. Oh, how I’d prefer 
that you were cold or hot, one or the other. 
16|The way things are, that you’re 
neither cold nor hot—you’re lukewarm—I’m going to spit you out of my mouth, 

17|because you say, “I’m rich, and I’ve reached the point where I’m rich enough 
that I don’t need anything.” But you don’t know that you’re wretched, pitiable, poor, 
blind, and naked. 
18|I recommend that you buy gold from me[D] which has been 
purified by heating it up and melting it, buy white clothing from me so that you can 
cover your body with it, and the shame caused by your nakedness won’t be publicized, 
and buy eye ointment from me to rub on your eyes so you’ll be able to see. 
19|As 
many as I happen to take a liking to, I point out their flaws and correct them the way a 
parent would a child. So be eager to have a change of heart and of ways. 
20|See 
here—I’m standing at the door and knocking. If someone happens to hear my knocking 
sound and open the door, I’ll enter on into his home and have an enjoyable dinner with 
him, and he’ll do the same with me.

with me by my throne, as I too have conquered and have overcome and was seated 
with my Father by His throne.

name that you live and you are dead

process of dying out…Lit: Become watchful and establish the remaining things that are going to die. Ref. 
Matt 24:42 for similar rendering of word watchful.

scrutiny…Lit: I have not found your works fulfilled before my God

*[k]trophy…Lit: wreath
*[l]so-be-it…Lit: amen

*[A]his Angels…Angels are affiliated with the holiness of God, and God uses them as attendants in the 
same way that priests used to attend to the temple in Jerusalem. They are bystanders, in other words, 
so they hear anything which is presented before God’s throne.
*[B]Philadelphia…The Quakers named the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania after the city this church 
was in, as they aspired to emulate this church, since the church received all praise and no censure.
*[C]I’ll write my God’s name upon him…The significance of writing a name on a person is that it puts a 
stamp of approval on a person, and additionally advertises that approval to everyone.
[D]buy gold from me…An elaborate metaphor of buying purified gold, clothing, and eye ointment from 
Jesus. The buying aspect is to allow God to do His work in one’s life, rather than for a person to attempt 
it on his own. The purified gold represents trials which are allowed in one’s life, the purpose of which is, 
in the pressure exerted by them, to remove life’s impurities. White clothing represents righteousness 
that’s received by God and not a righteousness generated out of one’s own efforts. The eye ointment 
allows one to see plainly what the issues are in one’s life, seeing what should already be obvious.

1|After all of this I looked, and—just like that—a door up in the sky had been 
opened, and the first voice I heard was speaking to me like a trumpet does when 
sounding an alert, saying, “Come up here and I’ll show you what must come to pass after 
these things.” 
2|Immediately I wound up in the Spirit and—just like that—a throne 
was situated there in the sky, and someone was sitting on the throne, 
3|and the one 
sitting looked like he was made of stone, of jasper and sardius, and a rainbow that looked 
just like emerald went around the throne. 
4|And twenty-four smaller thrones 
surrounded the one throne, and upon the smaller thrones were seated twenty-four 
elders[A] dressed in white and upon their heads were golden laurels, victors’ crowns. 

5|Out of the one throne came thunder and lightning. Seven lamps of fire burned 
before the throne, and these are the seven Spirits of God. 
6|And before the throne 
there was a glass lake like crystal.
      In the midst of the throne and around the throne were four animal-like creatures, 
with eyes all over them on the front and on the back. 
7|The first creature was like a 
lion, the second like a calf, the third had the face of a man, the fourth was like a flying 
eagle. 
8|And each one of the four creatures had six wings, and they were full of eyes 
around them and inside of them. Day and night they never stopped saying,

Holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty
Who was, Who is, Who’s coming

          
9|And when the creatures give glory, honor, and thanksgiving to the One 
seated on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever, 
10|the twenty-four 
elders fall and prostrate themselves before the One sitting on the throne and worship the 
One who lives forever and ever, and toss their wreaths before the throne saying,


*[A]elders…In the time of Jesus and for years prior to that, Israel had a national tribunal of judges known 
as the Sanhedrin over all of Israel, and there were lesser such tribunals that ruled over each city. This 
pattern of having a tribunal board is replicated in John’s vision.

11|You are worthy, our Lord God
To receive the glory, the honor, and the power

&REV 5
1|And I saw a scroll in the right hand of the of the One sitting on the throne, 
and the scroll was full of writing on both the front and back sides and was sealed shut[A] 
with seven seals. 
2|I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who’s 
worthy to break the seals and open the scroll[B]?” 
3|They kept trying to find someone 
who was able to, and they couldn’t find anyone in heaven, on the earth, nor in the 
underworld of death[a] to open the scroll or to even look at it. 
4|They proceeded to weep 
intensely since nobody was found worthy enough to open the scroll or to even look at it. 

5|But one of the elders then tells me, “Don’t cry. Look here—the lion of the tribe of 
Judah, from the shoot[b] of David, has prevailed in earning the right to break the seven 
seals and open the scroll.”
          
6|In the midst of the throne and the four creatures and in the midst of the 
elders, I saw a lamb standing there looking as though he had been slain, having seven 
horns seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God which have been sent out all over 
the planet. 
7|He came and took what was in the right hand of the One sitting on the 
throne, 
8|and when he took the scroll, the four creatures and the twenty-four elders 
fell and prostrated themselves before the lamb, each of them having a harp and a golden 
vial of incense, which are the prayers of those who are holy[c]. 
9|And they sing a new 
song saying in it,

You are worthy to take the scroll
And to break open its seals
Because you were slain and with your blood
Purchased for God those
From among every clan[d], language, culture[e], and ethnicity.

10|And you made them into a priestly kingdom[f] for our God,
And they will reign upon the earth.

          
11|I looked and heard a sound of many angels surrounding the throne and 
of the creatures and elders. There were millions and millions and billions and billions[C] 
in number, 
12|all saying in a loud voice,

Worthy is the slain lamb to receive
The power and wealth and wisdom and strength
And honor and glory and thanksgiving due him


13|I heard all of creation that’s in the sky, on the earth, below the earth, on top of 
the sea, and beneath the sea saying,

To the One sitting upon the throne and to the lamb
Be the thanksgiving, honor, glory, might
Forever and ever


*[a]in heaven, on the earth, nor in the underworld of death…Lit: in the sky [heaven] upon the earth nor 
under the earth
*[b]shoot…Lit: root
*[c]those who are holy…Or: the saints; those who’ve been set apart by God
*[d]clan…Lit: tribe. Ref. note of Rev. 1:7
*[e]culture…Or: folk-people
*[f]priestly kingdom…Lit: kingdom and priests. A hendiadys.
*[g]so be it…Lit: amen

*[A]sealed shut…The seals may have consisted of melted wax which was affixed to the scroll after it had 
been tightly rolled up. Before the wax cooled and hardened, the seal was stamped to give it an 
inscription. After the wax cooled, the scroll could not be unfurled, and the scroll thereby read, unless the 
wax was broken. Therefore, the seals served two purposes. First, they ensured that the scroll had never 
been read before. Second, the inscription was proof of the scroll was genuinely written by whomever 
claimed to have written it. Ref. note of 2 Cor. 1:22.
*[B]break the seals and open the scroll…Lit: open the scroll and break the seals. The assumption is that the 
literal wording of opening the scroll and breaking the seal is backwards, being an expression of a sort, 
and that the reader at the time would take this for granted. This is analogous to us telling a child, “Put 
on your shoes and socks,” which we don’t mean for the child to do it in that order, but to put on the 
socks first before putting on the shoes.
[C]millions and millions and billions and billions…Lit: ten-thousand ten-thousands and thousands of 
thousands. This is more of an expression than a precise numbering.

1|And I looked when the lamb broke[a] one of the seven seals, and I heard one 
of the four creatures in a voice like thunder say, “Come!” 
2|…And I looked and—like 
that—a white horse appeared, and the one mounted on it had a bow, and he had been 
given a victor’s wreath, and he went forth conquering and attempting to conquer.
          
3|When he broke the second seal, from out of the second creature I heard, 
“Come!” 
4|…And another horse, a red one, appeared, and the one mounted on it was 
granted to take the peace away from the planet, so that people will kill each other, and 
he was given a large sword.
          
5|When he broke the third seal, from out of the third creature I heard, “Come!” 
…And I looked and—like that—a black horse appeared, and the one mounted on it had a 
scale in his hand. 
6|I heard a voice in the midst of the four creatures saying, “Set the 
price of wheat at $100 per quart/950 ml and barley at $35 per quart[A], and don’t tamper 
with the prices of olive oil and wine.”
          
7|When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth creature’s voice say, 
“Come!” 
8|…And I looked and—like that—a pale horse appeared, and the one 
mounted on it is named Death and trailing just behind him is Graveyard[b]. They were 
given control of one-quarter of the Earth, to kill it by sword, by famine, by the plague, 
and by indigenous wild animals.
          
9|When the fifth seal was broken, I saw the lives of those who had been slain 
on account of the word of God and the profession of faith that they maintained, which 
was public knowledge[c], under the altar. 
10|A loud voice cried out, “Just how long, 
Holy and True Master, will You continue to refrain from delivering a verdict that will 
vindicate and avenge our blood, taking it out on Earth’s current inhabitants?” 

11|Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told that they’ll have to wait 
a bit longer yet, until the quota is filled with their fellow-servants, their comrades, and 
those who are going to be killed like they too were.
          
12|I looked when the sixth seal was broken, and a severe earthquake 
occurred, and the sun turned as black as burlap made out of hair, and the whole moon

&REV 7
1|After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, 
holding back the four winds of the earth, so that the winds couldn’t blow over the land, 
over the sea, or over any forest. 
2|And I saw another angel coming over from the East, 
where the sun rises, having the living God’s seal of approval, and he shouted to the four 
angels in a loud voice, the angels who were granted to trash the land and the sea, 

3|“Don’t trash the land, the sea, or the forests until we get to put a seal of approval 
upon the foreheads of God’s servants.” 
4|And I heard what the number of those who 
were sealed is—144,000—sealed from among all the sons of Israel:


5|From the tribe of Judah: 12,000
From the tribe of Reuben: 12,000
From the tribe of Gad: 12,000

6|From the tribe of Asher: 12,000
From the tribe of Naphtali: 12,000
From the tribe of Manasseh: 12,000

7|From the tribe of Simeon: 12,000
From the tribe of Levi: 12,000
From the tribe of Issachar: 12,000

8|From the tribe of Zebulon: 12,000
From the tribe of Joseph: 12,000
From the tribe of Benjamin: 12,000

          
9|After these things I looked and—like that—a large crowd, the size of which is 
unknown, from every ethnicity, clan, culture, and language was brought to stand before 
the throne and before the lamb, and they were clothed in white robes and had palm 
branches in their hands, 
10|and were crying out in a loud voice,

The protection we enjoy we attribute to our God
Who’s seated upon the throne
And by the lamb


11|And all the angels who were stood around the throne, the elders, and the four 
creatures fell on their faces before God and worshipped Him 
12|saying,

We heartily agree:[a]
The blessing, the glory, the wisdom, the thanksgiving,
The honor, the power, and the might
We attribute to our God forever and ever.
So be it.

          
13|One of the elders reflected upon this and said to me,
      “These people who are wearing the white robes—who are they and what are 
they all about[b]?”
          
14|I told him, “My good fellow[c], you know the answer.”
      And he told me, “These are the ones coming out of the Great Tribulation and 
who have washed their robes by bleaching them in the blood of the lamb.”


15|Because of this they are before God’s throne
In His very presence, the center of His attention
And perform a worship of religious service to Him
Day and night in His temple.
And the one sitting on the throne
Will set up camp among them[d].

16|They will not ever again hunger or thirst,
Nor will the sun beat down upon them
Nor any scorching heat,

*[a]we heartily agree…Lit: amen. Ref. note of 18:4.
*[b]what are they all about…Lit: whence they came. Ref. note of Luke 13:25.

And God has wiped every tear away from their eyes.


&REV 8
1|When he broke[a] the seventh seal, it became silent in heaven for about a half-
hour. 
2|And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were 
given to them.
          
3|Another angel who had in his possession a golden incense dispenser[b] came 
and was ushered over and made to stand[A] upon[c] the altar. He was given a lot of incense 
so that he would offer up upon[c] the golden altar that is before God incense in the form 
of the prayers of all the set-apart-people[d]. 
4|And the smoke of the incense which 
consists of the prayers of the set-apart-people went up from the hand of the angel who 
was before God. 
5|And the angel methodically and deliberately took the incense 
dispenser and filled it with some of the hot coals from the altar and flung it on the 
ground, and thunder and lightning, various sounds, and an earthquake occurred.
          
6|The seven angels who have the seven trumpets got ready to sound alerts by 
blowing the trumpets. 
7|The first one blew his trumpet and it hailed, as fire mixed in 
with blood was hurled to the earth. A third of the trees were incinerated as well as all of 
the grass which was still growing[e].
          
8|The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain 
consisting of a burning coal was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea turned into 
blood, 
9|and a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships 
were destroyed.
          
10|The third angel blew his trumpet, and a huge star burning like a torch 
fell from the sky and onto a third of the rivers and upon the springs of waters. 

11|The star’s called Bitter-Flavoring[f]: a third of the water became bitter, and many 
people died from the water, because it became poisonous due to its having been made 
bitter.
          
12|The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun, a third of the 
moon, and a third of the stars were struck, for the purpose of causing a third of them to 
go dark and causing no light to shine during the day a third of the time and likewise 
neither moonlight nor starlight a third of the time at night.
          
*[a]broke…Lit: opened
*[b]incense dispenser…Lit: censer
*[c]upon…Or: at

*[f]Bitter-Flavoring…Lit: Wormwood. This is an actual plant.
*[g]vulture…Or: eagle

*[A]ushered over and made to stand…Here in this passage are some of the brass tacks that Ray Summers 
in his book Worthy Is the Lamb claimed were grammatical mistakes. The verb stand here is in the 
passive voice but most translations, such as the NASB, translate it as active. The word give in v. 3 
translated offer up is future tense but should be subjunctive. The words the prayers is in the dative case, 
which is unexpected. In v. 5 the verb to take is in the perfect tense, but is used like it’s aorist. Some 
observations on the claim that these are grammatical errors. First, looking at John’s contributions to the 
NT as a whole and not just at Revelation individually, Revelation is the only book with these kinds of 
errors. In the grammatical incidences enumerated from this passage, it’s hard to imagine that these 
would not have been mistakes caused by ignorance of the language. Now, grammatical mistakes are 
made when someone’s careless, perhaps writing while he’s tired or writing in too much of a hurry. And 
that may be the case. But inspecting a couple of the verb forms which are listed here, the passive form 
of to stand and the perfect form of to take are less common than the expected forms. Someone who’s 
sloppy, careless, or rushed would use the more common forms instead of the less common. So what’s 
the conclusion? Perhaps John couldn’t remember some of the forms of words and knew that the reader 
would be able to figure it out. Or he understood what he was writing and deliberately chose to write it 
and these are not mistakes. This leaves a translator with the task of figuring out what he meant on a 
case-by-case basis.
[B]very high up in the sky…Lit: mid-heaven. In NT times, the sky and heaven as we know it were conflated 
into one, and there were multiple layers (many say there were seven). Progressing through these layers, 
one goes from the atmosphere surrounding us; to very high up in the sky; to where the sun and the stars 
are; then from there into the various layers of heaven, which presumably include paradise and the 
throne of God. According to such a gradation scheme, mid-heaven would be half-way through, and 
therefore very high up in the sky, perhaps even in their minds near where the stars are. Seeing that v. 13 
mentions a vulture (or perhaps an eagle), vultures (and eagles for that matter) have been known to fly 
as high as 37,000 feet/11,275 meters).

&REV 9
1|The fifth angel blew his horn, and I saw a star which had fallen and landed 
on the Earth, and he (the star) was given the key to the bottomless pit. 
2|He opened 
the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the pit, like smoke from a gigantic furnace. 
The sun was blotted out by the fumes from the smoke which came from the pit. 

3|From out of the smoke locusts went forth over the land, and they were granted 
capabilities that even scorpions don’t have. 
4|They were told not to harm the grass, 
nor any of the greenery, nor any of the trees—only to harm the people who don’t have 
God’s seal upon their foreheads. 
5|They were not granted permission to kill them, but 
instead were granted permission to torment them for five months—and the pain[a] they 
inflict is like when a scorpion stings a person. 
6|When that time comes around, people 
will wish they were dead but will not be so lucky, and they’ll feel like they’re dying but 
death is nevertheless evading them.[b]
          
7|The locusts looked like horses dressed for battle. Upon their heads was 
something like a golden cap[c]; their faces were like the face of a person; 
8|they had 
hair like a woman’s hair; their teeth were like a lion’s teeth; 
9|and they had 
breastplates like iron. The sound they made when flying sounds like a multitude of 
horses charging into battle. 
10|They have tails like scorpions with stingers in them, 
and they were given a mandate to hurt people with their tails for five months. 
11|A 
king rules over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in 
Greek is Apollyon (i.e. Destruction).
          
12|The first woe is over; look out, there’s two more woes coming!
          
13|The sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns 
of the golden altar which is before God 
14|say, “To the sixth angel who has the 
trumpet: release the four angels who are on top of[d] the Greater Euphrates River who’ve 
been restrained.” 
15|And the four angels who had been prepared for this very 
moment[e] to kill a third of mankind were released. 
16|The number of soldiers in 
the cavalry was two hundred million—that’s the number I heard. 
17|This is what 
the horses and the cavalry soldiers mounted on them looked like in the vision: they 
have red, purple, and yellow breastplates, and the horses’ hair is like a lion’s hair, and 
fire, smoke, and a sulfurous residue known as brimstone comes out of their mouths.
          
18|From these three curses one-third of mankind was killed—from the fire, 
smoke, and brimstone which comes out of their mouths; 
19|the fact is, the horses’ 
power is in their mouths and in their tails, seeing that their tails are like a snake having 
a head to inflict harm with. 
          
20|The remainder of mankind who weren’t killed by these curses didn’t 
repent either of the deeds of their hands, so that they wouldn’t worship demons and 
idols of gold, silver, and copper, those things that can neither see, hear, or walk around. 

*[a]pain…Lit: torment
*[b]people will wish they were dead but will not be so lucky, and they’ll feel like they’re dying, but death is 
nevertheless evading them…Lit: people will seek death and the will not find it, and they’ll feel like they’re 
dying and death flees from them. Two similar expressions; the repetition of both is a figure of speech.

&REV 10
1|I saw another angel, a powerful one, coming down out of the sky with a 
cloud wrapped around him[a] and a rainbow on his head. His face was like the sun, and 
his feet were like pillars of fire. 
2|In his hand was a little scroll which had been 
opened. He put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land, 
3|and cried out in a 
loud voice just like a roaring lion. When he cried out, the seven thunders spoke their 
own voices. 
4|And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to start writing it 
down, and I heard a voice from the sky say, “Record the fact that what the seven 
thunders spoke is genuine[b], but don’t write down what they said.”
          
5|The angel whom I saw standing on sea and land raised his right hand all the 
way up 
6|and swore an oath by Him who lives forever and ever, Who created the sky 
and the things in it, the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that 
there’ll be no further delay. 
7|To the contrary, it’ll take place in the timeframe[c] of the 
voice of the seventh angel, when he’s about to blow his trumpet and God’s mystery will 
be concluded[d], and it will turn out the way He proclaimed the glowing details to His 
own servants the prophets.
          
8|The voice which I heard from out of the sky proceeded to speak to me once 
again, “Go over and take the opened book which is in the hand of the angel standing on 
sea and land.” 
9|I left and went to the angel to tell him to give me the little scroll, and 
he then says to me, “Take it and eat it. It will upset your stomach[e], but will be as sweet 
as honey in your mouth.” 
10|I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it 
all up, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, it upset my 
stomach.

1|I was given a yardstick the size of a staff, while being told, “Get up and 
measure the temple of God, the altar, and the worshippers in it, 
2|but exclude the 
outer courtyard from the measurement, since it’s been given to the Gentiles[A]; the Holy 
City will be treated with utter contempt[a] for 42 months. 
3|And I will give the nod[b] to 
my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days while dressed in burlap signifying 
mourning[c].”
          
4|These individuals are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand 
before the Lord of the Earth. 
5|And if at any given moment someone wants to harm 
them, fire comes out of their mouths and devours their enemies. And if at any given 
moment someone would want to harm them, this someone must be killed in this 
manner.[B] 
6|These individuals have the authority to plug up the sky, so that it won’t 
rain over the timespan which they specify in prophesy, and they have authority over 
the waters to turn them into blood and over the land to smite the land with any kind of 
calamity, should they so desire.
          
7|When they do finish their public declaration[d], the beasts which come up out 
of the abyss will wage war with them, defeat them, and kill them. 
8|Their corpses will 
be left lying on the main boulevard of the Great City, which, from a spiritual perspective, 
is called That Worldly Land of Captivity Sodom[e], also where the Lord was crucified. 

9|And various ones from among the cultures, the clans, the languages, and the 
ethnicities will then see their corpses for three-and-a-half days and won’t be permitted to 
lay their bodies in a tomb. 
10|The inhabitants of the Earth will rejoice over them 
and be glad, and they’ll exchange gifts with one another, because this pair of prophets 
tormented the inhabitants of the Earth.
          
11|I watched events unfold.[C] After the three-and-a-half days, a spirit of life[D] 
sent from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and a tremendous sort of fear 
fell upon those watching what was happening to them. 
12|They heard a loud voice 
from out of the sky, originating from heaven, say to them, “Come up here,” and they 
went up into the sky in the cloud used to transport them, and their enemies watched 
them. 
13|Just about then, a severe earthquake occurred, a tenth of the city 
collapsed[f], seven thousand citizens[g] were killed by the earthquake, and the remainder 
became fearful and finally admitted to their guilt[h].
          
14|The second woe is over; look out—the third woe comes right on its heels!
          
15|The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and loud voices started to be heard 
in heaven saying,

The kingdom of the established order of our Lord
Has come to pass,
And of His Messiah, the Christ.
And He will reign forever and ever.

          
16|The twenty-four elders who are seated upon their thrones before God fell 
on their faces and worshipped God 
17|saying,

We thank you Lord God Almighty
Who is and Who was,
Because You have taken your Great, Miraculous Power
And have begun to reign with it.

18|And the nations became enraged,
And Your wrath came,
And with it the right time[i] for the dead to be judged
And to give to Your servants the prophets
The wage they earned
And to the set-apart-people[j]
And to the nobodies[l] and the great
Who are awestruck by who You are[k]
And to destroy those who are destroying the Earth.

*[A]exclude the outer courtyard from the measurement, since it’s been given to the Gentiles…The reason 
for measuring the temple is to confirm that it complies with God’s exacting standards of perfection, a 
prerequisite for His approval, and assuming it does, God will condescend to dwell in it. When God dwells 
in it, it will receive His protection. Now, the outer courtyard is not measured since God will not dwell in 
it, just as in the second temple at the time of Jesus Gentiles were allowed in that outer courtyard. 
Furthermore, the outer courtyard extends into the Holy City, which does not receive God’s protection. 
*[B]And if at any given moment someone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours 
their enemies. And if at any given moment someone would want to harm them, he must be killed in this 
manner…Two consecutive conditional sentences, where the conditional clauses are almost identical. The 
conditional clauses differ in the verb tense for the verb to want. The repetition of these clauses and 
sentences is a figure of speech used throughout the Bible. The shift in the verb tense of to want is a 
figure of speech called a polyptoton. The subtlety of this polyptoton is additional evidence that John’s 
weird use of verb tenses is idiomatic rather than the result of carelessness or neglect. Ref. note of 8:3.
*[C]I watched events unfold…This interpolation was inserted for the benefit of the reader, as, generally 
speaking, the verbs in subsequent passage use the past tense, whereas in the previous they were using 
the future.

1|A great portent was seen in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun[a], the moon 
under her feet, a crown with twelve stars on her head, 
2|and with a baby in her 
womb, screaming because of labor pains, the agony of giving birth. 
3|I saw another 
portent in heaven, and—out of nowhere—a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten 
horns and with ornamental headbands[b] on his head. 
4|His tail swept a third of the 
stars, dragging them until he’d completely gotten ahold of them[A], and flung them to the 
Earth.
      The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that he 
could devour the child when she gives birth. 
5|She gave birth to a son—a male-child—
who would some day shepherd (rule) every nation with an iron staff[B]. Her child was 
snatched away from her and taken to God and to His throne. 
6|The woman fled to the 
backcountry, where nobody was around, where, by God’s direction, a place in it had been 
prepared for her, so that she would be taken care of[c] for 1260 days, allowing her to 
recuperate.
          
7|A war occurred in heaven: Michael and his angels waged war with the 
dragon, and the dragon and his angels waged war against him. 
8|But he was not 
powerful enough, nor could he establish a foothold in heaven[d], 
9|and the Great 
Dragon, the Ancient Serpent, the one called “Slanderer” (i.e. “the Devil”)—yes indeed: 
Satan—the one who deceives the entire inhabited world—he was driven to the Earth, 
and his angels too were driven out with him. 
10|I heard a loud voice in heaven 
saying,

The end of our misery[e], the security, the power,
The kingdom of our God,
And the authority of His Messiah, His Christ
Starts right now,
Since our comrades’[f] accuser has been driven out,
The one who accuses them before our God day and night.

11|And they defeated him by means of the lamb’s blood
And the logic of his solemn declaration[g].
They didn’t love their life
Even to the point of death.

12|On account of this be glad:
You the sky, the atmosphere, outer space, and heaven
And those who are camped out[h] in you—
Woe to the land and sea
Because the devil’s headed your way filled with rage,
Knowing that he has only a small window of time left.

          
13|And when the dragon saw that he was driven to the Earth, he pursued 
the woman who gave birth to the man-child. 
14|The woman was given a pair of 
giant vulture[i] wings, so that she could fly to the place set aside for her in the 
backcountry, where she is taken care of three-and-a-half years[j], kept away from the 
serpent’s single-minded focus[k]. 
15|The serpent spewed water like a river from his 
mouth, going after the woman by making a torrent that would sweep her away; 

16|but the land came to the woman’s aid: the ground opened its mouth and drank 
the river up which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.

the stars. Note the present tense drags in the GT. Although drags is present tense in form, it is past 
tense in meaning; this is a figure of speech. The interpolation until he’d completely gotten ahold of them 
reflects the additional meaning that the figure of speech is communicating. Ref. note of John 1:5.
*[B]shepherd every nation with an iron staff…The metaphor of a shepherd is used throughout the Bible: a 
shepherd is a leader; someone who occupies a king-like position of authority. The staff being iron 
indicates the firmness and totality of the shepherd’s rule.

&REV 13
1|…[A]And I saw a beast come out of the sea, one who has ten horns, seven heads, and 
seven ornamental headbands[a] on his horns, and I saw the name “blasphemy” on his 
heads. 
2|The beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like bear claws, and 
his mouth was like a lion’s mouth. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and 
extensive authority. 
3|One of his heads seemed to be mortally wounded by having had 
its throat slit, but his mortal wound had been successfully treated. The whole earth was 
in total awe of the beast[b], 
4|and they worshipped the dragon because he gave the 
previously mentioned authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast saying, “Who 
can match the beast, and who can go to war with him and stand a chance against him?”
          
5|He was given a mouth to speak completely over-the-top blasphemies[c], and 
he was given authority to act for forty-two months. 
6|He opened his mouth to 
blaspheme God, to blaspheme His reputation, everything He stands for, the place He 
calls home, and those who call heaven home[d]. 
7|He was granted to wage war with 
the set-apart-people[e] and to conquer them, and he was granted authority over every 
clan, every culture, those who share a common dialect, and every ethnic group. 

8|Everyone on the planet will worship him, that is all those whose names haven’t been 
recorded in the Lamb’s Book of Life from day-one[f], the lamb who was slain.
      

9|A word to the wise is sufficient[g]:


10|If someone is destined to captivity,
To captivity he heads.
If someone is to be killed by a sword,
Killed by a sword he will.

There you have it: the perseverance and the faith of the set-apart-people.
      
          
11|I saw another beast come out of the ground, and he had two horns like a 
lamb but talks like a dragon. 
12|He exercises all the first beast’s authority under his 
supervision[h]. He makes it so that the Earth and those who inhabit it would worship the 
First Beast, the one who was healed of his mortal wound. 
13|He performs 
spectacular miracles[i], to the extent that he can even make flames come down from out of 
the sky all the way to the ground in front of people. 
14|And he deceives the 
inhabitants of the Earth by means of the miracles that were granted to him under the 
beast’s supervision, telling the inhabitants of the Earth to make a replica of the beast 
who had[j] the sword wound but lived through it.
          
15|It was granted to him to give life-essence[k] to the beast’s replica, so that 
the replica could both talk and could cause those who choose not to worship the replica 
to be killed. 
16|And he makes everyone—the nobodies[l] and the great, the rich and 
the poor, the free and the slave—have a mark put on their right hand[m] or on their 
forehead, 
17|so that any given person won’t be able to make a purchase or be able 
to sell a thing except if such person has the mark, specifically the beast’s name or the 
number of his name. 
*[a]ornamental headbands…Lit: diadems
*[b]was in total awe of the beast…Lit: was amazed after the beast. The unusual use of the word after 
indicates that the combination of words is likely an expression.
*[c]completely over-the-top blasphemies…Lit: great and blasphemies. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[d]His reputation, everything He stands for, the place He calls home, and all those who call heaven 
home…Lit: His name and His tabernacle and those who tabernacle in heaven
*[e]the set-apart-people…Or: the saints
*[f]day one…Lit: from foundation of world. An expression used throughout the NT.
*[g]a word to the wise is sufficient…Lit: if someone has an ear, let him hear. A favorite expression of Jesus.

&REV 14
1|I looked and—like that—the lamb was standing there at Mt. Zion and with 
him 144,000 who have his name and the name of his Father written upon their 
foreheads. 
2|I heard a voice from heaven, a voice like a large volume of rushing 
water[a] and like loud thunder. The voice I heard was like singing-harpists who are 
singing and playing their harps at the same time. 
3|They sing a new song before the 
throne and before the four creatures and the elders. No one was able to learn the song 
except for the 144,000, they who were purchased from the Earth. 
4|These are ones 
who haven’t defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins; these people follow 
the lamb wherever he goes; these people were purchased from mankind, cherry-picked 
from the pool of all humans and offered as the best-of-the-best[b] to God and to the 
lamb. 
5|No lie is to be found in their mouths; they are without blemish.
          
6|I saw another angel flying way, way up in the sky[c] having an eternal 
proclamation of good news to deliver to those sitting on the Earth, to every ethnicity, 
clan, language, and culture, 
7|saying in a loud voice, “Fear God and come clean with 
Him[d], since the time for His judgments has arrived. Worship the One who made the 
sky, the land, the sea, and the springs of water.”
          
8|Another angel—a second one—trailed behind saying, “Fallen! Fallen! 
Babylon the Great—the one whom all nations have drunk from her supply of wine, 
drinking of the wine of the ferocity of her fornication.”
          
9|Another angel—a third one—trailed them saying in a loud voice, “If one 
worships the beast and his replica and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand, 

10|this very person drinks from out of the wine of the wrath of God, the undiluted 
mixture[A] of wine which is in the cup of His wrath, and will be tormented by fire and 
brimstone under the scrutiny of[e] some holy angels and under the scrutiny of the lamb. 

11|The smoke of their torment billows up forever and ever, non-stop day and 
night, the torment of they who worship the beast and his replica, and of any given person 
if he were to have received the mark of his name.”
          
12|There you have it: the perseverance of the set-apart-people[f], those who 
keep God’s commandments and the faith of Jesus.
          
13|I heard a voice from out of the sky say, “Write this down: ‘Blessed be the 
dead who believe in and serve the Lord[g] who are killed from here on out. Yes indeed,’ 
says the Spirit, ‘so that they might rest from their toil. The fact is, as they parade in, their 
deeds are showcased.[B]’”
          
14|I looked, and—out of nowhere—a white cloud appeared, and seated on 
the cloud was someone who looked like a perfectly-proportioned man—the ideal man[h]—
possessing a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 
15|And 
another angel came out of the temple while crying out in a loud voice to the one sitting 
on the cloud, “Get out in the field and get to it with the sickle[i] and reap the entire field, 
because the time has come to reap it entirely, since the timing is perfect to reap the 
earth’s harvest[C].” 
16|So the man sitting on the cloud took his sickle[i] down to the 
Earth and reaped the Earth.
          
17|Another angel came out of the heavenly temple, he too having a sharp 
sickle of his own. 
18|And another angel came out of the altar, the one in control of 
the flames of the altar and in a loud voice hollered to one with the sharp sickle, “Get out 
there with your sharp sickle and gather the grapes from the vineyard of the Earth, 
because her grape clusters have ripened.” 
19|And the angel took his sickle to the 
Earth and gathered the grapes from the Earth and took them to the Great Winepress of 
God’s wrath. 
*[a]a large volume of rushing water…Lit: many waters. Ref. note of 1:15
*[b]These people were purchased from mankind, cherry-picked from the pool of all humans and offered as 
the best-of-the-best…Lit: These were purchased from mankind a first-fruit
*[c]way, way up in the sky…Lit: mid-heaven. Ref. note of 8:13
*[d]come clean with Him…Lit: give Him glory. An expression; ref. note of John 9:24.
*[e]under the scrutiny of…Lit: before
*[f]the set-apart-people…Or: the saints
*[g]who believe in and serve the Lord…Lit: in the Lord
*[h]someone who looked like a perfectly-proportioned man—the ideal man…Lit: the same as a son of man. 
Ref. note of Matt. 8:20.
*[i]Get out in the field and get to it with the sickle…took his sickle…Lit: Send your sickle [into the field to 
work]…cast his sickle. A figure of speech, as the sickle itself is not sent but the person swinging it is; the 
sickle is just a tool.
*[j]shoulder-high…Lit: up the horse’s bridle. Liberties taken.
*[k]200 miles/300 km…Lit: 1600 stadia. Ref. note of Luke 24:13.

*[A]undiluted mixture…In ancient times, wine was often times diluted with water. The metaphor has God’s 
wrath at maximum potency.
*[B]The fact is, as they parade in, their deeds are showcased…Lit: For their works follow after them. A 
metaphor to the triumphal entry of a general into a city, with the spoils of war carried behind him. Same 
metaphor used in 1 Tim. 5:24.
*[C]since the timing is perfect to reap the earth’s harvest…Lit: the harvest of the earth has dried out. Some 
liberties taken. The spring rain (the “latter rain”: ref. James 5:7, Joel 2:23, Jer. 5:24) arrives at the end of 
the growing season, and prepares the grain for harvest. After receiving the rain, the crop must dry out, 
otherwise it’ll get moldy. The moment it dries is the exact moment to harvest it.
[D]the winepress was tread outside the city…In those times, grape juice was extracted from grapes by 
putting the grapes in a vat and having the workers step on them, crushing them, causing the juice to 
seep out of the vat and into a pot or something. In the NT, something done outside the city was 
something which was dirty, messy, or disgusting and consequently should be prevented from 
contaminating the city.

&REV 15
1|I saw another portent in heaven, huge and quite a sight to see: seven angels 
with the last of the seven plagues, the last because with them God’s wrath is complete.
          
2|I saw something like a glass sea mixed with flames, and the ones who 
prevailed against the onslaught of the beast, against his replica, and against the number 
of his name standing there at the glass sea, in possession of God’s harps. 
3|They sang 
the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the lamb saying,

Great and Marvelous are Your works,
Lord God Almighty,
Righteous and true are Your ways,
King of the nations.

4|Who does not fear and reverence You
To the utmost extent,
To the point of fearing you, Lord?
Because You alone are pious
Since all the nations will come
And worship before You,
Since Your righteousness has been made manifest.

          
5|After these things, I looked and saw that the temple housing the Great 
Declaration[a] in heaven was opened, 
6|and the seven angels, the ones in possession of 
the seven plagues, left the temple clothed in clean, bright linen and with golden sashes 
wrapped around their chests. 
7|One of the four creatures gave the seven angels seven 
golden bowls that were filled to the brim, and the source they were filled from is the 
wrath of the God who lives forever and ever. 
*[a]the temple housing the Great Declaration…Lit: temple of the tabernacle of the witness

Revelation
8|The temple was filled up with smoke, 
and the source of the smoke is God’s glory and His power. No one was able to enter the 
temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels happened to finish.


&REV 16
1|I heard a loud voice coming out of the temple telling the angels, “Go forth 
and pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath onto the Earth.”
          
2|The first one departed and poured out his bowl onto the Earth, and a 
wicked-bad sore showed up on the people who have the mark of the beast and who 
worship his replica.
          
3|The second one poured out his bowl onto the sea, and it turned into blood, 
the blood like a dead person has, and all living beings in the sea died.
          
4|The third one poured out his bowl on the rivers and on the springs of water, 
and the water turned into blood. 
5|I heard the angel who affected the waters say,

You are correct
You Who is and Who was—You Who are pious,

6|Because saints’ and prophets’ blood has been spilled,
And You’ve given them blood to drink up.
They deserve it.


7|And from the altar I heard someone say,

      Yes indeed, Lord God Almighty
      True and correct are Your judgments

          
8|The fourth one poured his bowl out upon the sun, and it was granted the 
ability to scorch mankind in flames, 
9|and mankind was scorched something fierce[a]. 
They blasphemed God’s reputation and everything He stands for[b]—He who has 
control over all these plagues—and they wouldn’t have a change of heart and come 
clean with Him[c].
          
10|The fifth one poured his bowl out upon the beast’s throne, and his 
kingdom suddenly darkened, and they proceeded to bite their tongues as a result of the 
pain caused by the angel. 
11|As a result of their pain and their sores, they 
blasphemed the God of heaven, but they wouldn’t stop doing the deeds they were 
doing.
          
12|The sixth one poured out his bowl upon the Greater Euphrates River, 
and all its water dried up, in order to form the road that the kings who come from the 
East will use. 
13|And I saw three harassing, demonic spirits like frogs come out of 
the dragon’s mouth, the beast’s mouth, and the false prophet’s mouth; 
14|in fact, 
the demon spirits perform miracles[d] that go exactly to the kings of the entire inhabited 
world, to gather them to the war of the Great Day of God Almighty.


15|See here now: I’m coming like a thief.
Blessed is he who stays focused[e]
And retains his clothing
So that he won’t walk about naked
And be exposed to ridicule[f].


16|And they were gathered to the place called “Armageddon” in Hebrew.
          
17|The seventh angel poured his bowl out upon the lower atmosphere, and a 
loud voice came out of the temple saying, “It has come into being[g],” 
18|and 
thunder and lightning and strange sounds occurred, plus an earthquake occurred—a big 
one—the likes of which have never happened on the Earth before since the beginning of 
the human race—that’s how enormous it was. 
19|The Great City split into three 
parts, and the major cities of the nations fell. God wasn’t going to let Babylon the Great 
slip by and not dole out to her[h] the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath. 

20|Everyone living on an island fled, and nobody could be found up in the 
mountains[i]. 
*[a]mankind was scorched something fierce…Lit: the men were scorched a great scorch. The repetition of 
scorch is a figure of speech, emphasizing the scorching.
*[b]God’s reputation and everything He stands for…Lit: His name
*[c]they wouldn’t have a change of heart and come clean with Him…Lit: they wouldn’t repent to give him 
the glory. Give him the glory: an expression; ref. John 9:24 and note there.
*[d]miracles…Lit: signs; omens
*[e]stays focused…Lit: watches
*[f]and be exposed to ridicule…Lit: and they’d see his shame. Some liberties taken.
*[g]it has come into being…Same verb and same exact form of that verb is rendered come into being in the 
phrase nothing which has come into being in John 1:3.
*[h]God wasn’t going to let Babylon the Great slip by and not dole out to her…Lit: Babylon the Great was 
remembered before God to give her. A figure of speech.
*[i]Everyone living on any island fled, and nobody could be found up in the mountains…Lit: And all islands 
fled, and a mountain was not found. Islands is a metonymy for those living on it; same for mountains.
[j]that weighed about 75 lbs./34 kg…Lit: like a talent

Revelation
*[j]that weighed about 75 lbs./34 kg…Lit: like a talent

Revelation
21|Huge hailstones that weighed about 75 lbs/34 kg[j] rained down 
from the sky upon mankind, and as a result of the plague of hail, the human race 
blasphemed God, since the plague in and of itself was severe—really severe.


&REV 17
1|One of the seven angels who has the seven bowls came and spoke with me 
saying, “Come, I’ll show you the verdict rendered against the Great Harlot who sits 
upon many different waters, 
2|she whom the kings of the Earth fornicated with, and 
she whom the inhabitants of the Earth got drunk off the wine of her fornication.” 

3|He took me up to an uninhabited, desolate place in the Spirit. I saw a woman sitting 
on a scarlet beast, a beast plastered with blasphemous names, a woman who has seven 
heads and ten horns. 
4|The woman was clothed in the purple clothing that the wealthy 
wear and in luxurious scarlet and was adorned in gold, gemstones, and pearls and had a 
golden cup in her hand filled with abominations and with the impurity and sacrilegious 
nature[a] of her fornication. 
5|There was a name written on her forehead—a mystery: 
“Babylon the Great, the mother of fornicators and prostitutes and of the abominations 
of the Earth.” 
6|I saw the woman intoxicated from drinking the blood of the set-apart-
people[b] and the blood of those who make statements about Jesus[c].
      Upon seeing her, I was stupefied gawking at her[d]. 
7|The angel told me, “What 
are you gawking at? I’ll explain to you the mystery of the woman and the beast that’s 
bearing her, the one with the seven heads and the ten horns. 
8|The beast which you 
saw came up out of the abyss in the past, is not out of the abyss at the present, but is 
about to come up out of the abyss, and is headed to its own demise[e]. The existing 
inhabitants of the Earth who don’t have their names written in the Book of Life from the 
beginning of time[f] seeing the beast will be amazed, because the beast came up out of the 
abyss in the past, is not out of it at present, but will be showing up some time in the 
future.
          
9|Here’s something for a person who has a mind for intrigue: the seven heads 
are mountains where the woman is sitting. These are seven kings. 
10|Five have 
fallen, one still exists, the other hasn’t come into being yet, but when he does in fact come 
into being, he must remain a little while. 
11|The beast which came in the past and 
isn’t present now: it’s the eighth and comes out of the seven, and is headed to its own 
demise. 
12|The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who haven’t gotten a kingdom 
yet, but instead receive from the beast authority as kings for one hour. 
13|These 
guys have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. 

14|These guys will go to war with the lamb, and the lamb will conquer them, since 
he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and so will those with him: the called, the chosen, 
the faithful.
          
15|He then says to me, “The waters that you saw the harlot sitting on: they 
are cluster after cluster of folk-people[g], are nations, and are those who share a common 
dialect. 
16|The ten horns which you saw, and the beast included: these guys hate 
the harlot and will strip her bare and have her for lunch[h]. 
17|The fact is, God will 
cause them to willingly do[i] His purpose, and that purpose is towards one goal only: to 
give their kingdom to the beast, until such a time that God’s ideas be completed. 

*[a]impurity and sacrilegious nature…Lit: uncleanness
*[b]the set-apart-people…Or: the saints
*[c]those who make statements about Jesus…Lit: witnesses of Jesus
*[d]Seeing her, I was stupefied gawking at her…Lit: I marveled seeing her a great marvel. The repetition of 
marvel is a figure of speech.
*[e]headed to its own demise…Lit: headed to destruction
*[f]from the beginning of time…Lit: from the foundation of the world
*[g]cluster after cluster of folk-people…Lit: [folk] people and crowds. A hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[h]they will strip her bare and have her for lunch…Lit: they will make her desolate and naked too and they 
will eat her fleshes. Two expressions.
*[i]will cause them to willingly do…Lit: gave into their hearts to do. Note the past form gave is intended as 
future, not past.

[A]came up out of the abyss in the past, is not out of the abyss at the present, but is about to come up out 
of the abyss…Lit: was and is not and is about to be coming up out of the abyss. This appears to be more 
of the unpolished, error-ridden writing found throughout Revelation.

Revelation
*[A]came up out of the abyss in the past, is not out of the abyss at the present, but is about to come up out

18|And the woman which you saw is the Great City which has a kingdom built 
upon the kings of the Earth.


&REV 18
1|After these things happened, I saw another angel come down out of the sky, 
one who has great authority and power, and the Earth was illuminated by his majestic 
splendor[a]. 
2|He cried out in a loud voice,

Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!
She has become the haunt of harassing spirits[b]
And a prison of all filthy, disgusting[c] spirits
And a prison of all filthy, disgusting birds
And a prison of all filthy, disgusting beasts
And of all things people have come to hate,

3|Because all the nations have gotten drunk
On the wine of her fornication,
And the kings of the Earth have fornicated with her,
And the merchants of the Earth have gotten rich
Off the powerful allure of her revelry in luxury.


4|And I heard another voice speaking from the sky,

Come out, my people, from her
So that you don’t partner with her,
Participating in her sins,
And that you don’t receive a dose of her plagues,

5|Because her sins have piled up
All the way to the sky,
And God has remembered her wrong-doings.


6|Pay her back the way she dished it out to you,
And up the ante[d] according to her deeds.
Using the same cup she did her mixing in,
Mix a cocktail for her which is twice as concentrated[A].

7|So much as it glorified her
And made her revel in luxury,
Give such torment and mourning as that to her.

Because in her heart she tells herself,
“I’ve been awarded the status of[e] queen
And am not a destitute widow,
There’s no way at all that I’ll experience mourning”—

8|On account of this,
Her plagues will arrive in one day:
Death, mourning, and famine.
She’ll be purged thoroughly by fire
Because the Lord God is mighty
Who judges her.

          
9|The kings of the Earth will weep and thump their chests in mourning over her, 
those who fornicated with her and reveled in her luxury, when they eventually see the 
smoke of her conflagration, 
10|while standing far back because they’re terrified of 
her torment, saying,

Woe! Woe to the Great City!
The Mighty City Babylon—
Because your judgment arrived in one hour.

          
11|The merchants of the Earth will then cry and mourn over her, because no 
one will buy their inventory[f] any longer, 
12|inventory of gold, of silver, of 
gemstones, of pearls, of fine linen, of purple, of scarlet, of the fruit of the citron tree, of 
all sorts of chests made of ivory, of all sorts of chests made of expensive wood, of copper, 
of iron, of marble… 
13|and cinnamon, exotic spice plants, incense, myrrh, 
frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine wheat flour, wheat, beasts of burden, sheep, horses, 
chariots, slaves who do manual labor, slaves in general[g].


14|And the large pieces of fruit that come in late-summer
Consisting of your soul’s desire
Departed from you,
And all the sumptuous and splendid[h] things
Disintegrated right in front of you[i].
These things will no longer be found—
No—not a chance.


15|Those who trade in these things, the merchants who got rich off her, will stand 
far back because they’re terrified of her torment, 
16|saying,

Woe! Woe to the Great City!
Clothed in fine linen, in luxurious scarlet,
In the purple clothing that the wealthy wear,
And adorned in gold, in gemstones, and in pearls


17|…Because in one hour such wealth will be wiped out. And every helmsmen and 
everyone who works the docks[j] and sailors and whoever works in the boating industry 
stood far back 
18|and, upon seeing the smoke of her conflagration, shouted, “Have 
you ever seen anyone annihilated the same way as the Great City was?” 
19|Weeping 
and mourning, they poured dirt on their heads[B] and cried out,

Woe! Woe to the Great City!
Everyone who put ships out to sea got rich
Off her aggrandized worth,
Because in one hour she has been wiped out.

20|Rejoice over her, sky and heaven
And saints, apostles, and prophets,
Because the justice that we’re owed from her,
God in His judgment has applied to her.

          
21|An angel who is strong took a stone the size of a large millstone and 
slammed it into the sea saying,

In the same kind of swift, sudden, convulsive slam
As this stone was thrown
Babylon the Great City too has been slammed
And has not yet been found—not a trace.

22|And any sound of harp players
And their accompanying band of musicians
And flute players and trumpet players[C]
And every artisan from every form of art
Could not be found—even a trace—
Still holding performances in you,
And the sound of any millstone still grinding
Could not be heard in you—not even a trace,

23|And a lamp’s light
Won’t shine yet again in you—
Not a chance,
And the sound of a bride and groom together
Won’t be heard yet again in you—
Not a chance.

And this because your merchants were
The top deal-makers of the Earth,
Because in your drug-induced sprees,
All the nations have been deceived by you,
And you have led them down the primrose path.

[C]any sound of harp players and their accompanying band of musicians and flute players and trumpet 
players…In ancient Rome, harps and flutes were the principal instruments played in amphitheaters in 
front of large crowds. To put this in perspective, harps and flutes were to them what electric guitars and 
keyboards are to rock bands. Famous performers—the pop stars of their day—went from city to city and 
played in front of large crowds, and all were enchanted by their music. Trumpets were third behind 
harps and flutes in popularity.

&REV 19
1|After these things happened, I heard what sounded like the voice of an 
enormous crowd in heaven saying,

Hallelujah! (praise be to God)
For protecting us[a],
For the glory and the power of our God,

2|Because His judgments are absolutely correct in their truth[b],
Because He’s judged the Great Harlot
Who ruined the Earth
By polluting it with her fornication
And avenged the blood of His servants
Which was shed by her hand.


3|They completed what they had spoken by speaking a second time,

Hallelujah!
Her smoke billows up and billows up forever and ever.


4|And the twenty-four elders and the four creatures fell and worshiped the Almighty 
God who sits on the throne, saying,

The end at last[A]: Hallelujah!


5|And a voice issued forth from the throne saying,

Praise our God
All His servants
And all who reverence Him,
The insignificant and the important


6|And I heard the sound of something like a large crowd and like the sound of a large 
volume of rushing water and like the sound of strong thunder saying,

Hallelujah,
Because our Lord God Almighty reigns.

7|Let us rejoice and be glad
And give Him the glory,
Because the time has arrived for the lamb’s marriage,
And his bride-to-be has prepared herself,

8|And she was given bright, clean, fine linen to put on:
You see, the linen is the righteous deeds
Of the set-apart-people.

          
9|He then tells me, “Write this down: Blessed are those who’ve been invited to 
the lamb’s marriage dinner.”
      He continues, “These words are truly from God.”
          
10|I fell before His feet to worship Him. He then tells me, “Get ahold of 
yourself.[c] I’m a fellow-servant of yours and of your comrades who keep the statement 
of Jesus. Worship God, not me. You see, the official statement about Jesus is the 
underlying impetus[d] of prophecy.”
          
11|I saw the sky while it had been opened, and—like that—a white horse 
and mounted on it one called Ever True to His Faithful Nature[e], and he judges and 
wages war righteously. 
12|His eyes are like wheels of fire, and upon his head are 
many ornamental headbands[f], having names of his attributes, accomplishments, and titles 
written on them which nobody knows except he himself, 
13|and clothed in 
clothing that has been soaked in blood, and the name that he goes by is the Word of 
God. 
14|The soldier-garrison in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in 
clean, fine white linen. 
15|Out of his mouth protrudes a sharp Thracian sword, and 
it’s there so that he can strike the nations, and he personally shepherds (rules) them with 
a staff of iron. He himself treads the winepress of the wine of the ferocious wrath of 
God Almighty. 
16|He has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: 
King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
          
17|I saw an angel up in the upper atmosphere blocking the sun[B]. He 
shouted in a loud voice telling any bird that’s capable of flying at a high altitude[C], 
“Come gather yourselves for God’s Great Dinner, 
18|so that you get the chance to 
eat the meat of kings, of commanders, of mighty people, of horses and those mounted 
on them, of free men and not just them but of slaves, of the insignificant, and of the 
great.” 
19|And I saw the beast and the kings of the Earth and their soldiers 
gathered for the purpose of waging war against the one mounted on the horse and his 
troops.
          
20|And the beast was seized and with him the false prophet too, the one 
who performs miracles under his supervision, by such miracles he’s deceived those 
who’ve received the mark of the beast and those who worship his replica—the pair 
were thrown alive into the Lake of Fire, the lake burning in brimstone. 
*[a]protecting us…Lit: salvation
*[b]absolutely correct in their truth…Lit: true and correct. A sort of hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11.
*[c]Get ahold of yourself…Or: see to it that you don’t
*[d]underlying impetus…Lit: spirit
*[e]Ever True to His Faithful Nature…Lit: faithful and true. A hendiadys.
*[f]ornamental headbands…Lit: diadems

*[A]the end at last…Lit: amen. This well-known Hebrew word which, depending on the context, has one or 
more of the following meanings: the end at last; that is so true; that is the last of it; let it be so; so be it; 
the final word has been spoken; I/we affirm what you just said/did; the end; the end at last.
*[B]up in the upper atmosphere blocking the sun…Lit: in the sun. The ancients’ perception of the sun is that 
it was a lot closer to the Earth than it actually is. Consequently, a liberty taken to adapt the wording in a 
way that fits the modern perspective of astronomy.
[C]any bird that’s capable of flying at a high altitude…Lit: all birds the ones that fly in mid-heaven In 
regard to mid-heaven, ref. note of 8:13. Birds which are “capable of flying at a high altitude” refers to 
eagles and vultures and perhaps a few other carrion-eating types of birds. In any case, what’s referred to 
is birds which pick at dead carcasses and tear their flesh off.

Revelation

remainder were killed by the Thracian sword that comes out of the mouth of the one 
mounted on the horse, and all of the previously mentioned birds ate their flesh until they 
were too full to eat anymore.


&REV 20
1|I saw an angel come down out of the sky with the key to the abyss on him 
and with a huge chain in his hand, 
2|and he grabbed the dragon, the Ancient Serpent 
who is a slanderer[a]—yes, Satan—tied him up with the chain for a thousand years, 

3|tossed him into the abyss, locked it, and covered the top over and secured it[b] so 
that he couldn’t deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were up. After 
that, he must be set free for a little while.
          
4|I saw some thrones, and I saw those who were seated on them. They were 
assigned the task of presiding in judgment over the crimes perpetrated against the lives of 
those who had been beheaded on account of the statement of Jesus and the word of God 
and perpetrated against whoever wouldn’t worship the beast or his replica and wouldn’t 
receive the mark upon their foreheads and their hands. And they lived and reigned 
with the Messiah (the Christ) a thousand years. 
5|The rest of the dead weren’t 
brought back to life[c] until the thousand years was over. That’s the First Life-after-Death 
Epoch[d]. 
6|The person who takes part in the First Life-after-Death Epoch is blessed 
and holy; the second change of bodily state of being[e] has no power over these people, 
but instead they’ll be personal attendants[f] of God and of the Messiah, and they will 
reign with him for a thousand years.
          
7|But when the thousand years finally does end, Satan will be let out of jail. 

8|He’ll be set free to commit an act of deception upon the nations even to the farthest 
reach of the planet[A]—all the way to Timbuktu[B]—to gather them together for the War. 
There were gathered as many as the number of grains of sand on a typical seashore. 

9|As an army they deployed themselves in such a way as to occupy and control all the 
key territory[g] and surrounded the saints’ home base[h], which is the Beloved City—And 
flames came down from out of the sky and devoured them. 
10|“The Slanderer”—
the Devil, the one deceiving them—was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, 
where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they will be tormented day and night 
forever and ever.
          
11|I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it, One whom the Earth 
fled from the fierceness and intensity of His undivided attention[i]—and they found no 
place to escape it. 
12|I saw the spiritually dead who had died previously, the 
insignificant and the important, made to stand before the throne, and many books were 
opened, and apart from them another book was opened, which is called the Book of Life. 
And the dead were judged from what had been written in the many books, judged, that 
is, according to the deeds they had committed. 
13|The graveyard[C] coughed up its 
dead—the Grim Reaper returned his dead indeed[j]—and each was judged according to 
his deeds. 
14|And the Grim Reaper was thrown into the Lake of Fire. 
*[a]slanderer…Or: the Devil
*[b]covered the top over and secured it…Lit: sealed it shut above him
*[c]weren’t brought back to life…Lit: didn’t live
*[d]the First Life after Death Epoch…Lit: the First Resurrection
*[e]second change of bodily state of being…Lit: second death
*[f]personal attendants…Lit: priests
*[g]they deployed themselves in such a way as to occupy and control all the key territory…Lit: they went up 
upon the breadth of the Earth. An expression.
*[h]home base…Lit: encampment
*[i]undivided attention…Lit: face
*[j]the Grim Reaper returned his dead indeed…Lit: and Death and Hades gave their dead. An expression; 
some liberties taken.

*[A]the farthest reach of the planet…Lit: the four corners of the Earth. This is an expression. Though the 
ancient Greeks knew that the world was round, expressions continued to be circulated describing it as 
though it were flat and had four corners.
*[B]all the way to Timbuktu…Lit: the Gog and Magog. Gog and Magog are used as a metonymy for any 
nation of peoples who settled at an extreme distance from the center of civilization and over the 
centuries their whereabouts and any contact with them or knowledge of them had been lost.
[C]the graveyard…Lit: the sea. Some liberties taken. The sea is used symbolically in the Bible to represent 
the masses of humanity.

if any given person’s name wasn’t found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into 
the Lake of Fire.


&REV 21
1|I saw brand-new sky and brand-new ground, seeing that the original sky and 
the original ground had disappeared and that the sea didn’t exist anymore. 
2|I saw 
the Holy City of Jerusalem—a brand-new one—coming down out of the sky, coming 
from heaven, from God, gotten ready like a bride who put on her best dress along with her 
best jewelry, her best face, and arranged her hair in the best way in preparation of being 
joined to her husband-to-be. 
3|I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look—
God’s setting up camp with mankind[a]. He will camp out with them, and they will be 
His very own people, 
4|and He’ll wipe every tear from their eyes, and Death will not 
exist, nor will mourning, nor the screaming of anguish, nor will the pains of labor exist: 
the original stuff is gone.
          
5|The One seated on the throne said, “See here—I’m remaking and redoing 
everything.” He continued, “Write this down, since these very words are ever true in 
their faithfulness[b].” 
6|He told me, “It has come into being.[c] I am the A-to-Z[d], the 
beginning and the end. To him who thirsts, I allow to drink from the spring of the water 
of life, no strings attached. 
7|The one who triumphs in perseverance will inherit these 
things. I will be a god-figure[A] to him and he will be a son to me. 
8|Now as far as the 
cowardly, the worthless, the detestable, the murderers, the fornicators, the recreational 
drug-users, the idolaters, and all liars are concerned, they wind up in the lake which 
burns with fire and brimstone, which is the Second Death, the second bodily 
transformation of the disobedient.
          
9|One of the seven angels (the angels who have the seven bowls filled with the 
final seven plagues) came and conversed with me saying, “Come and I’ll show you the 
lamb’s wife-to-be, his bride.” 
10|In the Spirit he took me and put me on a huge, tall 
mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from 
God, 
11|having God’s glory. It was glimmering and radiating light like a gemstone 
does, like crystal-clear jasper, 
12|and had large, tall walls, twelve gates and twelve 
angels at each gate, and names inscribed on the gates that are from the twelve tribes of 
the sons of Israel. 
13|Three gates face east, three face north, three face south, and 
three face west. 
14|The city wall has twelve underlying bands of enormous stones 
which serve as its foundations, and upon them are the names of the twelve apostles of the 
lamb.
          
15|The angel who was conversing with me had a golden measuring stick, so 
that he could measure[B] the city, its gates, and its walls. 
16|The city is laid in a 
square, and its length and width are the same. Using the measuring stick, he measured 
the city to be 1500 miles/2400 km[e] long, and the width and the height are the same as 
the length. 
17|He measured its wall to be 215 ft/66 m high[C], in terms of human 
units of measurement, which is the same units that angels use. 
18|Its surrounding 
wall is jasper, and the city is pure gold like a clear glass. 
19|The foundation of the 
city walls is decorated with every kind of precious stone and gemstone imaginable. The 
first foundation is jasper, the second is sapphire, the third is agate, the fourth is 
emerald, 
20|the fifth is onyx, the sixth is ruby, the seventh is chrysolite, the eighth 
is beryl, the ninth is topaz, the tenth is turquoise, the eleventh is jacinth, the twelfth is 
amethyst. 
21|The twelve gates are twelve pearls, and each gate is made out of a 
single pearl. The main street of the city is pure gold like transparent glass.
          
22|I saw that there was no temple in it, since the Lord God Almighty is its 
temple, and so is the lamb. 
23|The city has no need to be illuminated by the light of 
the sun and the moon, since God’s glory shines on it and illuminates it, and the lamb is 
its lamp. 
24|The nations will be able to see clearly to walk about as a result of the 
city’s light, and the kings of the Earth bring their glory to it, contributing their very best to 
it. 
25|Its gates will never, ever shut because it’ll be daytime all the time[D], seeing 
that there will be no nighttime, 
26|and they will bring the very best things nations 
possess and their valuable artifacts into it. 
*[a]God’s setting up camp with mankind…Lit: the tabernacle of God with the men
*[b]ever true in their faithfulness…Lit: faithful and true. A hendiadys.
*[c]It has come into being…Almost the same word and almost the same inflected form as used in 16:17; 
ref. note for that verse.
*[d]the A-to-Z…Lit: the Alpha and the Omega
*[e]1500 miles/2400 km…Lit: 12,000 stadia. Ref. note of Luke 24:13 for conversion of units.
*[f]being who lies about doing detestable things…Lit: that doing detestable and a liar. A hendiadys.

*[A]god-figure…The word God in the GT of the NT is usually preceded with a definite article; this 
occurrence is not. This is not to say that God is simply a god-figure and not God. A god-figure is one who 
supplies what is necessary for survival. Pagans, in fact, view their idols as god-figures and credit them 
with providing what is needed for their survival. In the OT, the Jehovah-names for God do, for the most 
part, describe God as the ultimate god-figure, the one who promises to supply our survival needs. 
Hence, Jehovah Jireh (the Lord our Provider), Jehova Rapha (the Lord our Healer), Jehovah Nissi (the 
Lord our Banner), Jehovah Rohi (the Lord our Shepherd), etc.
*[B]measure…Measuring the city verifies that it is perfect, in the same way that exact dimensions of the 
tabernacle are specified in the Torah. The act of measuring confirms that it perfectly complies with 
God’s exacting standards; in this context, that it is made by God and not by man. Also, ref. note of Rev. 
11:2.
*[C]215 ft/ 66 meters high…Lit: 144 cubits. A cubit is approximately 18 inches/450 millimeters.
[D]daytime all the time…Gates in ancient cities were normally kept open during the day but shut at night, 
as to protect against bands of marauders who roamed the night and other such threats. With there 
being no night, there is no need to ever shut the gates.

Revelation
*[D]daytime all the time…Gates in ancient cities were normally kept open during the day but shut at night, 
as to protect against bands of marauders who roamed the night and other such threats. With there 
being no night, there is no need to ever shut the gates.

Revelation
27|And there’s no way whatsoever that 
any sort of base, degenerate being will enter, nor will any being who lies about doing 
detestable things[f]—only those who’ve been written in the lamb’s Book of Life may 
enter.


&REV 22
1|He then showed me a river of living water as clear as crystal, pouring out of 
God’s throne and out of the lamb 
2|and into the middle of the city’s main street. The 
tree of life yields fruit on either side of the river twelve times a year, each month, and the 
tree’s leaves are destined for the treatment and healing of the nations. 
3|No kind of 
curse (bad things which happen to people) will exist anymore. God’s throne will be in the 
city, and so will the lamb, and His servants will ritualistically offer up a service of 
worship to Him. 
4|His face will be visible, and His name will be seen upon their 
foreheads. 
5|There will no longer be any night, and there won’t be any need for 
lamplight and sunlight, because the Lord God will provide illumination for them and 
will reign forever and ever.
          
6|He told me, “These here words are ever true in their faithfulness[a].”
      The Lord, the God of the prophetic utterances of the prophets[A], sent His angel to 
show His servants what must come to pass post-haste.


7|See here—I’m coming post-haste. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of 
the prophecy in this scroll.

          
8|And, I, John, the one who’s listening to and watching all these things—when 
I heard and saw this, I fell on my face before the feet of the angel who’s showing me these 
things to worship him. 
9|He then tells me, “Get ahold of yourself. I’m a fellow-servant 
of yours, of your comrades the prophets, and of those adhering to the words in this 
scroll. Worship God, not me.” 
10|He then tells me, “Don’t deny access to[b] the 
prophetic words in this scroll, seeing that the time is near. 
11|Let he who behaves 
in a worthless manner yet continue in his worthlessness, let he who is foul yet continue 
to be foul and filthy, let he who’s righteous yet continue to act righteously, and he 
who’s holy yet continue to act like a saint.


12|See here—I’m coming post-haste. I have cash on hand to pay each person 
according to the work he’s done for the day.[B] 
13|I am the A-Z, the first and 
the last, beginning and the end.

          
14|Blessed are those who wash their robes, so they have the right[c] to the 
tree of life; and when they perchance desire to enter the city, they are permitted to use the 
gates. 
15|Outside the city[d] are the dogs, the recreational drug users, the fornicators, 
the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who is quite fond of lying and lies all the 
time[e].


16|I, Jesus, dispatched my agent to declare these things to you in the 
churches. I am the direct-descendant[f] of David, the Bright Morning Star. 


17|And the Spirit and the bride-to-be say, “Come!” And let the one who thirsts 
come, and let the one who so desires freely partake of the water of life.
          
18|I confirm[g] that I’ve heard all the prophetic words which are in this 
scroll. If anyone chooses to add to them, God will add all the plagues that are written in 
this scroll to his life. 
19|And if anyone chooses to delete words from this prophetic 
scroll, God will delete his access to the tree of life and to the holy city, which has been 
written about in this scroll.
          
20|He who confirms these things says:

“Yes indeed, I’m coming post-haste.”

      Let it be so[h]. Come Lord Jesus.

          
*[a]ever true in their faithfulness…Lit: faithful and true. A hendiadys. Same phrase used in Rev. 21:5.
*[b]deny access to…Lit: seal
*[c]right…Lit: authority
*[d]outside the city…Lit: outside. Ref. note of 14:20
*[e]quite fond of lying and lies all the time…Lit: all loving [phileō, (φιλέω/Strong’s 5368)] and practicing a 
lie. The awkward wording is a figure of speech.
*[f]the direct-descendant…Lit: the stock [root] and the lineage
*[g]confirm…Lit: testify
*[h]let it be so…Lit: amen. Ref. note of 19:4.

*[A]God of the prophetic utterances of the prophets…Lit: God of the spirits of the prophets…The phrase 
spirits of the prophets is an idiom. It also appears in 1 Cor. 14:32. These two passages qualify the idiom’s 
meaning.
[B]I have cash on hand to pay each person according to the work he’s done for the day…Lit: the wages of 
mine with me to give out to each as his work. The metaphor, used in the Gospels, is a man who hires 
day-workers and is expected to pay them in the evening of each workday.
