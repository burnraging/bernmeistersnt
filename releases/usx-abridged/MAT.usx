      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 2:2" />going about saying, “Where’s that child-king of the Jews? The fact is, we saw his star while over in

        Then after you find him, come tell me so that I can come and worship him too.” <verse eid="MAT 2:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAT 2:9" />Having heard this from the king, they went out and—just like that—the same star which they saw back east
        took the lead in front of them until it reached the place where the child was and then stood still up
        over that place. <verse eid="MAT 2:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAT 2:10" />Seeing what the star had done, they got really excited. <verse eid="MAT 2:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="MAT 2:11" />They went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary and fell flat on their faces and worshipped

        you see, is going about seeking to eliminate the child.” <verse eid="MAT 2:13" />

      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="MAT 2:23" />and when he got there, he settled in a city called Nazareth, in order that what the prophets had prophesied

      <verse number="57" style="v" sid="MAT 27:57" />At sunset a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself had also been discipled by Jesus—<verse eid="MAT 27:57" />
      <verse number="58" style="v" sid="MAT 27:58" />This fellow approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. Pilate then ordered for it to be given away.<verse eid="MAT 27:58" />
      <verse number="59" style="v" sid="MAT 27:59" />Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen, <verse eid="MAT 27:59" />
      <verse number="60" style="v" sid="MAT 27:60" />placed it in his newly-made tomb, which had been hewn into the rock, rolled a huge stone over to the
        tomb’s entrance, and left. <verse eid="MAT 27:60" />
      <verse number="61" style="v" sid="MAT 27:61" />Now, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sat down across from the tomb.<verse eid="MAT 27:61" />

      <verse number="62" style="v" sid="MAT 27:62" />That night, which is a day of preparation for the festival, the chief priests and the Pharisees got together
        and went to Pilate <verse eid="MAT 27:62" />
      <verse number="63" style="v" sid="MAT 27:63" />and said, “Sir, we remember what that grifter said while he was still alive, that he would be resurrected
        after three days. <verse eid="MAT 27:63" />
      <verse number="64" style="v" sid="MAT 27:64" />Therefore, give the order that the tomb be kept secure under guard from now until the third day comes,
        lest his disciples come and steal his bodyand tell the people, “He rose from the dead”; a final such
        deception would be worse than any deceiving he did before.” <verse eid="MAT 27:64" />
      <verse number="65" style="v" sid="MAT 27:65" />Pilate said to them, “You’ll get your guard; go out and secure it the best you know how.” <verse eid="MAT 27:65" />
      <verse number="66" style="v" sid="MAT 27:66" />So they went and secured the tomb, having fortified the rock as it stood against the entrance.<verse eid="MAT 27:66" />

      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="MAT 28:1" />After the back-to-back Sabbaths had ended, at the first light of day on Sunday, Mary Magdalene and the
        other Mary came to take a look at the tomb. <verse eid="MAT 28:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 28:2" />Wouldn’t you know—a huge convulsion had occurred; in fact, an angel sent from the Lord descended from
        out of the sky, went over to the stone, rolled it away, and sat down on top of it. <verse eid="MAT 28:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="MAT 28:3" />His appearance resembled lightning, and his outerwear was as white as snow. <verse eid="MAT 28:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="MAT 28:4" />Terrified of him, those keeping guard trembled violently until finally becoming as stiff as the dead,
        laid out on the ground. <verse eid="MAT 28:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="MAT 28:5" />The angel summed the situation up and said to the women, “Don’t be afraid, since I know that you’re looking
        for Jesus, the one who was crucified. <verse eid="MAT 28:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="MAT 28:6" />He’s not here, since he was resurrected just like he said he would be: go look at the place where he
        was laid to rest. <verse eid="MAT 28:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="MAT 28:7" />And—quickly now—go tell his disciples that he’s been resurrected from the dead, and in the meantime he’ll

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAT 28:9" />And out of nowhere, Jesus interrupted them saying, “Delighted to see you” They went to him and grabbed
        ahold of his feet, having prostrated themselves in worship before him. <verse eid="MAT 28:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAT 28:10" />Then Jesus, getting to the point, said to them, <char style="wj">“Don’t be afraid. Continue on your way
        and make the announcement to my comrades in order that they </char><char style="it"><char style="wj">too</char></char><char

      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="MAT 28:12" />They gathered the councilmen and met with them, and then they got a sizeable amount of cash to give to
        the soldiers <verse eid="MAT 28:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="MAT 28:13" />saying, “Say that his disciples came during the night and stole him while you were sleeping. <verse eid="MAT 28:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="MAT 28:14" />If this gets reported to the governor, we personally will smooth things over with him and fix it so that
        you won’t have anything to worry about.” <verse eid="MAT 28:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="MAT 28:15" />They took the cash and did as they were coached to do. And this account has been circulated among the
