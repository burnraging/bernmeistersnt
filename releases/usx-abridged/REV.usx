      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="REV 1:1" />A revelation—a revealing—by Jesus Christ of matters hidden, a revelation which God gave to him, to show
        his servants what must come to pass post-haste. He transmitted what he saw through His angel to his servant
        John, <verse eid="REV 1:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="REV 1:2" />who gave an official account of God’s discourse and of the statement of Jesus Christ. <verse eid="REV 1:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="REV 1:3" />Blessed be the one reading aloud to the congregation and the listeners in the congregation who hear the
        words of the prophecy and who keep what’s been written therein, for the time is near.<verse eid="REV 1:3" />

        Jesus. <verse eid="REV 1:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="REV 1:10" />I found myself in the Spirit on a Sunday and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet does when it

      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="REV 17:1" />One of the seven angels who has the seven bowls came and spoke with me saying, “Come, I’ll show you the
        verdict rendered against the Great Harlot who sits upon many different waters, <verse eid="REV 17:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="REV 17:2" />she whom the kings of the Earth fornicated with, and she whom the inhabitants of the Earth got drunk
        off the wine of her fornication.” <verse eid="REV 17:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="REV 17:3" />He took me up to an uninhabited, desolate place in the Spirit. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast,
        a beast plastered with blasphemous names, a woman who has seven heads and ten horns. <verse eid="REV 17:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="REV 17:4" />The woman was clothed in the purple clothing that the wealthy wear and in luxurious scarlet and was adorned
        in gold, gemstones, and pearls and had a golden cup in her hand filled with abominations and with the
        impurity and sacrilegious nature of her fornication. <verse eid="REV 17:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="REV 17:5" />There was a name written on her forehead—a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the mother of fornicators and
        prostitutes and of the abominations of the Earth.” <verse eid="REV 17:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="REV 17:6" />I saw the woman intoxicated from drinking the blood of the set-apart-people and the blood of those who
        make statements about Jesus.</para>
    <para style="p" vid="REV 17:6">Upon seeing her, I was stupefied gawking at her. <verse eid="REV 17:6"/>
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="REV 17:7" />The angel told me, “What are you gawking at? I’ll explain to you the mystery of the woman and the beast
        that’s bearing her, the one with the seven heads and the ten horns. <verse eid="REV 17:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="REV 17:8" />The beast which you saw came up out of the abyss in the past, is not out of the abyss at the present,
        but is about to come up out of the abyss, and is headed to its own demise. The existing inhabitants of
        the Earth who don’t have their names written in the Book of Life from the beginning of time seeing the
        beast will be amazed, because the beast came up out of the abyss in the past, is not out of it at present,
        but will be showing up some time in the future.<verse eid="REV 17:8" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="REV 17:9" />Here’s something for a person who has a mind for intrigue: the seven heads are mountains where the woman
        is sitting. These are seven kings. <verse eid="REV 17:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="REV 17:10" />Five have fallen, one still exists, the other hasn’t come into being yet, but when he does in fact come
        into being, he must remain a little while. <verse eid="REV 17:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="REV 17:11" />The beast which came in the past and isn’t present now: it’s the eighth and comes out of the seven, and
        is headed to its own demise. <verse eid="REV 17:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="REV 17:12" />The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who haven’t gotten a kingdom yet, but instead receive from the
        beast authority as kings for one hour. <verse eid="REV 17:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="REV 17:13" />These guys have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. <verse eid="REV 17:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="REV 17:14" />These guys will go to war with the lamb, and the lamb will conquer them, since he is Lord of Lords and
        King of Kings, and so will those with him: the called, the chosen, the faithful.<verse eid="REV 17:14" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="REV 17:15" />He then says to me, “The waters that you saw the harlot sitting on: they are cluster after cluster of
        folk-people, are nations, and are those who share a common dialect. <verse eid="REV 17:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="REV 17:16" />The ten horns which you saw, and the beast included: these guys hate the harlot and will strip her bare
        and have her for lunch. <verse eid="REV 17:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="REV 17:17" />The fact is, God will cause them to willingly do His purpose, and that purpose is towards one goal only:
        to give their kingdom to the beast, until such a time that God’s ideas be completed. <verse eid="REV 17:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="REV 17:18" />And the woman which you saw is the Great City which has a kingdom built upon the kings of the Earth.<verse eid="REV 17:18" />
