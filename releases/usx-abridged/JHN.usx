  <chapter number="1" style="c" sid="JHN 1" />
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JHN 1:1" />In the beginning was the Concept, and the Concept was with God, and the Concept was God, having His very
        nature. <verse eid="JHN 1:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="JHN 1:2" />This person was in the beginning with God. <verse eid="JHN 1:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JHN 1:3" />Through him all things came into being, and nothing which has come into being came into being apart from
        him. <verse eid="JHN 1:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="JHN 1:4" />In him was life, and the Life was the light of mankind. <verse eid="JHN 1:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="JHN 1:5" />And in the midst of it all the Light shined in the Darkness, and the Darkness couldn’t take it down,
        overpower it, or contain it.<verse eid="JHN 1:5" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="JHN 1:6" />A man sent from God appeared on the scene, and his name was John. <verse eid="JHN 1:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="JHN 1:7" />This fellow came to give an official account, so that he would give an account concerning the Light,
        so that all would believe through him. <verse eid="JHN 1:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JHN 1:8" />That fellow was not the Light—instead, he came in order that he would testify about the Light: <verse eid="JHN 1:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="JHN 1:9" />It was the True Light, that which shines to all mankind, while coming into the world, the established
        order of humans. <verse eid="JHN 1:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="JHN 1:10" />He was in and among the world and the world came into being through him, but the world didn’t know him.<verse eid="JHN 1:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 1:11" />He went to his own particular group of people, and his own didn’t whole-heartedly welcome and embrace
        him. <verse eid="JHN 1:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="JHN 1:12" />But to whomever whole-heartedly welcomed and embraced him, it was to them he gave the authorization and
        power to become children of God, to those who believe and have faith in his established authority, <verse eid="JHN 1:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="JHN 1:13" />to those who were begotten neither out of spillings of blood nor out of a best-effort of self nor out
        of carnal desire nor out of the will of a man, but instead were begotten from God.<verse eid="JHN 1:13" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JHN 1:14" />And the Concept became flesh and set up camp among us. We beheld his glory, glory as that of an only-begotten
        issued from the Father, full of grace and truth. <verse eid="JHN 1:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 1:15" />John testified about him, having cried out, “This fellow here is the one I referred to when I said, ‘The
        one who comes after me has been the center of my attention, because he was (and is) superior to me.’”<verse eid="JHN 1:15" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="JHN 1:16" />When you get to the bottom of it all, all of us have received of his fullness, and grace piled on top
        of grace. <verse eid="JHN 1:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JHN 1:17" />When you get to the bottom of it all, the Old Testament Law was given through Moses; the grace and the
        truth which we’re talking about came into being through Jesus Christ. <verse eid="JHN 1:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="JHN 1:18" />Nobody has seen God fully; God’s only-begotten, who’s in tight with the Father—that’s the person who
        brought Him out of obscurity.”<verse eid="JHN 1:18" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="JHN 1:19" />John’s testimony</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 1:19">When the Judean Jews sent priests and clergymen from Jerusalem to him in order to ask, “Who are you?”,<verse eid="JHN 1:19"/>
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="JHN 1:20" />he gave them a straight-up answer saying forthrightly, “Me?—No, I’m not the Messiah.” <verse eid="JHN 1:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="JHN 1:21" />They asked him, </para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 1:21">“Just who are you? Are you Elijah?”</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 1:21">Jumping right in, he said, “No, I’m not.”</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 1:21">“Are you the Prophet?”</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 1:21">He answered, “No.”<verse eid="JHN 1:21"/>
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="JHN 1:22" />So they said to him, “Who are you then?—Tell us so we can give a reply to those who sent us. Who do you
        claim to be?”<verse eid="JHN 1:22" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="JHN 1:23" />He said, “I’m a…</para>

    <para style="m" vid="JHN 1:23">“…as written by the Prophet Isaiah.”<verse eid="JHN 1:23"/>
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="JHN 1:24" />Now the ones who had been sent were sent by the Pharisees. <verse eid="JHN 1:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="JHN 1:25" />They posed a question asking, “So now, why do you perform baptisms if you’re neither the Messiah, Elijah,
        nor the Prophet?” <verse eid="JHN 1:25" />
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="JHN 1:26" />John replied by saying, “My role is to baptize in water. But someone has taken a stand in your midst,
        someone whom you have no first-hand knowledge of, <verse eid="JHN 1:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="JHN 1:27" />someone who follows in my footsteps, someone whom I’m not even worthy of unfastening his sandal strap.”<verse eid="JHN 1:27" />
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="JHN 1:28" />These things took place in Bethany alongside the Jordan River, the place where John was baptizing.<verse eid="JHN 1:28" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="JHN 1:29" />The next day he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, “Look here—God’s lamb who takes away the world’s
        sin. <verse eid="JHN 1:29" />
      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="JHN 1:30" />This is the person whom I referred to when I said, ‘A man’s coming who’ll follow in my footsteps, a man
        who has become the center of my attention because he is superior to me because he was in existence before
        I was.’ <verse eid="JHN 1:30" />
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="JHN 1:31" />I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, he was not known even to me in order
        he would become known to Israel all at once. This is the reason my role was to come baptizing in water.”<verse eid="JHN 1:31" />
      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="JHN 1:32" />And John solemnly declared in a statement for the record that he had beheld the Spirit coming down out
        of the sky like a dove and remaining upon him from then on: <verse eid="JHN 1:32" />
      <verse number="33" style="v" sid="JHN 1:33" />”I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, the One who sent me to baptize in water,
        He’s the One who said to me, ‘Upon whom you happen to behold the Spirit coming down and remaining upon,
        that’s the person who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ <verse eid="JHN 1:33" />
      <verse number="34" style="v" sid="JHN 1:34" />And I have beheld this event personally and have solemnly attested that this person is the Son of God.”<verse eid="JHN 1:34" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="35" style="v" sid="JHN 1:35" />Again, the next day John was just standing there, he and two of his disciples, <verse eid="JHN 1:35" />
      <verse number="36" style="v" sid="JHN 1:36" />and saw Jesus going here and there, and interjected, “Look here—God’s lamb.” <verse eid="JHN 1:36" />
      <verse number="37" style="v" sid="JHN 1:37" />His two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus, in order to become his disciples. <verse eid="JHN 1:37" />
      <verse number="38" style="v" sid="JHN 1:38" />Jesus turned and saw them following him and, prompting them, said, “What can I do for you?” So they said
        to him, “Rabbi (which is translated ‘Teacher’), where are you staying?” <verse eid="JHN 1:38" />
      <verse number="39" style="v" sid="JHN 1:39" />Keeping their curiosity, he said, “Come and see.” So they went and saw where he was staying and remained
        in his company that day; it was late afternoon around four. <verse eid="JHN 1:39" />
      <verse number="40" style="v" sid="JHN 1:40" />One of the two who used to be John’s disciples who heard and became his, Jesus’s, disciple was Simon
        Peter’s brother Andrew. <verse eid="JHN 1:40" />
      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="JHN 1:41" />First thing he did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “I’ve found the Messiah” (which translated
        means ‘Christ’). <verse eid="JHN 1:41" />
      <verse number="42" style="v" sid="JHN 1:42" />He led him to Jesus. Jesus saw him and said, “<char style="wj">You are Simon son of John. You’ll be called
        ‘Cephas’” </char>(which translated means ‘Peter’).<verse eid="JHN 1:42" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="43" style="v" sid="JHN 1:43" />He wanted to depart for Galilee the next day, and he winds up finding Phillip. Jumping right in, Jesus
        said to him, “Be my follower.” <verse eid="JHN 1:43" />
      <verse number="44" style="v" sid="JHN 1:44" />Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same city that Andrew and Peter were from. <verse eid="JHN 1:44" />
      <verse number="45" style="v" sid="JHN 1:45" />Philip tracked down Nathanael and, figuring he’d get a reply, said to him,</para>

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JHN 2:1" />A wedding occurred on a Tuesday in Cana, Galilee, and Jesus’s mother was attending. <verse eid="JHN 2:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="JHN 2:2" />Jesus was also invited—and so were his disciples—to the wedding. <verse eid="JHN 2:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JHN 2:3" />Having run out of wine, Jesus’s mother, in the heat of the moment, said to him,</para>

    <para style="p">

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="JHN 2:6" />Now according to the Jewish purification restrictions, there were six large clay pots lying nearby, with
        a capacity of up to a keg or a keg and a half apiece. <verse eid="JHN 2:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="JHN 2:7" />Jesus, on top of the situation, told them, <char style="wj">“Fill the pots with water.” </char>They filled
        the pots all the way up with water. <verse eid="JHN 2:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JHN 2:8" />Continuing his train of thought, he told them, <char style="wj">“Now draw some water </char><char style="it"><char
        style="wj">from one of the pots</char></char><char style="wj"> and bring it to the maître ‘d.”</char>
        So they brought some over to him. <verse eid="JHN 2:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="JHN 2:9" />As the maître ‘d tasted the water-which-had-become-wine, not knowing where it came from (the waiters
        who had drawn the water knew), the maître ‘d called for the groom <verse eid="JHN 2:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="JHN 2:10" />and, going over procedures, told him, “Every person sets out the good wine first and when everyone eventually

      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 2:11" />This miracle that Jesus performed in Cana, Galilee was the first in a long series of miracles signalling

      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JHN 2:14" />In the temple he ran across those selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at
        tables, <verse eid="JHN 2:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 2:15" />and he made a whip out of a cord and drove them all out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle.
        He swept the money changers’ coins off the tables spilling them all over the floor and overturned the
        tables. <verse eid="JHN 2:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="JHN 2:16" />He told the dove sellers, <char style="wj">“Get out of here—don’t turn my Father’s house into a merchandising

      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JHN 2:17" />His disciples remembered a verse of Scripture that says, “The zeal for Your house utterly consumes me.”<verse eid="JHN 2:17" />

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="JHN 2:18" />The Judean Jews, putting two plus two together, responded, “What spectacular miracle will you demonstrate

      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="JHN 2:19" />Jesus answered, <char style="wj">“Break this temple into pieces and I’ll raise it </char><char style="it"><char

      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="JHN 2:21" />But that ol’ boy was by obsession talking about the temple of his body. <verse eid="JHN 2:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="JHN 2:22" />So now, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered what he was saying in that moment

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="JHN 2:23" />As he was in the temple in Jerusalem during the Passover, many believed that he had authority bequeathed

      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="JHN 2:24" />Jesus, however, wasn’t inclined to trust them on account of him having an understanding of everything
        and everyone. <verse eid="JHN 2:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="JHN 2:25" />He didn’t need anyone to spell out plainly and clearly the aspects of human nature; the fact is, he was

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JHN 5:1" />After these things occurred, there was a Jewish holiday festival, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <verse eid="JHN 5:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="JHN 5:2" />Among the citizens of Jerusalem, there was a pool at the Sheep Gate (which in Aramaic is called Bethesda),
        which has five porticos. <verse eid="JHN 5:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JHN 5:3" />In these porticos lay a multitude of those who are feeble with sicknesses of one sort or another, of
        the blind, the lame, and those with shriveled-up limbs, perpetually lying there. <verse eid="JHN 5:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="JHN 5:4" /> <verse eid="JHN 5:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="JHN 5:5" />Now there was a man with a sickness who had been there for thirty-eight years, and his sickness made
        him feeble. <verse eid="JHN 5:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="JHN 5:6" />Seeing this fellow lying there, Jesus, knowing that he had been there for a long time, engaged him in
        conversation and said, <char style="wj">“Do you want to get better?” </char><verse eid="JHN 5:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="JHN 5:7" />The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no person to toss me into the pool when the water’s been agitated.
        While it’s agitated and I’m on my way to the pool, someone else cuts in front of me.” <verse eid="JHN 5:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JHN 5:8" />Jesus got to the point and said, <char style="wj">“Get up, pick the cot up, take it, and walk around,”</char><verse eid="JHN 5:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="JHN 5:9" />and the man got better immediately, picked his cot up, and walked around.</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 5:9">But that was on a Sabbath. <verse eid="JHN 5:9"/>
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="JHN 5:10" />So now, the Judean Jews proceeded to say to the man who had been healed,</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 5:10">“It’s the Sabbath, and you’re not allowed to pick up your cot and take it somewhere.”<verse eid="JHN 5:10"/>
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 5:11" />He replied, “The guy who made me well told me, <char style="wj">‘Pick it up and walk around’</char>.”<verse eid="JHN 5:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="JHN 5:12" />They asked, “Who’s the person who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk around’?” <verse eid="JHN 5:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="JHN 5:13" />But the man who was healed didn’t know who it was; you see, Jesus had ducked out of sight and into the
        crowd. <verse eid="JHN 5:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JHN 5:14" />After all of this, Jesus found him in the temple and said, <char style="wj">“I see you’re all better
        now. Don’t go about sinning, lest something worse happen to you.”</char> <verse eid="JHN 5:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 5:15" />The man left from there and reported to the Judeans that Jesus was the one who made him better. <verse eid="JHN 5:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="JHN 5:16" />Because of this, the Judeans began to go after Jesus, because he did this on the Sabbath. <verse eid="JHN 5:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JHN 5:17" />Jesus’s reply to them was, <char style="wj">“Up to the present moment, my Father’s been doing </char><char
        style="it"><char style="wj">good</char></char><char style="wj"> deeds, and is doing good deeds, and so
        am I</char><char style="wj">.” </char><verse eid="JHN 5:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="JHN 5:18" />So because of this, the Judeans were all the more trying to kill him, because he wasn’t just going about
        freeing people from their sicknesses on the Sabbath, but he also kept saying that God is his own Father,
        making himself out to be equal to God.<verse eid="JHN 5:18" />

        the authority vested in him.<verse eid="JHN 20:31" />

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JHN 21:1" />After these things Jesus manifested himself once more to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. Now this
        is the way he made his appearance: <verse eid="JHN 21:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="JHN 21:2" />Simon Peter; Thomas (i.e. “Twin”); Nathanael, who was from Cana, Galilee; the sons of Zebedee; and two
        of his other disciples were together. <verse eid="JHN 21:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JHN 21:3" />Simon Peter then tells them, “I’m going fishing.” They then say, “We’re coming with you.” They left,
        boarded the boat they used for fishing, and caught nothing that night.<verse eid="JHN 21:3" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="JHN 21:4" />Now it had already become early morning. Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however didn’t know
        it was him. <verse eid="JHN 21:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="JHN 21:5" />So Jesus says, <char style="wj">“Boys</char><char style="wj">, you don’t have anything that’s edible—</char><char
        style="it"><char style="wj">namely</char></char><char style="wj"> </char><char style="it"><char style="wj">fish</char></char><char
        style="it"><char style="wj">—</char></char><char style="wj">now do you?”</char> They replied, “No.” <verse eid="JHN 21:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="JHN 21:6" />So he said, <char style="wj">“Cast the net over the starboard side of the boat, and you’ll get some.”</char>
        So they cast the net and could barely haul it in due to the huge number of fish. <verse eid="JHN 21:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="JHN 21:7" />That disciple whom Jesus loved and loved then says to Peter, “It’s the Lord!” Simon Peter, after he heard
        that it’s the Lord, took off the coat which was wrapped around him (he was naked underneath, you see)
        and dove into the sea. <verse eid="JHN 21:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JHN 21:8" />But the other disciples came in with the boat, seeing that they were not far from land, no, not far at
        all, only about 100 yards/90 meters away, dragging the net full of fish.<verse eid="JHN 21:8" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="JHN 21:9" />As they got out onto the dry ground, they see a charcoal fire spread out over the ground and grilled
        fish laid on top of the fire, plus bread. <verse eid="JHN 21:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="JHN 21:10" />Jesus then tells them, <char style="wj">“Pull out the fish that you caught just now.”</char> <verse eid="JHN 21:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 21:11" />So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net full of enormous fish onto the land, 153 in all. The net
        didn’t tear, even though there were so many fish.<verse eid="JHN 21:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="JHN 21:12" />Jesus then tells them, <char style="wj">“Come have breakfast.”</char> Now none of the disciples dared
        to question who he was—they knew he was the Lord. <verse eid="JHN 21:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="JHN 21:13" />Jesus then comes and takes the bread and passes it out to them, and the grilled fish likewise. <verse eid="JHN 21:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JHN 21:14" />This is the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.<verse eid="JHN 21:14" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 21:15" />When they finished with breakfast, Jesus then says to Simon Peter, <char style="wj">“Simon son of John</char><char

        he then tells him, <char style="wj">“Follow me, </char><char style="it"><char style="wj">even</char></char><char

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="JHN 21:20" />Peter turns to face and look at the disciple who was following them, the one whom Jesus loved and loved,
        the person who also was the one leaning against him at the dinner they had and said, “Lord, who’s your
        betrayer?” <verse eid="JHN 21:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="JHN 21:21" />Looking at this fellow, Peter then says to Jesus, “Lord, now what about this fellow?” <verse eid="JHN 21:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="JHN 21:22" />Jesus then tells him, <char style="wj">“If I were to want him to remain </char><char style="it"><char

      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="JHN 21:23" />So this statement circulated among the comrades, that that disciple won’t ever die. Now Jesus didn’t
        tell him that he wouldn’t die, rather, <char style="wj">“If I WERE to WANT him to remain</char><char
        style="wj">…”</char><verse eid="JHN 21:23" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="JHN 21:24" />This is the disciple, the one who’s going on record and giving an official account about these things
        and the one who’s writing this book of the Bible. And we know that his official account is trustworthy.<verse eid="JHN 21:24" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="JHN 21:25" />Now there’s a lot of other things that Jesus did, so many so that if every detail were to be written
        down one-by-one, my hunch is that there wouldn’t be enough room in the world to store all the scrolls
        that would be written.<verse eid="JHN 21:25" />
