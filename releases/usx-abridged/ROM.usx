  <chapter number="1" style="c" sid="ROM 1" />
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 1:1" />Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called as a missionary, designated to God’s good news—the Gospel, <verse eid="ROM 1:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 1:2" />what He promised before over and over through His prophets in the Old Testament <verse eid="ROM 1:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 1:3" />about His son, who—physically speaking—came into being through the lineage of David, <verse eid="ROM 1:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 1:4" />who was declared in a powerful way to be God’s son according to the Holy Spirit due to the resurrection
        from the dead, namely Jesus Christ our Lord, <verse eid="ROM 1:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 1:5" />through whom we’ve received grace and have received a missionary assignment that has the end-goal of
        obedience—a consequence of faith—among all the Gentiles and the far-off nations on behalf of all he stands
        for, <verse eid="ROM 1:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 1:6" />by which you too are called by Jesus Christ:<verse eid="ROM 1:6" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 1:7" />To God’s beloved who are holy and called of God who are in Rome: Grace be to you—and peace—from the Father-God
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.<verse eid="ROM 1:7" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 1:8" />First and foremost, concerning you I thank my God through Jesus Christ, that the word is being spread
        about your faith throughout the entire world. <verse eid="ROM 1:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 1:9" />In fact, God is my witness, whom I offer a service of worship to in my spirit in the evangelization of
        his son, as I’m constantly making mention of you <verse eid="ROM 1:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 1:10" />every time I offer up prayers, asking if somehow, sometime, I will have succeeded by the will of God
        in visiting you. <verse eid="ROM 1:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 1:11" />The fact of the matter is that I long to see you so that I might bestow on you a spiritual gift, a gift
        whose goal is to establish you. <verse eid="ROM 1:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 1:12" />This bestowing of a spiritual gift is done to take comfort together with you through the faith shared
        between you and me.<verse eid="ROM 1:12" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 1:13" />I don’t want you to be left in the dark, comrades, that I purposed many times to come to you, but I was
        prevented from doing so up until now, so that I would have the opportunity in the meantime to observe
        the germination and growth of tangible signs of maturity among you as well just I observed it in the
        other Gentiles— <verse eid="ROM 1:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 1:14" />I’m in debt not just to the civilized but to the uncivilized also, to not just the wise but to the foolish
        also. <verse eid="ROM 1:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 1:15" />This is what motivates me to evangelize to you too who are in Rome.<verse eid="ROM 1:15" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 1:16" />The fact of the matter is, I’m not ashamed of the Gospel, for it’s God’s power in all those who believe
        for them to end up with salvation (i.e., the state of being kept from from spiritual, moral, mental,
        and physical calamity)—and not just the Jews but the non-Jewish Westerners as well. <verse eid="ROM 1:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 1:17" />For in the Gospel God’s righteousness (i.e., God’s requirements of how a person must lead his life in
        order to please Him and be approved by Him) is revealed out of faith and back into faith, just as it’s
        been written in the Old Testament, “The one who’s righteous (i.e., the one whose life is to be approved
        by God) shall live out of faith.”<verse eid="ROM 1:17" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 1:18" />You see, God’s wrath is unfurled from up in the sky, up in heaven, upon ungodliness and unrighteousness
        inherent in people who withhold the truth in and by their unrighteousness, <verse eid="ROM 1:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 1:19" />and it is unfurled because the knowledge of God has appeared and been made known to them. <verse eid="ROM 1:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 1:20" />To this point, from the inception of human society, His invisible aspects (that is, His everlasting power
        and divine nature) have been clearly seen and understood by means of the things which were created, resulting
        in all humans being without excuse. <verse eid="ROM 1:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 1:21" />Therefore, while knowing and understanding God, they didn’t glorify or thank Him as God, but became empty-headed
        in their reasonings instead, and their non-understanding heart darkened. <verse eid="ROM 1:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 1:22" />Asserting to be wise, they became idiots <verse eid="ROM 1:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 1:23" />and exchanged the glory of the Immortal God for the facsimile of a Mortal Human and of animals.<verse eid="ROM 1:23" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 1:24" />So for the aforementioned reasons, as they were wallowing in the desires of their hearts, God handed
        them over to dirty and disgusting unholy things in dishonoring and disgracing their bodies among themselves,<verse eid="ROM 1:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 1:25" />the very people who, as they were wallowing in the aforementioned lie, swapped the truth of God and worshipped
        and held religious services for the creature, circumventing the Creator, the One who is forever blessed
        (and let us pause a moment for that to sink in).<verse eid="ROM 1:25" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 1:26" />On account of this, God handed them over to an unnatural, disgraceful, excruciating passion of lust.
        In this regard, both the women swapped the Natural Function for that which circumvents what comes naturally;<verse eid="ROM 1:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 1:27" />and the men too—and in the same manner—leaving the Natural Function of the woman, burning in their longing
        for one another, men perpetrating the disgraceful deed with men and receiving the corresponding reward
        which they have coming to them and which they were bound to receive due to their error, an error which
        they adhered to among themselves.<verse eid="ROM 1:27" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 1:28" />And just as they did not approve of retaining the accumulated knowledge and understanding of God, God
        handed them over to an unapproved mind, to do what is not fitting to do, <verse eid="ROM 1:28" />
      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 1:29" />having been filled to the brim with every kind of unrighteousness: with wickedness, greed, malice, they
        are full of envy, murder, strife, Machiavellian-styled rivalry, malevolence; they’re gossips and slanderers,<verse eid="ROM 1:29" />
      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 1:30" />trash-talkers, God-haters; they’re insolent people, they’re arrogant, they’re braggarts, they dream up
        evil, they rebel against their parents, <verse eid="ROM 1:30" />
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 1:31" />they’re dull-witted, treacherous, without the natural affection one has for parents, children, nation,
        etc.; they’re unmerciful— <verse eid="ROM 1:31" />
      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 1:32" />The very people who know and understand God’s righteous precepts exactly, that those who practice such
        things deserve to die—not only do they do these things, but they’re in lockstep-agreement and think highly
        of those who practice them.<verse eid="ROM 1:32" />

  <chapter number="2" style="c" sid="ROM 2" />
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 2:1" />…Which leads to this: who do you think you are, you who pronounces judgment over others (i.e., draws
        conclusions about others for the purpose of writing them off)?—There’s no excuse for this. The fact is,
        in the area in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, for the one who’s doing the judging practices
        the same thing. <verse eid="ROM 2:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 2:2" />Now we know for a fact that God renders a guilty verdict in line with the truth against those who practice
        such things. <verse eid="ROM 2:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 2:3" />You rascal, you who commits such sins and practices such things—do you figure that you’ll evade God’s
        judgment? <verse eid="ROM 2:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 2:4" />Or while despising the riches of His goodness, forbearance and patience, you’re unaware that the goodness
        of God leads one to repentance (i.e., to change one’s heart and one’s ways)? <verse eid="ROM 2:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 2:5" />But in accordance with your hard—downright unrepentant—heart, you’re accumulating your own individualized-wrath
        to be regurgitated on that date when wrath is unveiled and readily distributed, the day of God’s righteous
        judgment, <verse eid="ROM 2:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 2:6" />Who “will repay every person according to what that person’s done.” <verse eid="ROM 2:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 2:7" />On the one hand to those who, in accordance with a consistent pattern of good works, seek after glory,
        honor, and immortality, the repayment will be eternal life. <verse eid="ROM 2:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 2:8" />But on the other hand, to those who, out of an attempt to promote themselves by buying influence with
        God and out of not being persuaded and being disobedience to the Truth but are convinced that doing unrighteousness
        is alright, the repayment will be wrath and an outburst of rage— <verse eid="ROM 2:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 2:9" />Distress and anguish for every last person who leads a life of evil, Jews at a higher level and non-Jewish
        Westerners at a level below them. <verse eid="ROM 2:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 2:10" />But glory, honor, and peace to all who lead a life of good, Jews at a higher level and Westerners at
        a level below them. <verse eid="ROM 2:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 2:11" />The fact of the matter is that God shows no favoritism.<verse eid="ROM 2:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 2:12" />You see, anyone at all who sinned without the benefit of possessing a law (i.e., a list of God’s rules)
        will perish; and anyone at all who sins while immersed in a law will be judged by that law. <verse eid="ROM 2:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 2:13" />To be clear, it’s not the ones who have heard a law and can spout off what it says who are right with
        God, but the ones who put a law into practice will be pronounced righteous by God.<verse eid="ROM 2:13" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 2:14" />To this point, when the Gentiles who don’t have a law (i.e., a list of God’s rules) instinctively do
        the things of the Law (i.e., the definitive, comprehensive list of God’s rules, which is the Law of Moses),
        they, though not possessing the Law, are a law (i.e., a set of God-given rules) for themselves. <verse eid="ROM 2:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 2:15" />These particular people point out what the law written in their hearts (i.e., their particular list of
        God’s rules written in their hearts) has accomplished—and while pointing this out their consciences join
        in and testify even to the extent of arbitrating between the various differing rationales condemning
        or defending— <verse eid="ROM 2:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 2:16" />on whatever day it happens to be when God judges the hidden things of mankind through Christ Jesus according
        to my positive message—my Gospel.<verse eid="ROM 2:16" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 2:17" />Now if you call yourself a Jew and are fixated on law (i.e., mankind possessing and putting into practice
        the definitive list of God’s rules), boast over (i.e., take pride in; swagger over; loudly extol the
        virtues of; defend vociferously) the things of God, <verse eid="ROM 2:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 2:18" />know the will of God, and accept or reject the differing oral traditions of interpretation which are
        derived from the Law of Moses— <verse eid="ROM 2:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 2:19" />and all these to the extent that you’ve convinced yourself that you’ve reached the point where you’re
        a guide to the blind, a light in darkness, <verse eid="ROM 2:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 2:20" />a trainer to the foolish, a teacher to the young, possessing in the Law of Moses the embodiment of the
        knowledge and the truth of God— <verse eid="ROM 2:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 2:21" />so now, does the one who’s teaching someone else teach himself anything? Does the one who preaches to
        others not to steal steal himself? <verse eid="ROM 2:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 2:22" />Does the one who says “don’t commit adultery” commit adultery? Is the one who abhors idols a temple robber?<verse eid="ROM 2:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 2:23" />Does the one who boasts in law (i.e., takes pride in—to the point of bragging about—his ability to follow
        the list of God’s rules) dishonor God by the transgression of the Law of Moses? <verse eid="ROM 2:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 2:24" />In fact, “God’s reputation is slandered among the Gentiles because of you,” like it says in the Bible.<verse eid="ROM 2:24" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 2:25" />The fact of the matter is that—yes—circumcision (i.e., committing one’s life to following the Law of
        Moses) is beneficial if one were to put the edicts of the Law of Moses into practice, but if one were
        to transgress the Law, his circumcision will have become uncircumcision (i.e., as though he never committed
        himself to follow the Law of Moses). <verse eid="ROM 2:25" />
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 2:26" />So if the archetypical circumcised man were to keep the edicts of the Law of Moses, wouldn’t his uncircumcision
        count as circumcision? <verse eid="ROM 2:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 2:27" />And the physically-uncircumcised man who satisfies the requirements of the Law of Moses will judge you,
        the quintessential transgressor of law (i.e., one who doesn’t fulfill the requirements of the list of
        edicts given by God), a transgressor in the midst of having a verbatim copy of God’s edicts and by having
        signed up to comply with those edicts.<verse eid="ROM 2:27" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 2:28" />You see, a person is not Jewish because he appears Jewish on the outside, nor is circumcision a physical
        characteristic, <verse eid="ROM 2:28" />
      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 2:29" />but rather one is Jewish by virtue of what’s on the inside, and circumcision is of the heart done by
        the Spirit not by the letter (i.e., by the rigid interpretation and application of God’s edicts); that
        person’s praise is not from people but from God.<verse eid="ROM 2:29" />

  <chapter number="3" style="c" sid="ROM 3" />
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 3:1" />So what’s so much better about being Jewish? Put another way, what’s the advantage of being circumcised
        (i.e., being in a covenant to obey the Law of Moses)? <verse eid="ROM 3:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 3:2" />Much and in many ways. First—certainly first—is that they were entrusted with the safekeeping and preservation
        of God’s words. <verse eid="ROM 3:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 3:3" />So now, what if some of them refused to have faith and believe? Does their refusal to believe cancel
        God’s faithfulness?— <verse eid="ROM 3:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 3:4" />Don’t even think about it; think this instead: God is true, but every person is a liar, just like it’s
        written,</para>
    <para style="pi" vid="ROM 3:4"></para>
    <para style="pi" vid="ROM 3:4">…So You’d be absolutely right in Your words</para>

    </para>
    <para style="pi" />    <!-- Spacer line. No verse associated with it. -->
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 3:5" />Now if our unrighteousness causes us to become aligned with the righteousness of God, what’s the takeaway?
        It isn’t that God, Who brings the wrath which He’s deemed justifiable upon select individuals, is unfair?
        (I’m talking about “unfair” in terms of human standards of fair and unfair.) <verse eid="ROM 3:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 3:6" />Don’t even think about it—otherwise, how will God judge the world (i.e., those who are a part of the
        ungodly society which mankind formed)? <verse eid="ROM 3:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 3:7" />But if in the My Fraud Falsehood the truth of God proliferates to His glory, why am I still being judged
        like I’m a sinner, <verse eid="ROM 3:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 3:8" />and not being judged according to the way in which we’re being slandered, in which some people are saying
        that our position is: let’s do these things here which are evil in order that these things here which
        are good will come? Their condemnation of our so-called position is justified.<verse eid="ROM 3:8" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 3:9" />What then? Do we have an advantage? Not entirely. The fact is, we Jews—and throw in all Westerners too—have
        been pre-indicted for being dominated by sin, <verse eid="ROM 3:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 3:10" />just like it’s recorded in Scripture:

      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 3:19" />Now we know that, to the extent to which the Law of Moses touches on points, it addresses those who’re
        up to their neck in the Law, so that everyone would be left with nothing to say and the entire world
        (i.e., the entire established order of humanity) would become accountable to God. <verse eid="ROM 3:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 3:20" />Therefore, what comes out of works of law (i.e., an attempt to perform the deeds which satisfy the requirements
        mandated by a list of God-given rules) is that not a single living being will be justified before Him
        (i.e., declared “not guilty” in a court of law presided over by God as judge); the fact is, through law
        comes a recognition and a precise knowledge and understanding of sin.<verse eid="ROM 3:20" />

      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 3:25" />whom God determined before it all started to be a propitiation (i.e., a means of redemption) through

        sins <verse eid="ROM 3:25" />
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 3:26" />by the forbearance of God coupled with the demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, resulting

        of the same faith. <verse eid="ROM 3:30" />

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 4:2" />You see, if Abraham was justified (i.e., examined by a judge and declared to be in the right) by works,
        he has bragging-rights (i.e., he has the right to be proud of and brag about his personal achievements);
        but no—not with God. <verse eid="ROM 4:2" />

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 4:9" />So is this blessing upon the circumcised (i.e., those who’ve made a covenant to obey the Law of Moses)
        or the uncircumcised? The fact of the matter is that we say, “The faith peculiar to Abraham was credited
        to him as righteousness.” <verse eid="ROM 4:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 4:10" />So how was it credited? While circumcised or uncircumcised? No—not while circumcised but while uncircumcised,<verse eid="ROM 4:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 4:11" />and after being credited with righteous, he had the actual circumcision operation done to him, a certification
        of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, resulting in him being the progenitor
        of every believer who traverses from uncircumcision (i.e., them being Gentiles and consequently having
        no covenant with God) to their being credited with righteous, <verse eid="ROM 4:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 4:12" />and a progenitor of a circumcised person (i.e., a person who’s Jewish and consequently follows the Law
        of Moses) whose righteousness is not derived from circumcision alone but is a result of following in
        the footsteps of the faith that our patriarch Abraham had while uncircumcised.<verse eid="ROM 4:12" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 4:13" />You see, the promise to Abraham or to his offspring, the promise to be the world’s heir, was not by means
        of law (i.e., a method where one follows a list of rules, with the implication of obtaining righteousness
        from it) but rather through faith-based-righteousness. <verse eid="ROM 4:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 4:14" />To that point, if a law-based methodology is the means by which one lays claim to righteousness and takes
        possession of it, faith has been made null and void, and the promise that was given to Abraham has been
        nullified. <verse eid="ROM 4:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 4:15" />The Law of Moses brings about wrath, you see, but where there is no law (i.e., God-originated list of
        right and wrong), there’s no transgression of that law either.<verse eid="ROM 4:15" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 4:16" />By this method, righteousness comes out of faith, so that it would be dispensed in accordance to grace,
        resulting in the certainty of the promise to all the descendants of Abraham, not only to those who are
        based out of the Law of Moses but also to those who are based out of Abraham’s faith, who is the progenitor
        of us all, <verse eid="ROM 4:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 4:17" />just like it’s written in Scripture, “I have positioned you to be a father (i.e., patriarch, progenitor)
        of every nation and of all Gentiles”…positioning him in plain sight of (and therefore getting the full
        attention of) the One whom he believed: God, the One who makes the dead alive and calls things which
        be not as being. <verse eid="ROM 4:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 4:18" />Contrary to hope but resting upon hope, Abraham believed, resulting in him becoming “a father of many
        nations” according to the quotation, “This is the way your offspring will be.” <verse eid="ROM 4:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 4:19" />Not weakened in faith after fully noticing his own already-lifeless body, which by that time had existed
        for a hundred years or so, and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb, <verse eid="ROM 4:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 4:20" />he didn’t doubt the promise of God by being in unbelief but was strengthened in faith instead, after
        giving glory to God, <verse eid="ROM 4:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 4:21" />convinced that He who promised is able also to do what He promised. <verse eid="ROM 4:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 4:22" />This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” <verse eid="ROM 4:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 4:23" />Now what Scripture says—that righteousness was credited to him—was not written for his sake only, <verse eid="ROM 4:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 4:24" />but for our sake too, those to whom it’s going to be credited, namely to those believing and laying their
        trust upon the resurrected-Jesus—our Lord raised from the dead, <verse eid="ROM 4:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 4:25" />who was handed over and delivered to those who killed him by our sins and was raised by our justification

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 5:6" />You see, while we were still weak, even still at the appointed time Christ died on behalf of ungodly
        people. <verse eid="ROM 5:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 5:7" />You see, there’s hardly a person who will die on behalf of a person who’s righteous; and maybe someone
        will muster the courage to die on behalf of a good person. <verse eid="ROM 5:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 5:8" />But God’s own love is endorsed to us by virtue of the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were
        still sinners. <verse eid="ROM 5:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 5:9" />So now that we’ve been justified by his blood, we’ll all the more be spared from the wrath which is due
        us through him. <verse eid="ROM 5:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 5:10" />You see, if we were reconciled to God through the death of His son while we were enemies, now that we’ve
        been reconciled, we’ll all the more be spared, preserved, and kept intact by his life. <verse eid="ROM 5:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 5:11" />Not only that but we’ll also boast (i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
        through whom we at this time have received the previously stated reconciliation.<verse eid="ROM 5:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 5:12" />Throughout this all, just as sin entered the world through one man and death (i.e., stagnation of waste,
        joylessness, futility, and destruction) through the sin which entered, and in this way death propagated
        to all men, seeing that everybody has sinned— <verse eid="ROM 5:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 5:13" />the fact is, up until law (i.e., an enumeration of God’s commandments) was given, sin was in the world
        (i.e., the established order of human beings), but sin is not transacted and counted against a person
        when law doesn’t exist. <verse eid="ROM 5:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 5:14" />That aside, death reigned from Adam until Moses and it also reigned over those who didn’t sin by committing
        the same transgression that Adam committed, who is a prototype of and symbolic of all human beings who
        come after him.<verse eid="ROM 5:14" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 5:15" />But put that aside. The gift of grace doesn’t operate the same way as the initial transgression: for
        if the many died (i.e., were transformed into a state of spiritual death, resulting in their lives becoming
        a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction—culminating in physical death itself) by
        the single transgression, all the more did the grace of God and the unrequited-gift overflow to the many
        by grace, by the one man Jesus Christ. <verse eid="ROM 5:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 5:16" />But the unrequited-gift doesn’t operate the same way as the affair with the lone person who sinned: on
        the one hand the judicial review which came out of an incident involving a single person resulted in
        condemnation, but on the other hand the grace which came out of many transgressions resulted in an act
        of righteousness.<verse eid="ROM 5:16" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 5:17" />Put another way, if by the transgression of the singular person death reigned through the singular person,
        all the more will they who receive the abundance of the grace of God and the gift of righteousness reign
        in life through the singular person Jesus Christ. <verse eid="ROM 5:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 5:18" />So then, just as condemnation came to every person as the result of one transgression, in the same way
        one act of righteousness resulted in making available to every person the ability of to have the slate
        of his entire life wiped clean. <verse eid="ROM 5:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 5:19" />For just as through the disobedience of the singular person the many were declared by imposition to be

        to be righteous. <verse eid="ROM 5:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 5:20" />But law (i.e., the expectation of living up to the standards imposed by a list of right and wrong) slipped
        in, sneaking in unplanned as though crashing a party, in order that the transgression seeded by Adam
        and propagated to the entire human race would multiply; but if the sin which was seeded multiplied, grace
        multiplied even more so, <verse eid="ROM 5:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 5:21" />so that just as the sin which was seeded reigned by the death that it spawned, in the same way grace
        would reign through righteousness resulting in eternal life (i.e., that special fullness of life, one
        which begins in this lifetime) through our Lord Jesus Christ.<verse eid="ROM 5:21" />

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 6:2" />Don’t even think about it. We—the very people who died (i.e., were transformed into a state of spiritual

        of your flesh (i.e., of your lack of self-ability apart from God; of that part of you which has carnal
        desires; of that part of you which fails to live up to God’s standards). You see, just as you made your
        body parts available to be used as slaves in the filth and degradation of carnality and in an artifact
        of sin, namely the refusal to be restrained by any laws, rules, or codes of conduct, which leads to even
        more of the same, in like fashion make your body parts available at this time to be used as slaves by
        the righteousness which is a consequence of faith which leads to holiness. <verse eid="ROM 6:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 6:20" />The fact is, when you were yet slaves of sin, you were free with respect to living in righteousness.<verse eid="ROM 6:20" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 6:21" />So what final result did you obtain back then, based on the things which you’re now ashamed of? The fact
        of the matter is that those things end in death. <verse eid="ROM 6:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 6:22" />But as things stand now, on the one hand having been freed from the sin inherent in all humans but on
        the other hand having become slaves in God, you’re getting holiness as your final result on the one hand,
        but you end up with eternal life (i.e., that special fullness of life) on the other. <verse eid="ROM 6:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 6:23" />For the wages of the sin inherent in all humans is death, but the gift of God is that special fullness

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 7:1" />Or are you unaware, comrades (and I’m speaking to those of you who’re familiar with the operative details
        of a law-code), that the Law of Moses exercises control over a person only during that person’s lifetime?<verse eid="ROM 7:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 7:2" />To this point, a married woman (who owing to marriage laws is under the authority of her husband, who
        has the legal right to initiate a divorce—but not she) is legally bound to her husband while he’s alive.
        If the husband were to die, then-and-only-then will she be released from her legal constraint to her
        husband. <verse eid="ROM 7:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 7:3" />So then, while her husband’s still alive, she’d be officially labeled an adulteress if she were to get
        married (and therefore under the authority of and bound to) to another man.<verse eid="ROM 7:3" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 7:4" />In the same way, my fellow comrades, through the body of Christ you too have been put to death in relation
        to the Law of Moses resulting in you having come into being under the authority of and bound to another—to
        him who’s been raised from the dead—in order that you would produce aftereffects in God. <verse eid="ROM 7:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 7:5" />You see, when you were in the flesh (i.e., trying in and of yourself to live up to God’s rules while
        at the same time beholden to your carnal nature), the passions of the sins pervasive to mankind, those
        things that, on account of the Law, were repeatedly at work in our body parts (i.e., your personal carnal
        signature) resulting in the production of aftereffects in death (i.e., in a stagnation of waste, joylessness,
        futility, and destruction).<verse eid="ROM 7:5" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 7:6" />But as things stand now, we’ve been released from the Law of Moses, having died to that which kept holding
        us down, so that we serve in newness of spirit (i.e. walking in line with and dominated by a regenerated
        human spirit, which is in communion with the Holy Spirit) and not oldness of letter (i.e., a strict,
        literal, exacting interpretation of the verbatim Law of Moses, along with a grueling, rigid adherence
        done the “old way”—out of a person’s self-ability).<verse eid="ROM 7:6" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 7:7" />So what’s there to say about this? Are we to conclude that the Law of Moses is characteristic of and
        has the quality and nature of sin?—Don’t even think about it—on the contrary I would not have come to
        know, recognize, and understand the sin pervasive to mankind if not through law (i.e., by conducting
        my life under the weight of a long list of God-ordained rules); for indeed I would’ve come to know this
        first-hand had not the Law of Moses kept on telling me over and over, “Thou shalt not covet such-and-such.”<verse eid="ROM 7:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 7:8" />Sin took advantage of the situation through the commandment “thou shalt not covet” and worked utterly
        in me every sort of coveting imaginable: you see, apart from law (i.e., being forced to obey a list of
        rules) sin is dead. <verse eid="ROM 7:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 7:9" />In the past I was alive and living apart from law; but the commandment came and the sin of coveting which
        I just mentioned sprang to life; <verse eid="ROM 7:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 7:10" />I died. It became evident in me that the commandment—the same one leading to life—was leading to death.<verse eid="ROM 7:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 7:11" />To be more specific, the sin of coveting through the commandment took advantage of the situation, fooled
        me completely, and killed me (i.e., caused me to die spiritually) by this. <verse eid="ROM 7:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 7:12" />Consequently, the Law of Moses is indeed holy, and the commandment “thou shalt not covet” is holy and
        just and good.<verse eid="ROM 7:12" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 7:13" />So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?—Don’t even think about it; on the
        contrary, in order that the nature and devastation of sin would become apparent, sin utterly worked death
        through the good in me, so that the sin of coveting would reach its maximal efficacy through the commandment
        “thou shalt not covet.” <verse eid="ROM 7:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 7:14" />You see, we know for a fact that the Law is intrinsically spiritual; I am fleshly (i.e., the nature of
        my physical body is that it is susceptible to carnal temptations, and that part of me does not want to
        serve God), having been sold by the sin pervasive to mankind: <verse eid="ROM 7:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 7:15" />I don’t understand nor do I recognize what it is that I’m getting done; the fact of the matter is, I’m
        not putting into practice what I want—I’m doing what I hate instead. <verse eid="ROM 7:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 7:16" />But if I’m doing what I don’t want to, I concur with the Law of Moses, concurring that it’s good. <verse eid="ROM 7:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 7:17" />At this point, though, it’s no longer me personally accomplishing this but rather the sin which inhabits
        me.<verse eid="ROM 7:17" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 7:18" />You see, I know for a fact that good does not inhabit me, that is, in my flesh (i.e. in my human, carnal
        nature); for the wanting is present in me, at hand ready to jump in, but getting the good done is not
        happening. <verse eid="ROM 7:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 7:19" />In fact, I’m not doing the good that I want to do, but instead, I’m doing the bad which I don’t want
        to do and doing it on a day-to-day basis. <verse eid="ROM 7:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 7:20" />Now if what I don’t want to do is the thing that I’m doing, It’s no longer me producing the finished
        product but the sin which inhabits me is producing it instead. <verse eid="ROM 7:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 7:21" />I’m discovering the Law of God (i.e., the principle that one should do right and live according to God’s
        will), then, with the wanting in me to do the good, because the bad is present in me, ready to rear its
        ugly head; <verse eid="ROM 7:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 7:22" />you see, I delight in the Law of God with respect to the inner-person, <verse eid="ROM 7:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 7:23" />but I see another law (i.e., a different principle) in my body parts (i.e., in my unique carnal signature)
        waging war against the law of my mind (i.e. against the principles by which my mind operate), defeating
        me and making me a prisoner of the sin which exists in my body parts. <verse eid="ROM 7:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 7:24" />What a miserable person I am: who’ll rescue me from this body which is rooted in death?— <verse eid="ROM 7:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 7:25" />God is so good through Jesus Christ our Lord!—So then me—on the one hand I’m enslaved in mind to a law
        of God (i.e., to a principle set in place by God), but on the other hand I’m enslaved in flesh to a law
        of sin (i.e., to a principle of sin caused by carnality).<verse eid="ROM 7:25" />

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 8:1" />Therefore, there’s nothing of condemnation now with those in Christ Jesus: <verse eid="ROM 8:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 8:2" />The law of the spirit of life (i.e., the principle of living a spiritual life in communion with the Holy
        Spirit) set you free from the law of the sin which afflicts mankind and the ensuing death (i.e. the principle
        of sin coming about due to our human nature and the resulting stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility,
        and destruction). <verse eid="ROM 8:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 8:3" />You see, the inability of the Law of Moses in that it was continually weak through the flesh (i.e., through
        human ability alone apart from God and aggravated by human carnality), God sent His very-own son in sinful-flesh
        form and, in regard to sin, condemned the sin in the flesh, <verse eid="ROM 8:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 8:4" />so that the decrees of the Law of Moses would be fulfilled in us, in those who’re not going about their
        day-to-day business according to flesh (i.e., according to their own ability apart from God and according
        to their carnal nature) but rather according to spirit (i.e., according to a spiritual life, a life in
        communion with the Holy Spirit). <verse eid="ROM 8:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 8:5" />For those whose existence is in accordance with the nature of the flesh think about the things of the

        the things of the Spirit. <verse eid="ROM 8:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 8:6" />The fact of the matter is that the flesh-mindset is death; the mindset of the spirit is life and peace.<verse eid="ROM 8:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 8:7" />Therefore, the mindset of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it doesn’t submit to the Law of God; in fact,
        it can’t do so: <verse eid="ROM 8:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 8:8" />Those existing in flesh can’t please God.<verse eid="ROM 8:8" />

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 8:9" />You aren’t in flesh (i.e., live out of your natural ability and through your carnal nature) but in spirit
        (i.e., live out of a regenerated human spirit in communion with the Holy Spirit), if God’s Spirit in
        fact dwells in you. (If a given person doesn’t have Christ’s Spirit, that person’s not a part of him
        and from him.) <verse eid="ROM 8:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 8:10" />Now if Christ is in you—yes—the body is dead through sin, but the spirit has life and is alive through
        righteousness. <verse eid="ROM 8:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 8:11" />If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you all, He who raised Jesus from the

      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 8:13" />If you live according to flesh, you’re going to die (i.e., experience spiritual death), you see; but
        if by spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you’re going to live. <verse eid="ROM 8:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 8:14" />The fact is, any people—any people at all—who’re led by the Spirit of God: these people are sons of God.<verse eid="ROM 8:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 8:15" />In fact, you have not received a spirit (i.e., a prevailing disposition) of slavery resulting in fear
        again; instead, you’ve received a spirit of adoption, one with which we cry out, “Papa! Father!” <verse eid="ROM 8:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 8:16" />The Spirit himself in conjunction with our spirit jointly declares that we are children of God. <verse eid="ROM 8:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 8:17" />If children, heirs too—heirs of God indeed; joint-heirs of Christ’s inheritance, if indeed we jointly-suffer

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 8:18" />Regarding this point, I figure that the present-day sufferings aren’t even in the same ballpark as the
        glory that’s going to be revealed to us. <verse eid="ROM 8:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 8:19" />In fact, the creation is in suspense waiting for the sons of God to break onto the scene. <verse eid="ROM 8:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 8:20" />You see, the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly of course—no—it was subjected on account
        of whoever or whatever subjected it, resting upon hope <verse eid="ROM 8:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 8:21" />that the creation itself will be set free from the slavery of corruption (a corruption like decomposing
        organic matter) over to the freedom of the sons of God. <verse eid="ROM 8:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 8:22" />Regarding this, we know from first-hand experience that every bit of the creation moans and groans in
        unison and is in agony in unison from the time it was first corrupted up to now. <verse eid="ROM 8:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 8:23" />Not only does the creation moan, groan, and agonize but so do those who have a token sample of celebration
        of the Spirit—namely us—we too moan and groan within ourselves in suspense waiting for an adoption, the
        redemption of our body (i.e., the restoration of the body to its original purpose and function and the
        elimination of the carnal nature). <verse eid="ROM 8:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 8:24" />In fact, we were saved by hope; hope which is seen (i.e., is of something which verifiably exists in
        the physical world) isn’t hope—just who hopes for what he sees? <verse eid="ROM 8:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 8:25" />Now if we hope for what we don’t see, we’re in suspense awaiting it, exercising perseverance throughout.<verse eid="ROM 8:25" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 8:26" />In the same way, the Spirit helps us (i.e., he gets ahold of something in unison with us against that
        something) with our weakness: you see, we don’t know how we must pray or what we must pray; instead of
        us being constrained by that limitation, when he intercedes on behalf of others, the Spirit himself intercedes
        (i.e., he personally acts on another’s behalf by joining up with him in order to obtain a goal, to hit
        the mark like an arrow hitting its target, like a baseball player who gets a good solid hit on a ball
        putting it in the spot he’s chosen) with moans and groans which can’t be put into speech. <verse eid="ROM 8:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 8:27" />The one who searches the hearts knows for a fact the thoughts, opinions, and intentions of the Spirit,
        since he intercedes on behalf of people set apart for God. <verse eid="ROM 8:27" />
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 8:28" />We know for a fact that God works all things in unison towards a good goal for them who love God, those
        who exist as the according-to-purpose called-ones, <verse eid="ROM 8:28" />
      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 8:29" />since they whom He foreknew (i.e., knew one’s individual personality, nature, and spiritual acuity before
        it became apparent), he foreordained to conform to the image of His son, resulting in him being firstborn
        among many comrades and brothers. <verse eid="ROM 8:29" />
      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 8:30" />Those whom He foreordained, He also called (i.e., summoned to believe in Him). And those He called, He
        also justified (i.e., declared “not guilty”); those He justified, He also glorified.<verse eid="ROM 8:30" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 8:31" />So what’s the takeaway?—If God’s on our side, who’s on the opposing team? <verse eid="ROM 8:31" />
      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 8:32" />He who certainly didn’t spare His own son, but surrendered him to crucifixion on behalf of us all, how
        will He not freely and willingly give us all things? <verse eid="ROM 8:32" />
      <verse number="33" style="v" sid="ROM 8:33" />Who will press charges against those chosen by God, those in God’s church? God’s doing the justifying

      <verse number="34" style="v" sid="ROM 8:34" />who’s issuing the guilty verdicts? Is the person who’s issuing the guilty verdicts Christ Jesus, the
        fellow who died, but—beyond that—was resurrected? The fellow who’s also God’s chief executive, the fellow
        who also intercedes on our behalf? <verse eid="ROM 8:34" />
      <verse number="35" style="v" sid="ROM 8:35" />What will separate us from the love of Christ—tribulation…distress…persecution…famine…nakedness…danger…sword

      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 10:1" />Comrades, my heart’s good intentions towards my fellow Israelites and my prayer to God when I pray for
        them are targeted towards their salvation (i.e., their being rescued from spiritual, moral, mental, and
        physical calamity). <verse eid="ROM 10:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 10:2" />Furthermore, I do declare that they have a zeal for God, but not a zeal in which they arrive at an understanding

      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 10:3" />For while being ignorant of the righteousness of God and while seeking to erect their own righteousness,
        they didn’t put themselves in subjection to the righteousness of God. <verse eid="ROM 10:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 10:4" />You see, for all those who have faith and believe, Christ puts an end to law (i.e., the method of living

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 10:5" />In fact, Moses writes about the righteousness which comes out of law, stating that, “Those things which

      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 10:6" />But the righteousness which comes from the perspective of faith puts things this way: Don’t say in your

      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 10:7" />“Who will descend into the abyss (i.e., the world of the dead; the place of eternal identity-loss)” (that

      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 10:10" />You see, the word is believed with the heart, and the end-result is righteousness; the word is confessed

      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 10:11" />To this point, the Old Testament says:

        it’s wrong for the person who sees a particular food as an item of temptation and as something that is
        sinful to eat. <verse eid="ROM 14:20" />
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 14:21" />The practice of not eating meat, drinking wine, or indulging in something which your fellow comrade believes
        to be sinful is laudable. <verse eid="ROM 14:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 14:22" />Keep your personal beliefs between you and God. Blessed is he who’s not having to decide for himself

      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 14:23" />But he who’s weighing point and counterpoint deciding if he’d chance eating some food has already reached
        the point where he’s condemned (i.e., objectively guilty of wrong-doing), since that’s not a product
        of faith. Anything which is not a product of faith is a sin.<verse eid="ROM 14:23" />
