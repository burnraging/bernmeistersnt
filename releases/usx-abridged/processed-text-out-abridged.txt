     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To this point, from the inception of human society, His invisible aspects (that is, His everlasting power|
     v20                                |and divine nature) have been clearly seen and understood by means of the things which were created, resulting|

 +   V24              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So for the aforementioned reasons, as they were wallowing in the desires of their hearts, God handed|

     v27                                |for one another, men perpetrating the disgraceful deed with men and receiving the corresponding reward|
     v27                                |which they have coming to them and which they were bound to receive due to their error, an error which|

 +   V28              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |And just as they did not approve of retaining the accumulated knowledge and understanding of God, God|

     v 1                                |of a law-code), that the Law of Moses exercises control over a person only during that person’s lifetime?|
     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To this point, a married woman (who owing to marriage laws is under the authority of her husband, who|
     v 2                                |has the legal right to initiate a divorce—but not she) is legally bound to her husband while he’s alive.|

     v 4                                |to the Law of Moses resulting in you having come into being under the authority of and bound to another—to|
     v 4                                |him who’s been raised from the dead—in order that you would produce aftereffects in God. |
     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, when you were in the flesh (i.e., trying in and of yourself to live up to God’s rules while|
     v 5                                |at the same time beholden to your carnal nature), the passions of the sins pervasive to mankind, those|

     v 5                                |signature) resulting in the production of aftereffects in death (i.e., in a stagnation of waste, joylessness,|

     v 6                                |human spirit, which is in communion with the Holy Spirit) and not oldness of letter (i.e., a strict,|

     v 7                                |has the quality and nature of sin?—Don’t even think about it—on the contrary I would not have come to|
     v 7                                |know, recognize, and understand the sin pervasive to mankind if not through law (i.e., by conducting|
     v 7                                |my life under the weight of a long list of God-ordained rules); for indeed I would’ve come to know this|

     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Sin took advantage of the situation through the commandment “thou shalt not covet” and worked utterly|
     v 8                                |in me every sort of coveting imaginable: you see, apart from law (i.e., being forced to obey a list of|
     v 8                                |rules) sin is dead. |
     V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In the past I was alive and living apart from law; but the commandment came and the sin of coveting which|
     v 9                                |I just mentioned sprang to life; |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I died. It became evident in me that the commandment—the same one leading to life—was leading to death.|
     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To be more specific, the sin of coveting through the commandment took advantage of the situation, fooled|
     v11                                |me completely, and killed me (i.e., caused me to die spiritually) by this. |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Consequently, the Law of Moses is indeed holy, and the commandment “thou shalt not covet” is holy and|

 +   V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?—Don’t even think about it; on the|
     v13                                |contrary, in order that the nature and devastation of sin would become apparent, sin utterly worked death|
     v13                                |through the good in me, so that the sin of coveting would reach its maximal efficacy through the commandment|

     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, we know for a fact that the Law is intrinsically spiritual; I am fleshly (i.e., the nature of|

     v18                                |nature); for the wanting is present in me, at hand ready to jump in, but getting the good done is not|

     V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, I’m not doing the good that I want to do, but instead, I’m doing the bad which I don’t want|
     v19                                |to do and doing it on a day-to-day basis. |

     v21                                |will), then, with the wanting in me to do the good, because the bad is present in me, ready to rear its|

     v 2                                |Spirit) set you free from the law of the sin which afflicts mankind and the ensuing death (i.e. the principle|

     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, the one who speaks in tongues isn’t talking to people when he’s speaking in tongues but is talking|
     v 2                                |to God instead. In fact no one hears him speak intelligibly: he speaks mysteries by his spirit. |

     V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So what’s the conclusion? I will pray in the Spirit, but I will pray also with the mind. I will sing|
     v15                                |a song of praise to the Lord in the Spirit, but I will also sing a song with the mind. |

     V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |but putting that to the side, when I’m in a church I want to speak five words or so using my mind so|

 +   V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Then after spending fourteen years away, I went back down to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along|

     v 6                                |makes no difference to me: God doesn’t give a hoot about a person’s status, outward appearance, or public|

     v17                                |be invalidated by a law-code which came into being 430 years after the will was notarized resulting in|

 +   V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So where does the Law of Moses fit in to all of this? It was added as an agency of grace and mercy which|
     v19                                |overlooks the transgressions which would inevitably occur, until the time when the father-to-son direct|
     v19                                |descendant happens to arrive, the one whom the promise was given to. The Law was ordained, established,|
     v19                                |and set in order through angels and physically carried out by the hand of a priest acting in the role|

     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But the intermediary is not one, but God is One (i.e., the intermediary isn’t an incomparable, all-wise,|
     v20                                |all-encompassing, single-minded being, one who is the end-all of everything, but God is just that).|
 +   V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So is the Law of Moses compatible with the promises?—Don’t even think such a thought. You see, if a law-code|

     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, this is the will of God (your holiness is the will of God!): it is for you to abstain from the|

     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The fact of the matter is that God has not called you to uncleanness (i.e., God’s intention for your|

 +   V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Now the first covenant regulated and maintained a service of religious rituals and the systematic order|
     v 1                                |of what is deemed holy. |
     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, the outer sanctuary was prepared in such a way that it contained the menorah and the Table of|
     v 2                                |Showbread. This outer sanctuary is called the Holy Place. |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But behind a curtain is the second sanctuary, which is called the Holy of Holies, |
     V 4              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |having a golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant, the ark being completely wrapped in a gold|
     v 4                                |covering. Inside the ark is a golden vase which contained the sample of manna saved from the time of|
     v 4                                |wandering in the wilderness, Aaron’s rod which budded, and the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments,|
     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and situated above the ark overshadowing the mercy seat were cherubim of God’s glory—things we won’t|
     v 5                                |go into a piece-by-piece description of at this time.|
 +   V 6              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Now things were set up this way: throughout the year, the priests periodically entered the outer sanctuary|
     v 6                                |in order to make sure the required rituals were done, |
     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |but just one time a year the high priest entered the inner sanctuary, but not without taking blood with|
     v 7                                |him, blood that he offered on behalf of himself and on behalf of the sins that the folk-people unknowingly|
     v 7                                |committed. |
     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |This is what the Holy Spirit is signifying: while the outer sanctuary still exists and is being actively|
     v 8                                |used, the way into the Holy of Holies has not yet been revealed, |
     V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |a particular concept which is analogous to the period of time which has arrived and is presently in operation,|
     v 9                                |which according to this analogy means that the offering up of offerings and sacrifices is powerless to|
     v 9                                |bring those performing the rituals to completeness along the lines of conscience; |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |the regulations involved with eating, drinking, various kinds of ceremonial washings were physical and|
     v10                                |self-originated acts only, imposed until a period of reform happened to arrive and change things.|
 +   V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Christ showed up as a high priest of the good things which came into being because of the greater and|
     v11                                |more perfect tabernacle, which is not hand-made (in other words, not of this planet). |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |It was not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood that he entered once and for all into|
     v12                                |the Holy of Holies and obtained eternal release and deliverance from sin. |
     V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, if the blood of bulls and goats and the sprinkling of the ashes of an incinerated heifer make|
     v13                                |those who’ve been defiled pristine and undefiled again to the producing of the purity of the flesh, |
     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish|
     v14                                |to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works resulting in you serving the Living God?|
 +   V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Because of this, he’s the mediator of a new covenant, so that, considering that a death occurred for|
     v15                                |the redemption (i.e., the settling of something; fixing what’s broken) of the transgressions which were|
     v15                                |committed under the first covenant, those who’ve been called to be God’s people would partake of the|
     v15                                |eternal inheritance (i.e., the things God has immutably and irrevocably reserved for them and intended|
     v15                                |for them to have). |
     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The fact of the matter is that where a last will and testament (which is what a covenant is) is concerned,|
     v16                                |it’s necessary that the death of the will’s testator be proven legally. |
     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, upon the death of the testator the will is frozen as-is and can no longer be amended in any|
     v17                                |way; it never has that immutability-strength while the testator is still alive and therefore able to|
     v17                                |amend it at any time. |
     V18              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Hence, the first covenant was not instituted apart from the inclusion of blood. |
     V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, once every commandment in the Law was spoken to all the people by Moses, taking the blood of|
     v19                                |calves and goats mixed with water, red wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled the scroll he read from itself|
     v19                                |and all the people |
     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |while saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you to keep.&quot; |
     V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In addition he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the serving vessels used in the rituals in blood the|
     v21                                |same way. |
     V22              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |It’s almost as though it’s an Old Testament axiom that according to the Law of Moses everything is purified|
     v22                                |and cleansed by blood, and apart from the shedding of blood any sort of forgiveness of sin doesn’t happen.|
 +   V23              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |While the copies of the things in the spirit-world (i.e., the copies being the earthly tabernacle and|
     v23                                |items in it) need to be cleansed by these things (i.e., by the blood of calves, of goats, etc.), but|
     v23                                |the actual things in the spirit-world that the earthly things are a copy of require better sacrifices|
     v23                                |than the ones offered on earth. |
     V24              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, Christ didn’t enter a Holy of Holies that was created by human hands, these man-made things|
     v24                                |merely being symbolic representations and mirror-copies of the real things, but instead entered into|
     v24                                |the same thing (i.e., the thing which the symbolic representations are based on) which is in the spirit-world,|
     v24                                |to be seen by, to be known by, and to be subjected to God’s intense scrutiny on our behalf. |
     V25              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Nor is it the case that he repetitively brings himself into this Holy of Holies in the spirit-world just|
     v25                                |like the high priest enters the earthly Holy of Holies each year with another batch of blood to be sprinkled.|
     V26              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |If that were the case, he would have to suffer and die on the cross many times starting the moment the|
     v26                                |human race began; but at this this critical moment in the annuls of history, he appeared this once for|
     v26                                |the obliteration of the sin of mankind because of his sacrifice having been disclosed and made known|
     v26                                |to everyone. |
     V27              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |And reflective of the fact that it’s been allocated that every person in the human race undergo death|
     v27                                |once and only once and after this undergo judgment, |
     V28              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |in the same way as this, Christ, having been brought forth one time only for the purpose of being offered|
     v28                                |up for the sins of the many, will be seen a second time apart from sin (i.e., he’ll make a second appearance,|
     v28                                |and this appearance will have nothing to do with atoning for sins) by those who assiduously and eagerly|
     v28                                |look to him for salvation (i.e., look to him to protect them from potential harm, whatever that might|
     v28                                |be).|

     v 1                                |the things’ shadow, by the same sacrifices that are continuously being offered year after year can never|

     v 2                                |would have no more sins on their consciences once they had been cleansed? |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |No—in doing those things year after year, there’s a reminder of sins that need to be cleansed. |

     V 9 VERSES_NON_INDENTED_NARRATIVE: |Then he said, “‘Hey, I have come…to do Your will.” He gets the first (i.e., the sacrifices, offerings,|
