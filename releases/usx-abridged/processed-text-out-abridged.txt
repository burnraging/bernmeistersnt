                                        |judge</char>. (Also, ref. note of Luke 6:37.) The word <char style="it">judge </char>as used in the Bible|
                                        |means one of the following: ascertaining guilt or innocence, in or out of an actual courtroom; the verdict|
                                        |reached from such deliberation; the resulting sentence; a combination of these. This is evident upon|
                                        |examining how the word is used in both the OT and NT. In the case of 7:1 here, judging refers to the|
                                        |verdict reached from deliberation but does not refer to the ascertaining of guilt or innocence; hence,|
                                        |the misunderstanding of what Jesus is saying here. Many who read “don’t judge” here in 7:1 understand|
                                        |it to mean that Christians should refrain from ascertaining guilt or innocence, i.e. they shouldn’t decide|
                                        |whether another person’s deeds are moral or immoral, and to make such decisions brings judgment upon|
                                        |ourselves. Not only does this contradict common sense but it’s not consistent with other teaching of|
                                        |the NT. It’s the case of building a doctrine on one verse of Scripture and not taking all of Scripture|
                                        |into consideration. Those who wrote the NT lived in the times of Jesus and were either spent much time|
                                        |around him (and conversed in the same native language), were taught directly by him, or had contact with|
                                        |those who did. Had Jesus meant that Christians shouldn’t ascertain moral guilt or innocence of others,|
                                        |then their writers would reflect that. But their writings do not. In other words, Paul’s epistles violate|
                                        |the notion that “don’t judge” means one shouldn’t look at another Christian and decide if what they’re|
                                        |doing is right or wrong. For example, Paul wrote these statements in 1 Cor. 5, <char style="it">For I|
                                        |verily as absent in body but present in spirit, hath judged already, as though I were present, concerning|

                                        |if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard,|

                                        |to leprosy applies to many hygienic, etc. conditions. In the NT, the concepts of clean and unclean are|
                                        |extended to spiritual conditions. But in this passage, the leper must be certified (the certification|
                                        |additionally requiring a sacrificial offering) as clean by a priest in order to be readmitted back into|
                                        |society. Should he have but a little leprosy, he’ll fail certification; the leper is therefore asking|
                                        |for a total removal of the leprosy.|

                                        |etc. In the Bible the phrase <char style="it">son of</char> means someone who’s a perfect example, who|

                                        |many years for him to pass away.) After all, one of the Ten Commandments is to honor your mother and|

                                        |but when that man resists it or when it’s cast out of him. He travels over “uninhabitable, inhospitable|

                                        |for another person to inhabit, which is what is meant in v. 43 by “seeking residency” (literally, <char|

                                        |advances of that demon. Having been rejected by others, in v. 44 the demon returns to his original host|

                                        |etc. In this case, there’s a lot of tools, machinery, storage containers, etc. that are buried in closets,|
                                        |warehouses, etc. The manager had been there for years and had known about every item which was made or|
                                        |purchased, what condition it’s in, and where it’s stored. So, for example, if on the farm they need to|
                                        |lift a heavy rock or something, he thinks for a while and then tells everyone, “There’s and old rope|

                                        |the rock.” That analogy is applied to the Scribe. He had done all this study and learned the ins and|
                                        |outs of many verses of Scriptures, so when his heart turns to the Lord, he’s able to retrieve old pieces|

                                        |was needed at the time. Elijah’s miracles were the send-down-fire-from-the-sky type. God performed those|
                                        |kinds of miracles in Elijah’s time (i.e., Elijah’s season or Elijah’s dispensation) because that was|
                                        |what was needed or appropriate for that season. God was performing through Jesus mostly healing miracles,|
                                        |as the season had changed from that of Elijah’s to a season of the mercy of God. The miracles in Jesus’s|
                                        |ministry were of a different nature than Elijah’s, but the Pharisees expected Jesus to vindicate himself|
                                        |through Elijah-type miracles. The Pharisees were demanding a miracle that was relevant to Elijah’s dispensation|
                                        |and would not recognize a miracle which was relevant to Jesus’s dispensation. They could look at the|
                                        |sky, noting the time of day and the weather season, and know what kind of weather to expect, but could|
                                        |not differentiate what miracle was appropriate for the time they lived in.|

                                        |back from the dead as he said he would. Jesus is saying that he won’t do any miracle on-demand except|
                                        |for that singular miracle of coming back from the dead. In reality, Jesus did miracles all the time,|
                                        |and the Pharisees could have just followed him around and saw one, but the Pharisees wouldn’t accept|

                                        |vv. 9, 10 is repeated Mark 9:17. The lesson is the same: in both miracles of multiplication, the disciples|
                                        |finished with the same number of baskets as when they started. For that matter, had they fed more, they|
                                        |still would have finished with the same number of baskets as they started. The food was not multiplied|
                                        |when Jesus gave thanks before the meal. Jesus did not pray and a heap of food appeared. Instead, the|
                                        |miracle occurred each time a disciple reached his hand into a basket to hand out more food. The food|
                                        |was multiplied on-the-spot over and over again, as many times as was needed. The point Jesus makes is|
                                        |that God’s provision for our daily bread happens on-the-spot, right when it’s needed, as many times as|
                                        |it’s needed, and not provided in a large lump beforehand. Jesus is impressing on them the fact that if|
                                        |they were to need more food, it would appear the moment it was needed, and that they shouldn’t worry|
                                        |about it.|

                                        |he is a rock. Some disagree as to the interpretation of this verse. Some point to Gk. lectionaries and|
                                        |say that petros is a different word than petra, that petros means a rock fragment, that while Peter is|
                                        |the rock fragment, Jesus himself is the petra. The other argument says that petros is the Gk. word petra|
                                        |converted into its name form. I should point out that this second argument is more plausible, for the|
                                        |reason that the attributive adjective construct of the word <char style="it">this</char> in the Gk.,|

                                        |to its antecedent petra, and therefore they are one in the same. It’s worth pointing out that James supplanted|
                                        |Peter in the leadership of the Jewish church in the years following Pentecost.|

                                        |the result, but nevertheless, an attempt is made. As it was in ancient times, so it was up until the|
                                        |last century or so, than coins were tethered to their intrinsic value in gold or silver. The average|
                                        |biblical commentator did simple conversions based on the value of silver. But this does not give meaningful|
                                        |results, as the leaps in industrial productivity have made silver relatively plentiful compared to ancient|
                                        |times. The cost of silver in today’s US dollars is around $0.76/gram—but that in no way reflects the|
                                        |purchasing power of silver today verses silver in ancient times. A more accurate method for conversion|
                                        |is to base it on the cost of unskilled labor. Even that varies enormously between industrialized nations|
                                        |and non-industrialized nations. The cost of labor in ancient times can be ascertained from Matt. 20:2,|
                                        |which is namely 1 denarius (4g silver) per day. In US in the 19<char style="sup">th</char> century, a|
                                        |day’s labor went for around $0.80, which was around 18g of silver, or 4.5 times more silver per day than|
                                        |what a worker in ancient times received—which demonstrates the inadequacy of simple conversions based|
                                        |on the price of gold or silver. But if one assumes that an unskilled worker makes $12/hour nowadays in|
                                        |industrialized nations, and therefore is paid $100 per day, then a denarius would represent $100 in today’s|
                                        |purchasing power. Of course, in contemporary, non-industrialized nations, the price of labor per day|
                                        |might be $5–$10, which is substantially less than industrialized nations. So the 100 denarrii equate|
                                        |to $10,000 of purchasing power in industrialized nations, but only $500 in non-industrialized nations.|

                                        |His wedding outfit. The bad folk in v.10 who were invited were given the proper clothing to wear, meaning|

                                        |Jesus in this verse is referring to the ones who have been invited to the wedding. In other words, the|

                                        |refers to those who in v.8 qualify (are worthy). Jesus is saying that many are invited to the wedding|
                                        |but only a few show up and are dressed properly when they do. In that light, God is not arbitrarily choosing|

                                        |for food. So it was when the Spirit descended: a lot of activity and commotion, but once the Spirit came|
                                        |to rest on Jesus, the commotion ceased. But like the pigeon, the Spirit remained.|

                                        |is that grape juice is simply wine which hasn’t fermented yet; freshly-squeezed grape juice will invariably|

                                        |and since the skins are sealed shut, such gases cause an increase in pressure, which causes a new skin|
                                        |to stretch, and therefore the total volume in the sealed container to increase, thereby reducing the|
                                        |pressure. Old skins, those which have been used once already for making wine, have been stretched fully|
                                        |and do not shrink after the wine has been poured out of them. When grape juice is fermented in them a|

                                        |evil spirits are an entire supernatural race of a sort. The phrase <char style="it">unclean spirit </char>emphasizes|

                                        |points to a foundational leadership position in the Church. This list of apostles here in Mark 3 ranks|
                                        |them according to the preeminence Jesus assigns to them. Therefore, in listing Peter first and giving|
                                        |him the name Peter (”the rock”), Jesus has made Peter the first among his disciples and the one who’ll|

                                        |stated this in the context of the way Satan and his demons operate. This verse is one of the most important|
                                        |rules for understanding how demons take hold of people. What Jesus is saying is that it is not possible|
                                        |for demons to simply approach someone and take control of them, believers and unbelievers alike. In order|
                                        |for evil spirits to get any sort of control over a person, they must break that person’s will first.|
                                        |Breaking their will is “binding the strong man.” Only then, can they “enter the strong man’s house.”|
                                        |A person who is fully demon-possessed has had his willpower systematically broken, and for this reason,|
                                        |someone must cast the demon out of him, since he has not the willpower to do it himself. However, any|
                                        |believer can simply exercise his will and authority in Christ and drive any demonic influence from himself.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">blaspheme the Holy Spirit…</char>Jesus says that this one sin called “the blasphemy|
                                        |of the Holy Spirit” is unforgiveable. Jesus spoke of the same thing in Matt. 12:32 (ref. note there).|
                                        |What exactly, then, is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? The answer is in plain sight, as Jesus was insinuating|
                                        |that the Scribes had committed this sin, and what the Scribes did is specified in v.30. Here the Scribes|
                                        |could see the miracles of Jesus, and they attributed them to the devil. Believing in miracles does not|
                                        |require the amount of faith as believing in something which is unseen does. The hardness of heart that|
                                        |denies the undeniable will never turn to God and will therefore never receive forgiveness, ever.|

                                        |fig season and as a result cursed the tree. Why did Jesus expect to find figs on a tree when it wasn’t|
                                        |fig season? There are two times a year in which a fig tree bears figs. The main crop is in the late summer|
                                        |or fall and a secondary crop (called a <char style="it">breba</char>) is in the spring. The breba crop|
                                        |comes from shoots from the previous fall’s crop. Also, over the winter a fig tree will shed leaves. New|
                                        |leaves grow back in the spring, and this is what the phrase <char style="it">in leaf</char> refers to|
                                        |in v. 13. Also, the appearance of these new leaves coincides with the breba crop; hence, Jesus saw the|
                                        |new leaves and expected to see figs. When Mark said in v.13 that “figs weren’t in season,” he’s referring|

                                        |A couple of relevant facts concerning the Gk. grammar in this short statement. First, the verb tense|
                                        |(present) of <char style="it">have </char>insinuates not just having once and being done with it but|
                                        |having continuously. Second, the lack of the definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>is|
                                        |conspicuous and was omitted intentionally by Mark. As a point of contrast, consider the example of Acts|
                                        |3:16, where the definite article is used before <char style="it">faith</char> (and this in a prepositional|
                                        |phrase, which often omits an expected definite article). In the case of v. 22 here, the omission of the|
                                        |definite article emphasizes the nature of the faith. Furthermore, the word <char style="it">God </char>is|
                                        |in the genitive case, but when a possessive is constructed in Gk. (an example in English would be, “This|
                                        |is Mary’s jar,” where <char style="it">Mary </char>appears in the possessive form), it normally consists|
                                        |of the definite article first, followed by the noun, followed by perhaps another article, then the genitive|
                                        |form of the noun doing the possessing. Since the initial definite article is missing, this disrupts the|
                                        |normal pattern of a Gk. possessive form, and signals a different meaning to the reader. Third, the lack|
                                        |of definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>emphasizes the nature of the faith.|

                                        |is in v. 23: some manuscripts have inserted the word <char style="it">to</char>, changing it from: <char|

                                        |more important duties. The doorman’s temptation is to neglect his night watch duties, as the servants,|
                                        |those senior to him, will sleep through the night and therefore not keep tabs on him. The admonition|

                                        |what he’s doing. Furthermore, he often uses the name <char style="it">Peter</char>, the one given to|

                                        |fit Mark’s style of writing and his use of vocabulary. Their claims:|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(a) <char style="it">Mary Magdalene, whom he had cast out seven demons</char> (v.9). They claim that|
                                        |the writer is introducing Mary Magdalene here, noting the demons cast out of her, but in fact she had|
                                        |been referred to just a few times in the preceding verses and chapters.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(b) Some words occur in this passage that Mark doesn’t use anywhere else|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(c) The writing is simply not Mark’s style|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Let us look at these claims in detail.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |First, Mark mentions that Mary Magdalene had had seven demons cast out of her. Any forger would know|
                                        |that Mary Magdalene was brought up in v.1 and would’ve written accordingly. But the extra statement of|
                                        |her having demons cast out is not an introduction but a reminder of the grace she had received, resulting|
                                        |in a tender heart which caused her to be the first to believe when the others wouldn’t. To emphasize|
                                        |this, Mark, when he said <char style="it">had cast out</char>, chose to use the Gk. perfect tense over|
                                        |the aorist for emphasis. In support of this, v.10 begins with the words <char style="it">that lady</char>,|
                                        |which invites the reader to detach himself and ponder her history. The other women weren’t address in|
                                        |that fashion.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Second, there are a few words which Mark uses in this passage that don’t appear elsewhere in his book|
                                        |(never mind the fact that every chapter of Mark has unique words used in its chapter which Mark uses|
                                        |nowhere else). Let us look at these words:|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(i) <char style="it">Accompany</char> (v.17). This is a more specific word that pre-pends the word <char|
                                        |style="it">with </char>to <char style="it">follow. </char>Certainly Mark knew the meaning of this word.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(ii) <char style="it">Serpent</char> (v.18). A common word.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(iii) <char style="it">Hurt</char> (v.18). Ranks 2808<char style="sup">th</char> out of 5394, where 1|
                                        |is most common and 5394 is least. This word is uncommon.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(iv) <char style="it">Poison</char> (v.18). Derived from a very common root.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(v) The phrase <char style="it">so then</char> (v. 19). Two extremely common words used as a phrase.|
                                        |Mark certainly knew the meaning of the phrase, but didn’t use it anywhere else.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(vi) <char style="it">Working alongside</char> (v.20). This is the verb form of the commonly-used noun|
                                        |<char style="it">fellow-worker.</char>|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(vii) <char style="it">Confirm</char> (v.20). Appears as 2803<char style="sup">rd</char> out of 5394.|
                                        |This word is uncommon and is not derived from a commonly used root.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |We can strike serpent, hurt, and poison from the list, since there are no alternatives for these words;|
                                        |Mark would’ve asked the scribe who was doing the actual writing to supply these words had he not known|
                                        |them and when he had need of them. This leaves four words, three of which are common, and Mark certainly|
                                        |knew, but he hadn’t used before. The list of uncommon words is whittled down to the single word <char|
                                        |style="it">confirm.</char>|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |As far as the style is concerned—and this is quite open-ended—true, Mark shifts his preference in verb|
                                        |tenses around, but this passage has little story-telling narrative. Another thing to note are the figures|
                                        |of speech used in vv.15,16. Would a forgerer risk using a figure or speech? Would a forgerer dwell on|
                                        |the disciples not believing when they should have (vv.13,14). While all these things with style are debatable,|
                                        |they are not definitive in determining whether the long ending of vv.9–20 is spurious or not.|

     V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |(the appointment being determined according to the priests’ tradition of rolling dice), having entered|
     v 9                                |into the temple sanctuary itself to light the incense; |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and everyone who was in the multitude, a multitude of the folk-people, was outside praying during the|

                                        |many have attempted to create a written record of the life of Jesus but did a mediocre job of it. He’s|
                                        |not referring to the Gnostic Gospels or some other heretical works, but to a few Christians who made|
                                        |early attempts to create what we now know as the Gospels but whose workmanship was a failure. Luke says|
                                        |here that he’ll correctly the problem and write his account accurately. Luke, the man of learning that|
                                        |he was, was versed in the correct method of writing history, the theory of which had been formulated|
                                        |by the first century. This passage gives us valuable insight into the formation of the four Gospels.|
                                        |None of the four were haphazardly written, all four gained the approval of the church leadership, and|
                                        |the “many” that Luke refers to in v.1 were rejected because they didn’t live up the standards set by|
                                        |the four that have been handed down through the ages. The four gospels were sponsored, by the church,|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |To achieve the self-set goals Luke stated in vv3,4, in addition to fulfilling the requirements for writing|
                                        |proper history, Luke had to have conducted direct, meticulous interviews with the eyewitnesses of what|
                                        |he wrote about. From the content in the first few chapters of his Gospel, he certainly would’ve had to|
                                        |interview Mary mother or Jesus, or perhaps (and this is a stretch) one of Jesus’s siblings, at a minimum,|
                                        |the shepherds who were there at his birth, etc. Conducting these interviews and documenting them would’ve|
                                        |taken a few months, would’ve had to have taken place in Israel, and would’ve had to have taken place|
                                        |in the lifetime of all the witnesses. The timeframe which fits these criteria is Paul’s second and third|
                                        |missionary journeys, in particular his third, which was around A.D. 55. This would’ve been the latest|
                                        |date for the composition of Luke’s Gospel, as beyond that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’s birth would’ve|

                                        |addresses Theophilus like he’s an aristocrat or that he had authority over him or both. This evidence|
                                        |has led scholars to conjecture that Luke was either a freedman, once a slave to Theophilus, or perhaps|
                                        |still a slave. But Theophilus had assigned him to be an assistant to Paul, donating Luke to Paul’s ministry|
                                        |like someone would donate a car to a charity. This might explain why Luke was the only person still with|
                                        |Paul at the time of his death (2 Tim. 4:11)—he had no choice but to stick with him. In any event, slaves|
                                        |in ancient Rome were often educated, and Luke certainly was. In addition, the name Theophilus means God-friend.|
                                        |We’ll assume that his name’s not a coincidence, that he wasn’t born with the name but changed it or acquired|
                                        |it when he became a Christian. In any event, both his name and the interest he has in the events surrounding|

                                        |was born a slave. Two great books were written by his student-followers: <char style="it">Discourses</char>|

                                        |of the tribe of Levi. The priests were not required to marry women from within that caste. Luke goes|
                                        |out of his way to mention the fact that Elizabeth was in the Aaronic lineage even before giving her name.|
                                        |This emphasizes the purity of John the Baptist’s parents’ pedigree, the level of sanctity, consecration,|
                                        |and cleanness, the Old Testament prerequisites for holiness. These John inherited as a result. The extreme|
                                        |degree to which the couple were sanctified to God would only magnify the intensity of the view that God|

                                        |act of drinking the older wine, claims that he prefers the older to the newer, without giving due consideration|
                                        |to the new. While drinking the old, his heightened awareness of its subtle, unique flavor causes him|
                                        |to lose any objectivity to the different qualities that the new will possess. His fondness for the wine|
                                        |at the moment produces a reaction which rejects any substitute—even to his detriment, as he may thoroughly|
                                        |enjoy the new wine also, were he to just give it a chance.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |And it reminds me of an old company in the landscape of corporate America which has an excellent product—be|
                                        |it an aircraft, a soft drink, what have you—and management in their hubris (or under pressure from the|
                                        |stockholders) thinks they can tinker with it and either to improve it or to shave a few pennies off its|
                                        |cost. But the old product is better. Or, don’t you miss the way they built such-and-such a few decades|
                                        |ago?—You have to pay top dollar on the used market to get one, because they’re not made anymore.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |These analogies are relevant to this passage. There were movements of God going on at the time, one of|
                                        |austerity (John the Baptist) and one of celebration (Jesus). Both are very different from one another.|
                                        |When one is caught up in the one, he becomes so enthralled with it that he will not see the value in|
                                        |the other. Jesus says that both are necessary and that there’s a time and place for both. Another application|
                                        |is that the old-timers had a more powerful presence of the Holy Spirit in their services than we do today.|

                                        |example: “Know them which labor among you,” 1 Thess. 5:12). In the NT, if someone who claimed to be a|
                                        |Christian conducted himself in an immoral manner, this person was to be treated like an infidel. But|
                                        |ascertaining such behavior is not judging. Judging is drawing conclusions, based on a person’s history,|
                                        |concluding what their fate or destiny must be. Condemning a person is determining that a person who has|
                                        |guilt due to sin will never be able to escape it, that part or all of their life is irredeemable—Even|
                                        |though it may in fact be irredeemable. To judge someone is to weigh them by their motives and not by|
                                        |their actions. To condemn someone is to assign them consequences. Concerning judging, ref. note of Matt.|

                                        |not any close contact. This is why the centurion said in v. 6 that it’s not appropriate for Jesus to|

                                        |choice. The UBS choice is consistent with and confirmed by the centurion’s statement in verse 8 which|

                                        |clear: the centurion is giving an order to a third party, the order being for the third party to relay|
                                        |another order to the person, the one who’s being summoned. What the centurion wants is for Jesus to relay|
                                        |a command through a third party (his friends), instead of Jesus giving a person-to-person order without|
                                        |the third party relay. This is the way that chain-of-command-structured authority hierarchies work; you|
                                        |can give a command to a subordinate who will in turn pass the command down the chain of subordinates.|
                                        |The centurion’s faith caused him to recognize that the kingdom of God must also be a chain-of-command-structured|

                                        |verses in the NT. It is commonly understood to be Satan being cast out of heaven prior to the creation|
                                        |of man (ref. Is. 14:12; Ez. 28:16; Rev. 12:7–9). This is not the case. Instead, Jesus is seeing in the|
                                        |spiritual world (ref. “discerning of spirits”, 1 Cor. 12:10) what the seventy-two who had been sent out|
                                        |were doing in the natural world. Jesus was watching in real time; each time they cast out a demon, he|
                                        |saw a lightning strike.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The elements to the correct interpretation of this passage, first, is that the word translated <char|
                                        |style="it">was watching </char>is in the Gk. imperfect tense. In this case, it insinuates multiple, repeated|
                                        |action, not a single action; plus it insinuates Jesus watching something unfold in real-time (in other|
                                        |words, watching concurrently as the disciples were doing it). Second, the Gk. word for <char style="it">heaven|
                                        |</char>(<char style="it">ouranos</char>/οὐρανός/Strong’s 3772) can mean either the sky (Acts 1:1), heaven|
                                        |itself (Luke 10:14), the spiritual world around us (1 Cor. 12:2; Eph. 6:12), or a place of spiritual|
                                        |dominion. In the case of Luke 10:18, <char style="it">ouranos </char>means the third: a place of spiritual|
                                        |dominion. Third, the word <char style="it">Satan </char>is used as a synecdoche/metonymy for the word|
                                        |<char style="it">demon</char> (also in Matt. 12:26; Luke 13:16). Fourth, the word <char style="it">fall|
                                        |</char>refers to somebody or something losing its authority or dominion, usually by force (Rev. 18:2;|
                                        |Rev. 12:7–9).|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The correct interpretation of Jesus seeing multiple demons get cast down in real-time is relevant to|
                                        |the enclosing context. In other words, Jesus sent the disciples out, and in v. 17 they come back rejoicing,|
                                        |telling what had happened. Jesus regurgitating something which happened thousands of years before would|
                                        |be irrelevant and incongruous to the remark his disciples just made.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">legitimately claim and lay hold of</char>…Lit: <char style="it">inherit</char>. To <char|
                                        |style="it">inherit</char> or <char style="it">the inheritance</char> or simply <char style="it">possess|
                                        |</char>refer to the same biblical concept. The concept of the inheritance is that God has a specific|
                                        |place He has reserved for you, that you have claim to, and He promises to bring you to it (inheriting)|
                                        |and to keep you in it (salvation), and to restore you to it should you lose it (redemption). The concept|
                                        |of the inheritance starts in the OT with God promising Abraham a land, not only to him but to his descendants,|
                                        |and this land is eventually subdivided into continuously smaller pieces, down to individual, single-family|
                                        |lots. Such subdividing of the land is enumerated in Joshua chapters 13–22. Though the concept of the|
                                        |inheritance begins with God communicating to His man, His tribe, His people that He has promised them|
                                        |a portion of land, it then extends into the journey to get to that land and to the obedience required|
                                        |to take possession of that land. Some examples: Ps. 37:9,29; Prov. 10:30; Is. 14:21; Is. 57:13; 60:21).|
                                        |The concept is applicable beyond land to anything God promises a believer to have, which in the case|
                                        |of v. 25 refers to eternal life.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">eternal life</char>…This phrase is used throughout the NT, particularly in the Gospel|
                                        |of John. From the face-value meaning of the words, <char style="it">eternal life </char>would appear|
                                        |to mean life after death, but there are a couple of problems with that interpretation. First, the OT,|
                                        |and by extension Judaism, emphasizes the here-and-now and de-emphasizes life after death, to the point|
                                        |where some Jews (the Sadducees) didn’t even believe in life after death. Second, Jesus said in v. 28,|
                                        |“Do this and you shall live.” He’s talking about the here-and-now, not the life to come. This leaves|
                                        |the unanswered question: what exactly does the NT mean by the phrase <char style="it">eternal life</char>?|
                                        |The answer comes from reading all the passages that talk about eternal life, reading them with an understanding|
                                        |that it’s talking about the here-and-now, not life after death, and meditating on the evidence. The answer|
                                        |will then present itself.|

                                        |is one of many. Put together, it’s assumed that this paints a picture of Mary choosing between good and|

                                        |context the omission of the definite article indicates the nature of the gift which the Father is giving,|
                                        |that the nature of the gift is good and never bad, and that if He’s giving the gift of a spirit, you|

     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |1. The appearance of the definite article (<char style="it">to</char>) precludes this phrase from being|
                                        |in the vocative case; it must therefore be accusative|

     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |3. The use of the adjective <char style="it">micron </char>is somewhat redundant considering that <char|
                                        |style="it">poimnon </char>is already a diminutive, and by implication describes something small.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |4. Preceded by the definite article, the adjective is attributive and not predicative, which makes it|
                                        |more likely to be an expression.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |3. The use of the definite article means that Luke is referring to something specific.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">Sell…make…make</char>…The verb tense used here (the aorist) for these imperative verbs|
                                        |insinuate a few things. First, this tense is more emphatic than the default tense (the present). Second,|
                                        |it implies a one-time action. The one-time action of selling and giving doesn’t mean that there won’t|

                                        |every time one accumulates belongings. Jesus is being emphatic to get them to break a mindset of hoarding|

                                        |12:50), along with 1 Cor. 10:2 and with the accounts of John the Baptist, shed light on what the word|
                                        |<char style="it">baptism </char>means in the Bible, and consequently what it is for a Christian to be|
                                        |baptized. In Luke 12:50, the baptism Jesus is referring to is his death and resurrection. In 1 Cor. 10:2,|
                                        |the nation of Israel was baptized into Moses by the cloud and the sea. And John the Baptist’s baptism|
                                        |was one of repentance. These passages on baptism reveal the following: Baptism is a totally transformative|
                                        |event. A person’s post-baptism life is changed entirely with respect to his pre-baptism life. The person|
                                        |being baptized enters into a binding contract, a covenant, of some sort. In order to undergo the transformation|
                                        |associated with baptism, the person being baptized must surrender his life to the transformation. After|
                                        |the baptism, the covenant which the person entered into is subject to terms, terms not only for the one|
                                        |baptized but also for God. God commits Himself to terms which consists of promises, and though a person|
                                        |is bound by the terms of the covenant, on the other hand he benefits from the terms God commits to, acquiring|
                                        |the promises. This baptism-covenant pattern summarizes Christianity: a total commitment by the one being|
                                        |baptized to the terms of the covenant (God’s commandments); access through faith to the promises of God|

                                        |a dispute…</char>In this parable, Jesus tells his followers that each person should objectively consider|
                                        |both sides of a dispute he’s embroiled in, and determine if his opponent’s case is stronger than his|
                                        |own. Jesus is teaching them to impartially weigh the merits of both sides of the case. He repeats this|
                                        |point in a different parable in Luke 14:31. But in addition to objectively considering both sides to|
                                        |an argument, what Jesus says in vv. 57–59 is that once you weigh both sides of a dispute, you’ll find|
                                        |that your case is in fact the weaker of the two, and that being the situation, it would behoove you to|
                                        |settle the dispute between just the two of you and not let it go before a judge and have him settle it|
                                        |instead. This parable has several applications, the first application is that one is better “settling|
                                        |out of court” and receiving the remission of sins offered by Christ and not attempting to prove one’s|
                                        |own righteousness based on works in a courtroom before God, where the verdict will be against you. Another|
                                        |application is walking in the Spirit rather than walking in your plain self. If you weight the evidence,|
                                        |you’ll find that plain-self, as it turns out, is dominated by the carnal nature, and as such cannot fulfill|
                                        |the lofty requirements of the Christian life. Christians should recognize that living their life apart|
                                        |from the indwelling Spirit is a losing proposition and should seek to redress the problem as soon as|
                                        |possible.|

                                        |(loses its saltiness). Salt is a simple compound that doesn’t spoil like a biomass. Second, in v. 35,|
                                        |the suggestion is to not put the salt in the ground or the compost pile (lit: <char style="it">manure|
                                        |pile</char>). Even if salt did lose its potency, it’s still salt, and as salt it will poison any ground|
                                        |or compost it’s applied to. One will never put actual salt in the ground or in a compost pile. There|

                                        |of the underworld. It is simply the place where the dead go. As can be seen in this story, it consists|

                                        |As it appears, when Lazarus became too old or too frail to perform his duties, the rich man tossed him|
                                        |out on the street, where he had to beg for the remainder of his life. The rich man’s wealth and lavish|
                                        |lifestyle wasn’t directly responsible for his punishment in the afterlife, but the wealth and deceitful|
                                        |lifestyle fueled a disdain for his fellow man, and that ultimately is what landed him in hell. There|

                                        |be taken to mean “enough of this nonsense” or “that’ll be enough swords.” The former is assumed to be|
                                        |correct, as it is connected to what Jesus said in v. 36: “have him sell his jacket [lit: cloak] and have|
                                        |him buy a sword.” What Jesus meant by this statement of v. 36 is that you’ll no longer need your cloak.|
                                        |Everyone owned a cloak, and most people owned just one, and it was used as a blanket at night—which would|
                                        |be your only blanket too. In the long-term, a cloak was an essential need of life, but in the short-term|
                                        |is not a necessity, like when one is engaged in moderate physical activity, since the body generates|
                                        |enough heat to keep oneself warm without needing a cloak for warmth. The cloak becomes necessary after|
                                        |the activity, of course. The sword refers to going to a war. Together, what v. 36 means is for you to|
                                        |get rid of your cloak since you won’t be needing it anymore, but acquire a sword in its place, since|
                                        |you will be needing that: You’re going to war and you’ll probably be killed. Jesus didn’t literally mean|
                                        |to buy a sword and go off to battle; his meaning was figurative. But the twelve didn’t see it as figurative,|
                                        |taking the statement literally. Jesus didn’t have enough time to explain himself, so he simply dropped|
                                        |the subject by saying “just forget it, ok.”|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Verses 43 and 44 are not found in some of the most important manuscripts (KJV: “43And there appeared|
                                        |an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and|
                                        |his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”)This passage has always been|
                                        |controversial, and that because of its content. Verse 43 has the same spurious feel to it as John 5:4,|
                                        |and verse 44 has been debated for centuries (see next note).|

                                        |drops of sweat dripped onto the ground is compared to the rate at which, say for example, you cut your|
                                        |finger with a knife—the rate at which that cut bleeds. That’s a high rate of perspiration, one which|
                                        |occurs when a person is engaged in highly strenuous exercise, usually complicated by warmer temperatures.|
                                        |The fact that Jesus wasn’t physically moving and that it was chilly enough later in the night for Peter|
                                        |to have to warm himself around a fire makes this extraordinary. On the other hand, there’s dubious (at|
                                        |best) scientific evidence to back up the claim that people under extreme duress sweat blood. It simply|
                                        |does not happen. So if Jesus did actually sweat drops of blood, as many assert, that removes that experience|
                                        |of prayer out of the realm of human experience and into the super-human, even supernatural, and in this|
                                        |instance would have exempted him from suffering as an ordinary human being.|

                                        |clauses, the present tense seems to emphasize a difficulty of some sort—perhaps even a long, drawn-out|

                                        |miracle Jesus ever performed (ref. v. 12), and it’s significant that it occurred at a wedding. This wedding|
                                        |has a symbolic meaning, and what Jesus says here addresses the symbolism of the event. The wedding symbolizes|
                                        |God’s plan for the human race. God intended all of mankind to live life as though it were one long wedding|
                                        |celebration of a sort, but then sin entered into the world and spoiled the party. Wine is what generates|
                                        |the frivolity and lightens the mood, causing the guests to loosen up and celebrate. Wine symbolizes the|
                                        |means by which mankind can enter into life’s celebration. But also, as red wine has a color similar to|
                                        |blood, at the same time it’s symbolic of the blood Jesus shed on our behalf. The symbolism is this: the|
                                        |party is over until someone supplies the wine (the blood), which brings life back to a dead party. When|
                                        |Mary tells Jesus they have no wine, on the symbolic level, she’s telling him to give the blood which|
                                        |will restore the human race to its festivities. This is why Jesus replied, <char style="it">my time has|
                                        |not yet arrived</char>—the time for him to shed his blood had not yet arrived.|

                                        |<char style="it">that day</char>; etc. All these phrases in general refer to the time of a fulfillment|

                                        |in adultery. For reference, this is translated in the note following. This story indeed is a beautiful|
                                        |illustration of the gospel, and this is the reason why it was spliced into the Gospel of John after John|
                                        |wrote it, as it is a spurious addition: the external evidence (i.e. the manuscript evidence) is overwhelming.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |As far as the internal aspects of this passage (and this is quite subjective), the GT of this passage|
                                        |appears to be more polished than what John writes (John’s text is herky-jerky); this passage is more|
                                        |fluid and therefore easier to translate that what’s found in John’s gospel. Furthermore, John tends to|
                                        |shy away from using specific, descriptive words such as v. 4/<char style="it">in the very act </char>(<char|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The fact that Jesus was writing on the ground with his finger is a bit weird. It also begs the question,|
                                        |if Jesus was teaching in the temple, and all the temple flooring is made of stone, then how could he|
                                        |write something with just his finger, seeing that there’s no soil wherewith to form recognizable letters|
                                        |in?|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |7:53And each one went home, 8:1and Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2He appeared in the temple early|
                                        |in the morning, and all the folk-people began to come to him, and he sat teaching them. 3The Scribes|
                                        |and the Pharisees brought him a woman caught by surprise in adultery, and stood her right in front of|
                                        |everyone. 4They said to him, “Teacher, this here woman was caught in the very act of adultery. 5Now in|
                                        |the Law of Moses it’s commanded that such a person be stoned to death. So what do you have to say?” 6They|
                                        |were saying this to test him, so that they would have something to accuse him of. Jesus was crouched|
                                        |down and kept on writing on the ground. 7As they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and|
                                        |asked them, “Let he who’s without sin throw the first stone.” 8He crouched down again and continued writing|
                                        |on the ground. 9One by one, the listeners began to leave, from the oldest, and he was left alone, the|
                                        |woman being right in front. 10Jesus straightened up and told her, “Woman, where are they? No one’s condemning|
                                        |you.” 11She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Nor do I condemn you. Go and, from now on, don’t sin anymore.”|

                                        |of law, so as to draw conclusions about people so as to write them off. Ref. Matt. 7:1.|

                                        |and violent criminal than the ordinary thief. In this hendiadys, Jesus explains that this thief is not|
                                        |your ordinary thief, but one who commits unwarranted and wanton acts of violence in addition to his thievery.|
                                        |When Jesus speaks of the thief in v. 10, the thief he refers to is the same one he describes in vv. 1,8.|
                                        |So the thief of v. 10 is a violent destructive thief, not just simply a larcenist.|

                                        |was reclining, one of his disciples, in Jesus’s bosom, whom Jesus was loving</char>. Liberties taken|
                                        |here; also in vv. 12, 25. The disciples were reclined, not sitting (ref. note of Luke 16:22). It’s likely|
                                        |that John was propped up on his arm (hand on side of head, elbow on the couch); in v. 25 the Gk. text|
                                        |literally says that he <char style="it">fell back </char>[<char style="it">leaned back</char>] <char|

                                        |and leaned back. This change in position caused his head to be in contact with Jesus’s bosom, specifically|
                                        |his stomach and chest. He leaned back so that his head would be in close proximity to Jesus’s head, so|
                                        |that he could speak a few words with him that no one else could hear.|

                                        |of bread directly into Judas’s mouth, similar to how a bride and a groom put wedding cake into each other’s|
                                        |mouth—a similar type of symbolism. It may be that John is implying that, just as the bread was physically|
                                        |placed into Judas’s mouth and entered his body, on a parallel level Satan entered Judas’s heart.|

                                        |is a figure of speech: instead of stating the commandment, the end-result of the commandment is stated|

                                        |GT is a figure of speech. But what is actually meant is arduousness. In order for Jesus to prepare a|
                                        |place, he must first endure the cross, and only then afterwards, being resurrected and ascending to the|
                                        |Father, can he prepare a place. He having to go to the cross is not tentative but arduous; hence the|
                                        |figure of speech. |

                                        |Obvious to the reader of the GT, v. 14 is a repetition of v. 13a. The difference between the wording|
                                        |in these two verses is that v. 13 is a more compact repetition, omitting a few words with the confidence|
                                        |that the reader will understand that they were omitted for brevity. Therefore, the repetition of the|
                                        |statement is a figure of speech, one where Jesus wants to be clear about what he’s saying and to emphasize|

                                        |</char>is used throughout Acts, John’s Gospel and his epistles, and elsewhere in the NT. This usage in|

                                        |NT. First, begin with an understanding of the usage of <char style="it">witness </char>in the OT, which|
                                        |is a person testifying in a court of law. After that, study the context of v. 40 here, and the definition|
                                        |of <char style="it">witnessing </char>becomes apparent. Apply this understanding to other places in the|
                                        |NT where <char style="it">witness </char>is used (Acts 1:8 for example).|

                                        |to each according to his need.” Keep in mind the following, however. First, Luke states this as a fact|
                                        |and does not say that it was a command, confirmed by what Peter said in Acts 5:4. Second, the apostles|
                                        |were convinced that Jesus would return to earth any day now—certainly no more than a few weeks hence—so|
                                        |what’s the use of owning property? Third, Acts 8:1 said that there was a great persecution against the|
                                        |church in Jerusalem. In such a persecution, those persecuted would surely have had their property confiscated,|
                                        |so they might’ve anticipated this and sold what they owned preemptively. Fourth, not everyone sold what|
                                        |they owned; otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to meet from house to house (v. 46), as there wouldn’t|
                                        |have been any houses to meet at. Fifth, this was an extraordinary period of revival, and extraordinary|

                                        |Holy Spirit</char>. In the Bible the word <char style="it">spirit </char>has multiple meanings; sometimes|
                                        |it means <char style="it">Holy Spirit</char>, sometimes it means a person’s spirit, sometimes it refers|
                                        |to a deeply-rooted disposition of one sort or another (example of that is 2 Tim. 1:7). The NT writers|

                                        |they added qualifiers to the word <char style="it">spirit </char>where ambiguity might exist. (Or they|
                                        |added qualifiers for emphasis.) The qualifiers consist of adding an article, adding the word <char style="it">Holy</char>,|
                                        |or<char style="it"> </char>forming a full predicative construct. So in v. 5, such a qualifier is added,|
                                        |as Stephen is <char style="it">full of the Holy Spirit</char>, not <char style="it">full of spirit</char>.|
                                        |But the usage in v. 3 has no qualifiers, is paired with another personal quality <char style="it">wisdom</char>,|
                                        |so therefore does not refer to the Holy Spirit.|

                                        |church deacons—had to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do their job. They were put in charge|
                                        |of the food distribution in order to ensure that it was being done fairly, that widows were not being|
                                        |overlooked because of their ethnicity. This required spirit and wisdom. But it is not a necessary prerequisite|
                                        |for the ordinary church worker to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do the simple, mundane|
                                        |labor that all churches require (such as being an usher, a greeter, etc.). Faithfulness and a willingness|
                                        |to work with others is about all such a worker needs. Furthermore, the takeaway from this passage is|
                                        |that a deacon is an overseer, one who can oversee an area of responsibility which is fraught with moral|
                                        |challenges; the run-of-the-mill church worker is not a deacon. If the qualification for every church|
                                        |worker was that he had to be filled with spirit and wisdom (in addition to being faithful and getting|
                                        |along with others), then there would be very few church workers, and much work would remain undone. Also,|

                                        |in Mark 3:1; Luke 4:16; Luke 6:6, 13:14; 14:1; 17:1,2,10; 18:19; 19:30; 28:8; James 2:2. It has a few|
                                        |different meanings (or multiple meanings at the same time). What should be kept in mind is that a synagogue|
                                        |is first and foremost an assembly of people, in the same way that a church is an assembly of people,|
                                        |and secondly a building or some other premise. Therefore, this expression means: He introduced himself|

                                        |became affiliated with the synagogue; He visited the synagogue. It may be that this expression denotes|
                                        |a formal custom of introduction where a new member is greeted by those in the synagogue. As part of this,|
                                        |the new member’s credentials are submitted, and if he’s learned enough in the Scriptures, he’ll be given|

                                        |groups. This idiom is also used in phrases like “enter into the kingdom of heaven,” “enter into eternal|

     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and so Paul goes on to say, “I didn’t know, comrades, that he’s a high priest. You see, it’s written|

     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |(On the one side of the dispute, Sadducees assert that there is no life after death, nor are there angels|
     v 8                                |or spirits; whereas Pharisees profess the opposite.) |

 +   V28              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |And just as they did not approve of retaining the accumulated knowledge and understanding of God, God|

     v29                                |are full of envy, murder, strife, Machiavellian-styled rivalry, malevolence; they’re gossips and slanderers,|

     v18                                |one act of righteousness resulted in making available to every person the ability of to have the slate|

 +   V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Or are you unaware, comrades (and I’m speaking to those of you who’re familiar with the operative details|
     v 1                                |of a law-code), that the Law of Moses exercises control over a person only during that person’s lifetime?|
     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To this point, a married woman (who owing to marriage laws is under the authority of her husband, who|
     v 2                                |has the legal right to initiate a divorce—but not she) is legally bound to her husband while he’s alive.|
     v 2                                |If the husband were to die, then-and-only-then will she be released from her legal constraint to her|
     v 2                                |husband. |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So then, while her husband’s still alive, she’d be officially labeled an adulteress if she were to get|
     v 3                                |married (and therefore under the authority of and bound to) to another man.|
 +   V 4              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In the same way, my fellow comrades, through the body of Christ you too have been put to death in relation|
     v 4                                |to the Law of Moses resulting in you having come into being under the authority of and bound to another—to|
     v 4                                |him who’s been raised from the dead—in order that you would produce aftereffects in God. |
     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, when you were in the flesh (i.e., trying in and of yourself to live up to God’s rules while|
     v 5                                |at the same time beholden to your carnal nature), the passions of the sins pervasive to mankind, those|
     v 5                                |things that, on account of the Law, were repeatedly at work in our body parts (i.e., your personal carnal|
     v 5                                |signature) resulting in the production of aftereffects in death (i.e., in a stagnation of waste, joylessness,|
     v 5                                |futility, and destruction).|
 +   V 6              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But as things stand now, we’ve been released from the Law of Moses, having died to that which kept holding|
     v 6                                |us down, so that we serve in newness of spirit (i.e. walking in line with and dominated by a regenerated|
     v 6                                |human spirit, which is in communion with the Holy Spirit) and not oldness of letter (i.e., a strict,|
     v 6                                |literal, exacting interpretation of the verbatim Law of Moses, along with a grueling, rigid adherence|
     v 6                                |done the “old way”—out of a person’s self-ability).|
 +   V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So what’s there to say about this? Are we to conclude that the Law of Moses is characteristic of and|
     v 7                                |has the quality and nature of sin?—Don’t even think about it—on the contrary I would not have come to|
     v 7                                |know, recognize, and understand the sin pervasive to mankind if not through law (i.e., by conducting|
     v 7                                |my life under the weight of a long list of God-ordained rules); for indeed I would’ve come to know this|
     v 7                                |first-hand had not the Law of Moses kept on telling me over and over, “Thou shalt not covet such-and-such.”|
     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Sin took advantage of the situation through the commandment “thou shalt not covet” and worked utterly|
     v 8                                |in me every sort of coveting imaginable: you see, apart from law (i.e., being forced to obey a list of|
     v 8                                |rules) sin is dead. |
     V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In the past I was alive and living apart from law; but the commandment came and the sin of coveting which|
     v 9                                |I just mentioned sprang to life; |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I died. It became evident in me that the commandment—the same one leading to life—was leading to death.|
     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To be more specific, the sin of coveting through the commandment took advantage of the situation, fooled|
     v11                                |me completely, and killed me (i.e., caused me to die spiritually) by this. |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Consequently, the Law of Moses is indeed holy, and the commandment “thou shalt not covet” is holy and|
     v12                                |just and good.|
 +   V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?—Don’t even think about it; on the|
     v13                                |contrary, in order that the nature and devastation of sin would become apparent, sin utterly worked death|
     v13                                |through the good in me, so that the sin of coveting would reach its maximal efficacy through the commandment|
     v13                                |“thou shalt not covet.” |
     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, we know for a fact that the Law is intrinsically spiritual; I am fleshly (i.e., the nature of|
     v14                                |my physical body is that it is susceptible to carnal temptations, and that part of me does not want to|
     v14                                |serve God), having been sold by the sin pervasive to mankind: |
     V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I don’t understand nor do I recognize what it is that I’m getting done; the fact of the matter is, I’m|
     v15                                |not putting into practice what I want—I’m doing what I hate instead. |
     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But if I’m doing what I don’t want to, I concur with the Law of Moses, concurring that it’s good. |
     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |At this point, though, it’s no longer me personally accomplishing this but rather the sin which inhabits|
     v17                                |me.|
 +   V18              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, I know for a fact that good does not inhabit me, that is, in my flesh (i.e. in my human, carnal|
     v18                                |nature); for the wanting is present in me, at hand ready to jump in, but getting the good done is not|
     v18                                |happening. |
     V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, I’m not doing the good that I want to do, but instead, I’m doing the bad which I don’t want|
     v19                                |to do and doing it on a day-to-day basis. |
     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Now if what I don’t want to do is the thing that I’m doing, It’s no longer me producing the finished|
     v20                                |product but the sin which inhabits me is producing it instead. |
     V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I’m discovering the Law of God (i.e., the principle that one should do right and live according to God’s|
     v21                                |will), then, with the wanting in me to do the good, because the bad is present in me, ready to rear its|
     v21                                |ugly head; |
     V22              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |you see, I delight in the Law of God with respect to the inner-person, |
     V23              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |but I see another law (i.e., a different principle) in my body parts (i.e., in my unique carnal signature)|
     v23                                |waging war against the law of my mind (i.e. against the principles by which my mind operate), defeating|
     v23                                |me and making me a prisoner of the sin which exists in my body parts. |
     V24              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |What a miserable person I am: who’ll rescue me from this body which is rooted in death?— |
     V25              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |God is so good through Jesus Christ our Lord!—So then me—on the one hand I’m enslaved in mind to a law|
     v25                                |of God (i.e., to a principle set in place by God), but on the other hand I’m enslaved in flesh to a law|
     v25                                |of sin (i.e., to a principle of sin caused by carnality).|

     v 2                                |Spirit) set you free from the law of the sin which afflicts mankind and the ensuing death (i.e. the principle|

     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, the inability of the Law of Moses in that it was continually weak through the flesh (i.e., through|
     v 3                                |human ability alone apart from God and aggravated by human carnality), God sent His very-own son in sinful-flesh|

     v 5                                |flesh; those whose existence is in accordance with spirit (i.e. with living a spiritual life) think about|

     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Therefore, the mindset of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it doesn’t submit to the Law of God; in fact,|

     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The fact is, any people—any people at all—who’re led by the Spirit of God: these people are sons of God.|

     v18                                |glory that’s going to be revealed to us. |

     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly of course—no—it was subjected on account|
     v20                                |of whoever or whatever subjected it, resting upon hope |
     V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |that the creation itself will be set free from the slavery of corruption (a corruption like decomposing|
     v21                                |organic matter) over to the freedom of the sons of God. |
     V22              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Regarding this, we know from first-hand experience that every bit of the creation moans and groans in|

     V24              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, we were saved by hope; hope which is seen (i.e., is of something which verifiably exists in|
     v24                                |the physical world) isn’t hope—just who hopes for what he sees? |

     v26                                |something) with our weakness: you see, we don’t know how we must pray or what we must pray; instead of|
     v26                                |us being constrained by that limitation, when he intercedes on behalf of others, the Spirit himself intercedes|

                                        |choice was not arbitrary, but was based on the heart of Jacob and of Esau. Furthermore, Jacob’s and Esau’s|
                                        |hearts were fixated while they were still in Rebekah’s womb—which is unusual. While, certainly, God chose|

                                        |hearts before they were born and decided based on what was in them. When says in v. 15 that God will|
                                        |have mercy on whomever He chooses, it implies that no one is in a position to come to God and demand|

                                        |as the comprehensive body of thought on a subject matter the ancient Greeks captured in a book (a scroll).|
                                        |Thus, the great philosophers wrote treatises on everything from science to politics. These treatises|
                                        |were the logos for a subject, the written word on that subject. On the other hand, a rhema is a spoken|
                                        |word on a subject, as indicated by its usage in Heb. 12:20. Since it’s spoken and not written, one infers|
                                        |a few things about it. First, it isn’t a comprehensive erudition on a subject. For this reason, John|
                                        |called Jesus the Logos and not the Rhema. Second, since it’s spoken, it’s applied to a particular situation|
                                        |at a particular point in time; it’s the logos applied in real-time; it’s a specific application of the|
                                        |logos. Third, the rhema spoken about in v. 8 the “word of faith” is the word which is “in your mouth|
                                        |and in your heart” and is spoken out “of faith.” Rhema is the logos, the written word, planted in one’s|
                                        |heart and spoken out of one’s mouth. The promise given in v. 9 is that anyone who speaks such a rhema|
                                        |about Jesus being Lord and God raising him from the dead is guaranteed to receive the promise, in this|

     V23              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |we, on the other hand, preach a crucified-Christ; for Jews it’s the root-cause of the failure caused|
     v23                                |by disobedience on the one end of the stick, on the other end of the stick, for Westerners it’s stupidity,|

     v24                                |the summons), Jews and Westerners alike, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom, |
     V25              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |since the “stupidity” of God is wiser than the wisdom to be found in mankind, and the “weakness” of God|

     v27                                |of the world to put to shame the strong, |
     V28              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and God’s chosen the lowly born and those things which are contemptuous—He’s chosen the things that don’t|

     V29              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |so that any and every human endeavor or accomplishment apart from God can’t be presented proudly before|

     v30                                |righteousness, and likewise holiness and redemption (i.e., the recovery of what you once had), |

                                        |the GT. One surmises from the context that Paul assumed that the reader would supply these words. Not|
                                        |adding this phrase makes Paul’s statement oxymoronic at face value. Evangelization, when successful,|
                                        |results in people receiving Christ, and those who receive Christ should be baptized. Therefore, successful|
                                        |evangelization results in baptism; you cannot have the one without the other. Since Paul was sent as|
                                        |an apostle to evangelize the Gospel, he must’ve been sent to baptize (either himself personally or someone|

                                        |to manifest his power. As we know from the NT, Paul was not naturally like this; on the contrary, he|
                                        |was the opposite. But the Corinthians put such a high premium on speakers with great oratory skills,|

     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">To me, everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial</char>…Though Paul|
                                        |said that everything is permissible, it’s impossible to accept this statement at face-value, as he lists|
                                        |a few things in this chapter which are not permissible for anyone to do, stealing and being covetous|
                                        |for example. How is this logical dilemma to be solved? Paul is stating his perspective—his philosophy—on|
                                        |whether he will engage in an activity or not. Rather than looking at some deed as permissible or forbidden,|
                                        |he changes the perspective to look at whether said deed is beneficial or non-beneficial. The understanding|
                                        |is that whether it’s permissible or not will logically align with whether it’s beneficial or not. The|
                                        |examples of greed and covetousness Paul categorizes as non-beneficial, so it’s irrelevant whether they’re|
                                        |permissible or not, since Paul’s not going to do them anyways because they’re non-beneficial. By this|
                                        |reasoning, whether something is permissible or not is moot. Adopting this perspective goes a long way|
                                        |to resolving the issue of legalism which inevitably arises in the pursuit of religion.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">all sins that a person happens to commit are done outside the body, but the fornicator|

                                        |from all other sins, being a sin done to your body, is given in the previous verses: a fornicator unites|
                                        |his body with the person he commits the act with, and the two become a single body. When a couple is|
                                        |united sexually, their bodies merge into one body. Merging your body with someone who’s trash causes|
                                        |your body to be corrupted by the trash from the other body.|

                                        |saying that our bodies form a temple and within this temple the Holy Spirit dwells. The analogy is the|

                                        |a good conscience, an evil conscience, a weak conscience, and a seared conscience. A person’s conscience|

                                        |potential for ambiguity. Paul was cognizant of this as he was committing his words to paper (parchment,|

                                        |said that, cultural traditions stretch back for millennia, traditions where women wear head covering.|
                                        |It appears that Paul is talking about a tradition which was peculiar to the Corinthians, where it was|
                                        |shameful for a man to have something over his head in a public forum of some sort, while it was shameful|
                                        |for a woman to not have something over her head in the same forum. There’s a parallel between one’s head|
                                        |which is a body part and one’s head which is the next level up in the submission chain (Paul speaks of|
                                        |the “head” in Eph. 5:23 the same way). So the woman not having a covering over her head would be seen|
                                        |as a sign of disrespect to her head, to man.|

                                        |style="it">through the angels </char>can be rendered in a couple of variations such as <char style="it">by|

                                        |is whether <char style="it">her head</char> (lit., <char style="it">the head</char>)<char style="it">|
                                        |</char>in this verse refers to the woman’s physical head or to her higher-up (man). Assuming that the|
                                        |latter is the case and that <char style="it">head </char>here doesn’t refer to her physical head, then|
                                        |this would mean that the woman exercises power, authority, and control over the man, but it is done by|
                                        |means of the angels. This agrees with Paul’s previous observation that woman came out of man, but man|
                                        |is birthed by woman; both woman comes from man, and man comes from woman; neither is superior; both are|
                                        |dependent on the other. This is simply a restatement of v. 12. In keeping with this, the woman has authority|
                                        |(has control over) the man, a control which is accomplished on a spiritual level by the employment of|

                                        |attitude—pneumatikos acquires these flavors of meaning: related to or of the Holy Spirit; related to|

                                        |Though Paul didn’t invent this word, he coined the usage of it in the NT. The meaning of pneumatikos|
                                        |in Paul’s writings is best understood from the way Paul uses it and from firsthand Christian experience—not|
                                        |from what’s written in the lexicons. When pneumatikos appears in the NT, the context will guide you as|
                                        |to which of these various definitions to use. In v. 1 here, the context suggests things related to or|
                                        |pertaining to the Holy Spirit, where <char style="it">Holy Spirit </char>is a synecdoche which refers|

                                        |Spirit (an example being Acts 8:15). So pneumatikos as used here refers to things that the Holy Spirit|
                                        |does and not the Holy Spirit himself per se. This is not the case in other NT usages of pneumatikos,|

                                        |prophecy, tongues, and knowledge. Not one, not two, but all three will cease. Some have taught in the|

                                        |have been the completion of the NT canon.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But there is coming a time—probably after death—when all three will cease, including knowledge. One might|
                                        |see why tongues and prophecy will cease, but what about knowledge? Does this mean that when we get to|
                                        |heaven, we’ll forget everything we knew on the earth? I should think not. The answer lies a bit deeper,|
                                        |specifically in an understanding of the Gk. word used for <char style="it">know</char>. NT Gk. has two|
                                        |principle verbs for “to know,” and from the verbs all the other forms, in this case the nouns, are derived.|
                                        |The first word is <char style="it">oida</char>, and it&apos;s actually an awkward form of another verb|
                                        |which means “to see.” The other word is <char style="it">gnōskō</char>. Oida and <char style="it">ginōskō</char>,|
                                        |although both translated &quot;to know&quot;, have distinct meanings. Oida means to know because a fact|
                                        |or thing is obvious, it’s something one knows because one has seen it, hence the connection to the verb|
                                        |“to see.” Ginōskō, on the other hand, refers to knowledge that one has obtained without the use of the|
                                        |senses. Ginōskō involves a level of abstraction, or reasoning, to arrive at the thing known, since it’s|
                                        |not directly discernable. For example, I “oida” that the shirt I’m wearing is red, but I “<char style="it">ginōskō|
                                        |</char>“ that the spare-penny dish at the checkout line at the convenience store is usually empty, because|
                                        |people are more apt to reach for a penny when they’re two or three cents short of the next dollar than|
                                        |they are to remember to put their spare pennies in the dish. Ginōskō is also a root used to derive other|
                                        |words, but in every case the meaning still involves some thought process. Hence, ginōskō or its derivatives|
                                        |are, among others, translated “understand,” “discern,” or “recognize.” In the NT, ginōskō is sometimes|
                                        |used in reference to spiritual knowledge, because spiritual things cannot be seen, and faith, by nature,|
                                        |believes in what one cannot see, and therefore is always abstract.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But there’s coming a day when the faith necessary to believe in God won’t be necessary, because we won’t|
                                        |be living on this earth anymore. All ginōskō knowledge will be replaced with oida knowledge, which will|
                                        |not cease—only ginōskō knowledge will. Questions and mysteries will be done away with too, at that time.|
                                        |But while we’re still here on earth, there are certain things we must know without having seen, or having|
                                        |conclusive proofs demonstrated to us. There’s things that also happen to us, or to others we know, that|
                                        |are a mystery. Why did this tragedy occur? Many ask, was it God’s will? Where was God in all of this?|
                                        |A lot of things we don’t—nor ever will—know the answer to, not here on this earth. This doesn’t mean|
                                        |that there’s not a good explanation for it; what it does mean is that the explanation is beyond our reach.|
                                        |Often when people don’t have the answer, they must fill that unknowing in them and produce their own|
                                        |explanation, and often this results in speculations about God’s will. This has become the source of a|
                                        |lot of poor doctrine. Just accept the fact that there are certain things that we’ll never understand|
                                        |in this lifetime until the perfect comes, but that there’s probably a good explanation for these things.|

                                        |A puzzling verse. J.B. Phillips, author of <char style="it">The New Testament in Modern English </char>(1958|
                                        |version), wrote, “This is the sole instance of the translator’s departing from the accepted text. He|
                                        |felt bound to conclude, from the sense of the next three verses, that we have here either a slip of the|
                                        |pen on the part of Paul, or, more probably, a copyist’s error.” In other words, Phillips is justifying|
                                        |the fact that he swapped a couple words to make sense of this verse. I disagree with Phillips; however,|
                                        |this verse must be supplied with interpolations to make sense of it. Verse 22 begins with the Gk. word|

                                        |Hōste connects two thoughts, and an interpolation has been added to beginning of the verse to make this|
                                        |more apparent (Matt. 12:12 is an example). Verse 22 is tightly coupled with v. 21, being linked to the|
                                        |quotation from Is. 28:11–12. What this means is that tongues is a sign that the prophecy from Isaiah|
                                        |has been fulfilled, so that those who don’t believe should recognize it as the fulfillment of this prophecy.|

                                        |based on the context and is affirmed by v. 2, which says that a person who speaks in tongues speaks to|
                                        |God. Many have taken the first half of v. 28, “Now if there’s no interpreter, have him remain silent|
                                        |in church,” to mean that there should be no speaking in tongues in church whatsoever unaccompanied by|
                                        |an interpretation. For this reason, Paul added the second half of v. 28 to allow speaking in tongues|
                                        |done without interpretation, as long as it’s done quietly (i.e. <char style="it">to himself</char>).|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Many claim that the Bible commands that all speaking in tongues must be followed by an interpretation,|
                                        |but there’s not a single example of a message in tongues followed by an interpretation when one closely|
                                        |examines every instance of speaking in tongues in Acts. In fact, in each of those instances, not only|
                                        |was there no interpretation given, but everyone was speaking in tongues at the same time. None of those|
                                        |who were speaking in tongues in Acts are “outsiders” (see above note), so it’s alright for them all to|
                                        |speak in tongues at the same time since they’ll all be self-edified.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Furthermore, as v. 28 says “…have him remain silent in church…” but also says “…let him speak to himself|
                                        |and to God,” we should infer that what Paul meant by “remain silent in the church” is actually a command|
                                        |to not speak in a loud voice so as to address the congregation rather than a command to not speak at|
                                        |all—otherwise, how can such a person simultaneously remain silent and speak to himself? This observation|
                                        |gains importance later on in this chapter when Paul talks about women keeping silent in church. The same|
                                        |applies in that case for women: he’s not saying that women can’t talk at all in church, rather he’s saying|
                                        |women shouldn’t talk out loud in a way that they address the entire congregation. This observation makes|
                                        |sense, as the problem in the Corinthian church was multiple parties trying to speak to the entire congregation|
                                        |at the same time, talking over top of each other—one speaking to himself or speaking in a subdued voice|
                                        |was not the problem.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">the spirits of prophets are subordinate to and take directions from prophets</char>…Regardless|
                                        |of whether prophets have been given the unction from the Holy Spirit to prophecy, the may choose not|
                                        |to, and this is not a slight against the Holy Spirit. This passage insinuates that a prophet will receive|
                                        |such unction but will have to wait his turn to deliver it. Put another way, the Holy Spirit will at times|
                                        |give unctions to multiple people at the same time, but it’s up to them to deliver these messages serially.|

     G                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Continuing on in vv. 35–36, Paul says it’s disgraceful for a woman to speak in church. Paul’s statement|
                                        |“If they want to learn something in particular, let them ask their husbands at home” implies that the|
                                        |women were disrupting the entire church by interrupting the speaker with a question. Not only were they|
                                        |interrupting the speaker, Paul’s remark, “did the word of God issue forth from you (etc),” indicates|
                                        |that their questions did not come from a sincere, humble desire to learn but from a position of arrogance,|
                                        |from a know-it-all attitude. These reasons are why Paul said it was disgraceful for the women (these|
                                        |women) to speak in church.|
     G                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But we know that women were permitted to speak in church at that time, since Acts 21:9 mentions four|
                                        |young women who prophesied. In order to prophesy, these women would have to do so in a church setting,|
                                        |and doing so meant that they were addressing the congregation while prophesying. This fourteenth chapter|
                                        |plus the ancient treatise called the <char style="it">Didache </char>indicate that the first century|
                                        |church had prophets stand up and address the congregation in prophesies on a regular basis—something|
                                        |which is radically different than even what Pentecostals do nowadays. I imagine that the four daughters|
                                        |of Acts 21:9 took their turn at the pulpit.|

                                        |for positions of authority and the like. The first three correspond to what’s quoted here:|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Ruler [archōn, <char style="w" strong="G00758">ἄρχων</char>)]—When referring to people, the very top|
                                        |of a hierarchy; the one who has the ultimate power over the entire hierarchy. It refers to a person or|
                                        |the people who are at the top of the pyramid, whatever that pyramid may be. It’s translated <char style="it">principalities|
                                        |</char>in Eph. 6:12 (KJV), and in that case does not refer to people but refers to demons, demons who|
                                        |are at the top of some demonic hierarchy. When referring to time, it’s the very start or beginning of|
                                        |an epoch of time, sometimes spoken of abstractly when the start of time isn’t known (John 1:1). The KJV|
                                        |translates this as <char style="it">prince </char>instead of the NASB’s <char style="it">ruler </char>in|
                                        |places such as John 16:11, etc. See below for more on <char style="it">prince</char>.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Authority [eksousia, <char style="w" strong="G01849">ἐξουσία</char>)]—The literal meaning is <char style="it">existing|
                                        |out of. </char>Power which is given to a person to act on behalf of a hierarchy, government, etc. which|
                                        |has the ultimate power. Also, one who’s given the legitimate right to exercise power. Also, the power|
                                        |itself, with the understanding that it was granted in such a way and not simply usurped; the position,|
                                        |the seat itself.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Power [dunamis, <char style="w" strong="G01411">δύναμις</char>)]—The natural, inherent capability to|
                                        |exercise control over others. The ability may or may not be legitimate or have been granted by the government|
                                        |or hierarchy. The word <char style="it">power </char>simply states the capability to exercise power,|
                                        |but does not specify where this ability comes from, whether the power is transferrable, or what the nature|
                                        |of it is; whereas the word <char style="it">authority</char>, while in certain contexts simply refers|
                                        |to power, is, in its essence, power which is derived from the main body; power delegated; legitimate|
                                        |power; non-usurped power. Therefore, dunamis may refer to usurped power or illegitimate power.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Leader [haegemon, <char style="w" strong="G02232">ἡγεμών</char>)]—This has two similar meanings. First|
                                        |is the Latin <char style="it">dux</char>: it’s the one who’s the leader; who takes charge and leads the|
                                        |way for others to follow; the commander, the one who not only makes the decisions everyone follows but|
                                        |is responsible for those decisions, whom everyone relies on to ensure that the decisions are intelligently|
                                        |made. The second is the Latin <char style="it">princeps</char>: the one who does a thing first. The princeps|
                                        |is the person who’s the most eminent, most distinguished, the first person; the leading citizen of the|
                                        |country; the person who’s the best at something and therefore has taken the lead; the person everyone|
                                        |relies on the most to lead the way when facing difficulties. In modern terms, the captain of a sports|
                                        |team is a princeps: the best player, and as the best takes the initiative the most, and as a result of|
                                        |taking the initiative, he’s the one who leads and drives the others to victory.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Dominion [kuriotās, <char style="w" strong="G02963">κυριότης</char>)]—The literal meaning is <char style="it">the|
                                        |nature of lordship</char>. It is “the majestic power that a lord wields, ruling power, lordship, dominion”|
                                        |(Danker &amp; Bauer). The nature of lordship is the assumption that the expected order of things is for|
                                        |there to be a lord and that this lord will rule over others, and that there are guidelines by which this|
                                        |is done, either codified in law or in an unspoken understanding. As this word is derived from <char style="it">lord</char>,|
                                        |it follows that it refers to the powers a lord has and the way that he obtained them. Unlike the word|
                                        |<char style="it">authority, </char>a lord is not a ruler who derives his power from the government, but|
                                        |rather is like the owner of a large private estate, say, somewhere out in a remote rural area. In a feudal|
                                        |system this would include a dukedom or earldom, but a lordship can be much smaller also. Those who live|
                                        |in remote, rural areas are in many respects autonomous from the rest of society, including the government.|
                                        |While the lord rules like an authority (eksousia), his sphere of power doesn’t fall under the authority|
                                        |to another, so within his sphere he’s not answerable to anyone else. As expected, this also refers to|
                                        |a lordship seat which is transferrable, like from father to son, etc.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Throne[(thronos, <char style="w" strong="G02362">θρόνος</char>)]—A ruler whose powers extend to sitting|
                                        |on a judgment seat: arbitrating disputes, acting as a judge in a civil or criminal proceeding; receiving|
                                        |emissaries; forming policy, including do so with the advice of a counsel. The throne is not an ad-hoc|
                                        |judgment seat, but is a persistent seat, passed from person to person. As is apparent, there’s overlap|
                                        |in these terms for rulers.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Pastor/shepherd [poimān, <char style="w" strong="G04166">ποιμήν</char>)]—(Ref. note of 1 Pet. 5:2). This|
                                        |Old Testament word means <char style="it">leader</char>, but the implication is that this person is leading|
                                        |ordinary people (sheep) and not soldiers under his chain of command. The sheep-analogy means that such|
                                        |a leader will have to deal with problems that are eradicated in an army due to the discipline instilled|
                                        |into that army. The problems Moses had to deal with when leading Israel in the wilderness are analogous|
                                        |to a shepherd over sheep. Since poimān has its roots in the Old Testament, the word is only used in conjunction|
                                        |with ecclesiastical leadership.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |To come forward as a leader [proistāmi,<char style="w" strong="G04291">προΐστημι</char>)]—This appears|
                                        |in the NT as a verb but is also used substantively as a noun. It literally means <char style="it">to|
                                        |stand forward</char>, and appears in Rom. 12:8; 1 Thess. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17. Danker &amp; Bauer defines|
                                        |it first, “to exercise a position of leadership, rule direct, be at the head of,” and second, “to have|
                                        |an interest in, show concern for, care for, give aid.” There are only three occurrences in the NT and|
                                        |all are in relation to church leadership. |
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Steward [oikonomos, <char style="w" strong="G03623">οἰκονόμος</char>)]—Someone whom a lord (the ruler|
                                        |of a sizeable estate) puts in charge of the affairs of the estate. Luke 12:42; 16:1; Titus 1:7 are examples.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Overseer, bishop [episkopos, <char style="w" strong="G01985">ἐπίσκοπος</char>)]—The Gk. word means “one|
                                        |who visits,” more specifically, “one who checks up on things to ensure that things are in order”; hence|
                                        |the NASB rendering <char style="it">episkopos</char> as <char style="it">overseer</char>. What we nowadays|
                                        |call a “head pastor.” Someone who’s the single individual who’s the head over a congregation. This position|
                                        |didn’t exist in the early days of the church, as the early church was ruled by elder councils, probably|
                                        |imitating the way that synagogues were ruled by elders. Apparently, as Christianity diverged more and|
                                        |more from Judaism, the forms of church government diverged as well, with churches replacing elder councils|
                                        |with bishops. |
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Deacon [diakonos, <char style="w" strong="G01249">διάκονος</char>)]—A deacon is a leader (a poiman) in|
                                        |the church who has oversight over a specific area in the church, but does not have total oversight like|
                                        |a bishop does. Deacons existed in both elder-ruled and bishop-ruled churches. Nowadays, we call a deacon|
                                        |an associate pastor or a ministry director. A deacon is similar to a steward (see how these two words|
                                        |are used together in Col 1:25) but applied to a church context, as the word’s used in the NT. Deacon|
                                        |appears in Rom. 12:7; 1 Cor. 16:15; Eph. 6:21; 1 Tim 3:10.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Slave or servant [doulos, <char style="w" strong="G01401">δοῦλος</char>)]—This word is translated either|
                                        |servant or slave. As slavery was pervasive in the ancient world, most of the times a <char style="it">doulos</char>|
                                        |is a slave, but since the slavery-mindset is absent from us in modern times, we must make distinctions|
                                        |in this word. This word means a servant, a menial servant, one who takes orders and is not entrusted|
                                        |with any significant responsibilities. This word means a slave, someone who’s owned by another person;|
                                        |someone who’s locked into this position; forced servitude. Doulos as appears in the NT can refer to one|
                                        |or multiple of these definitions, and the most appropriate rendering is dictated by context. In the NT,|
                                        |a doulos can be a menial servant without specifically or explicitly referring to someone who’s locked|
                                        |into slavery, i.e. owned by another person. In this respect, a person who’s “locked into” a nine-to-five|
                                        |job is a doulos of a sort, even though he’s not a bona fide slave.|

                                        |on behalf of the dead</char>. Translators and commentators are puzzled at the meaning of this. Some guess-work|
                                        |is required. A good explanation from one of the commentators is that an interpolation was intended, one|
                                        |which changes <char style="it">the dead </char>to <char style="it">the resurrection of the dead. </char>Also,|
                                        |the prepositional phrase usually translated <char style="it">on behalf of </char>has been bent from its|
                                        |traditional meaning to mean something that symbolizes something else. Also, the verb <char style="it">to|
                                        |baptize </char>seems to acquire some middle voice usage, but that’s speculative. Those who disagree with|
                                        |these explanations—and there are several good reasons to do so—are welcome to explain how their interpretation|

     v12                                |the lifestyle we led in the world (i.e., among those who aren’t believers) was by God’s simplicity and|

     v12                                |God tainted by the carnal nature) but by God’s grace instead—and that lifestyle was all the more so with|

                                        |were used in ancient times the same way they are today, howbeit for the occasional different application.|

                                        |a remote destination was handed a scroll which was sealed. The sealing more than likely was a hot wax|
                                        |dripped across the overlapping edges of the scroll, so that when the wax cooled and hardened, the scroll|

                                        |opened, cannot be closed again and how, if it was opened, it would be apparent. In addition, the wax,|
                                        |while still hot, was stamped with a stamp or a signet ring which had a detailed image etched into it|
                                        |which became imprinted into the wax, so that the cooled wax retained this image. The receiver would inspect|
                                        |the image to make sure it was genuine, as only a limited set of stamps or signet rings would be made.|

                                        |and they assumed that the spiritual world, which includes heaven itself, is simply a layer on top of|
                                        |another layer. So the Gk. word<char style="it"> </char>for <char style="it">heaven </char>conflates a|
                                        |couple of concepts we do not. The first of the “heavens” is the sky above. The second heaven-layer, being|
                                        |above that of course, is where the sun, the moon, and the stars exist. We call it outer-space, but they|
                                        |assumed that these astronomical objects were closer to the earth than they actually are. They assumed|
                                        |that the sun travelled across the sky each day in the second “heaven.” So the third heaven is the layer|
                                        |above the second, but since the second includes all physical objects (and from our perspective extends|
                                        |to the far reaches of the universe), the third layer steps into the spirit-world. Now, is this spirit-world|
                                        |heaven as we know it? Paul calls it <char style="it">paradise </char>in v.4, so it may be. Ref. notes|

                                        |is not used literally in any of the aforementioned references. This idiom was originally used to describe|
                                        |the vexation which came from the enemy nations which surrounded Israel. In fact, Paul goes on to state|
                                        |exactly what this idiom refers to in an appositive phrase a few words after: it is an “agent of Satan.”|

                                        |10:9 for example), but at other times means weakness as the English word suggests. When asthenia is used|
                                        |to mean sickness, it refers to a prolonged, undiagnosed ailment which lasts for a long time and causes|

                                        |dire need, persecutions, and circumstances of distress”—none of which are a sickness of any sort. This|

                                        |one must perform miracles, healings, or something of a supernatural nature. This is because Philip (Acts|
                                        |21:8) is the only evangelist that the NT identifies by name, so his example must serve as the archetype|
                                        |for all evangelists. In other words, since Philip performed miracles, and Philip is the only evangelist|
                                        |in the Bible, all evangelists must perform miracles in order to conform to the strictest definition laid|

     v 7                                |for the fact that there are certain individuals among you who are trouble-makers, wanting to distort|

     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |nor were we taught it by anyone, but rather we were taught it through a Jesus Christ-revelation.|
 +   V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, you heard about the way I used to live back then when I lived as a strict Jew, that I was caught|
     v13                                |up in persecuting God’s church to an inordinate degree and in wreaking havoc on it, |

     v14                                |as I had become even more fanatical about all the man-made rules and regulations that were passed down|

     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |to reveal His son in me so I’d evangelize him to the Gentiles, I didn’t drop everything I was doing and|

     v 2                                |message—the Gospel—which I preach among the Gentiles. But I submitted this in private to those who’re|
     v 2                                |considered to be the leading figures of the movement, lest somehow all of this be a huge waste of time|

     v 9                                |by me) that was given to me, James, Peter, and John (those considered to be the key players and head|

 +   V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Now when Peter came to Antioch, I confronted him point-blank because he was in the wrong. |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, prior to when select individuals from the churches under James’s authority arrived, he partook|
     v12                                |of meals with the Gentiles, but when they arrived, he withdrew from the Gentiles and kept himself at|
     v12                                |a distance from them, fearing those from the circumcision (i.e., those who believe that one must obey|
     v12                                |the Law of Moses and adopt Jewish rules and restrictions in order to be accepted by God; those who say|

     V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was caught up in the hypocrisy…|

     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |having reached the point where we know for certain that a person isn’t justified (i.e., God examining|
     v16                                |a person’s righteousness like a judge would and declaring them to be righteous) as a result of works|

     v17                                |you can’t seriously believe that Christ has been delegated the responsibility of caring for and promoting|

     v20                                |human ability, and in contention with my carnal nature), I live by faith for the son of God who loved|

     V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I’m not nullifying the grace of God: if one is justified through law, Christ really did die for nothing.“|

                                        |for him. This passage starting from v. 1 draws an analogy between a child who is born the son of the|
                                        |lord of a great estate but is raised no differently than a household slave. Once he reaches an age of|
                                        |maturity, he joins his father and becomes a joint-owner of the estate. Jesus underwent this process by|

                                        |redacting of the manuscripts in this area goes to show how difficult vv. 12–16 are to make sense of.|

                                        |wanted to pluck out their eyes and give them to Paul out of sympathy. As difficult as the passage of|
                                        |vv. 12–16 is to interpret, a healthy skepticism is in order. But the context of this passage doesn’t|
                                        |confirm this dubious claim. Verse 15 begins, “why aren’t you happy anymore?”, while verse 16 begins,|
                                        |“So this means I’ve become your enemy…?” No concurrence is found ; the context suggests that this is|

                                        |the Bible, cities are metonymies for a concentration of those who intensely believe and put into practice|

                                        |expect to obtain righteousness by adhering to the Law, whereas the Jerusalem above represents righteousness|

                                        |size of a grown-man’s body. The comparison to a full-grown body continues in the phrase <char style="it">to|

                                        |has a full-grown body. The metaphor is that, when our body is fully grown, we will have attained the|
                                        |same height and weight as Christ. The reference to children in v. 14 continues this stature-metaphor.|

                                        |</char>and <char style="it">once and for all </char>are insinuated by these tenses. Also, as these two|
                                        |verbs are imperatives, a present-tense imperative is softer than an aorist-imperative. So the command|
                                        |<char style="it">to put on </char>is like an order that an army captain would give to one of his soldiers|
                                        |or that a lord would give to one of his slaves. So the command to put on the new-self is more urgent,|

                                        |the other hand, Jesus earned this by his obedience. Though the word <char style="it">gave </char>as used|
                                        |here points to God’s generosity, it does not negate the fact that Jesus earned a name above every name.|
                                        |God’s generosity was in the fact that He is willing to bestow an enormous amount of power on another|
                                        |person of the Trinity, not holding it for Himself. This is a reason why the three persons in the Trinity|
                                        |are one instead of three. Islam denies the Trinity because it says that the three persons in the Trinity|
                                        |would compete for power, but the insinuation in the word <char style="it">give </char>here is that God|
                                        |the Father out of His generosity won’t vie for power but instead hands it over to the Son.|

     v 5                                |only but also in supernatural power and in the Holy Spirit and with much conviction, just as you know|

     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |rather, having suffered before and having been treated with insolence (as you’re well aware), in Philippi|
     v 2                                |we were emboldened in our God to tell you God’s good-news message, the Gospel, while in the face of a|
     v 2                                |lot of opposition. |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, our encouragement was not from us being in error or from an uncleanness (i.e., something dirty,|
     v 3                                |impure, or something one should stay away from), nor did it exist in deceit or guile, |
     V 4              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |but instead it’s in line with the way we’ve been granted by God to be entrusted with the Gospel—that’s|
     v 4                                |the way we speak, not like we’re speaking to people in a way where we’re trying to make them happy but|
     v 4                                |like we’re speaking to God in a way to make Him happy instead, Who approves or disapproves of what’s|

     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |For there was never a time when we showed up with a flattering message (as you’re well aware), nor did|

     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |though, as Christ’s apostles, we’re capable of throwing our weight around. Instead, we became infants|
     v 7                                |while in your midst. The way a nursing mother cherishes her own children |
     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |is the same way that we, having a strong yearning for you, thought it well to share not only the Gospel|
     v 8                                |of God but also the things that make us live and breathe themselves. Therefore, you became dear to us.|
 +   V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Furthermore, recollect, comrades, our back-breaking labor and toil: we worked day and night so that we|
     v 9                                |wouldn’t be a burden on any of you. Under these circumstances we preached the Gospel of God to you. |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You—and God—can attest to just how pious, correct, and faultless the demeanor was that we presented to|

     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Just as you know from experience that we treated each one of you like a father treats his own children,|
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |we were comforting, exhorting, advising, consoling, cheering, and issuing statements for you to conduct|

 +   V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |And we thank God continuously because of this as well, since, having received (i.e., wholeheartedly embraced)|
     v13                                |God’s message (His systematic reasoning; His word) verbally communicated from us to you, you didn’t receive|
     v13                                |a man-made message but instead you received it just as it actually is: God’s true message, a message|
     v13                                |which is also at work in you who believe.|
 +   V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see comrades, you followed the pattern set by the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea,|
     v14                                |in that you too suffered the same things done to you by your own countrymen like what was done to them|
     v14                                |by their fellow Judeans, |
     V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |who also killed the Lord Jesus and the Old Testament prophets and persecuted us. These countrymen live|
     v15                                |lives which are not pleasing to God; they are against all of humanity, |
     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |hindering us from getting to speak to the Gentiles so that they could be saved (i.e., receive Christ|
     v16                                |as savior), the end-result being that every time they commit sin, they do it to the maximum extent; the|

 +   V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In conclusion, comrades, we ask you in the Lord—plead with you—that you go to higher and higher levels|
     v 1                                |in your being pleasing to God in your day to day lives in a way which is consistent with the instructions|
     v 1                                |you received from us (which is consistent with the way you are currently living your lives). |
     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The fact of the matter is that you know some of the instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.|
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, this is the will of God (your holiness is the will of God!): it is for you to abstain from the|
     v 3                                |fornication you’re surrounded by (i.e., by the loose sexual morals we all know about); |
     V 4              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |for each of you to know how to gain possession and keep possession of his own personal container (i.e.,|
     v 4                                |his body, the container for his soul and spirit) in holiness and dignity, |
     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |not in an intense, all-consuming feeling of lust (just like the Gentiles who don’t know God) |
     V 6              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |but in not stepping out of line and taking advantage of or defrauding his fellow-comrade in the matter|
     v 6                                |of sexual morality. Because of this the Lord takes vengeance in issues pertaining to these transgressions,|
     v 6                                |consistent with the way we told you previously, telling it in a dead-serious manner. |
     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The fact of the matter is that God has not called you to uncleanness (i.e., God’s intention for your|
     v 7                                |life in His kingdom was not to commit filthy, disgusting deeds) but rather to live in holiness. |
     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Consequently, he who disregards this command isn’t disregarding a human being but is disregarding God|
     v 8                                |instead, Who gives His Holy Spirit to you.|
 +   V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Now about brotherly-love (i.e., having strong likings for other comrades): you don’t need to have any|
     v 9                                |instruction or advice written to you on this subject, seeing that you yourselves are God-instructed in|
     v 9                                |the love one should have for another. |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, you also extend the same practices to all the comrades all over Macedonia. We beg you, comrades,|
     v10                                |to do even more |
     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and make it a goal to be still (i.e., not be stirred by loud, negative emotions), to do your own things|
     v11                                |(i.e., concentrate on your own lives), and to work with your own hands (i.e., don’t rely on others to|
     v11                                |do your work), and do these things in line with the way we recommended, |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |so that the way you conduct your lives would leave a good impression on those on the outside and so that|
     v12                                |you won’t need anything.|
 +   V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |We don’t want you to be kept in the dark, comrades, about those who sleep (i.e., the believers who are|
     v13                                |already dead), so that you won’t grieve like the others, the ones who have no hope. |
     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To this point, if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead, then we are also entitled to believe|
     v14                                |that God will take those who sleep through Jesus (i.e., those who died trusting in Jesus) along together|
     v14                                |with him the same way. |
     V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In fact, we’re telling you this in a word of the Lord (i.e., in a prophetic message from the Lord): you|
     v15                                |the living who remain on the Earth until the coming of the Lord will absolutely not arrive at the destination|

     V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |because the Lord himself—with the shout of a command by the voice of an archangel and by God’s bugle|
     v16                                |call—will come down from heaven, and first the dead in Christ will be resurrected (i.e., brought back|
     v16                                |to life), |
     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |then you who are alive who remain on the Earth will be taken together with them as a single unit into|
     v17                                |the clouds to a meeting with the Lord in the air—And that’s the way we’ll always be with the Lord.|
 +   V18              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The bottom line is that we should comfort and exhort each other with these words.|

                                        |[<char style="it">lust</char>]. It’s normal for a person to have sexual desire, even a strong desire,|
                                        |but Paul’s talking about a desire that’s been amplified beyond normal amounts of sexual desire (strong|
                                        |as that may be). The Gk. word <char style="it">passion </char>is also used to describe the passion of|
                                        |the pain and suffering of death, like the passion of Christ when he was crucified—this is how strong|
                                        |of a word it is. Sexual predators and sex offenders reach this point, the point where their passion of|
                                        |desire takes control of them and they commit criminal acts. A couple notches down, it will also cause|
                                        |the ordinary person to conduct immoral acts.|

                                        |the matter</char>…Applying logic to this statement here from v. 6 in relationship to the passage as a|
                                        |whole, Paul is telling those in the church not to “defraud” their fellow brother in Christ, and this|
                                        |in relationship to sexual morals. There are two possibilities: first, Paul could be talking about a man|
                                        |having an affair with another man’s wife. Second, Paul could be talking about a man sleeping with the|
                                        |young, unmarried daughter of another man. I believe it’s more likely that Paul is talking about the former|
                                        |than the latter. Therefore, the definition of <char style="it">the fornication </char>(v. 3) is adulterous|
                                        |liaisons. This added with the additional evidence from 1 Cor. 5:1 suggest that the word <char style="it">fornication|
                                        |</char>as used in the NT is talking about grossly immoral sexual acts. Or, put another way, when Paul|
                                        |addresses the issue here and in 1 Cor. 5:1, he’s talking about something which is grossly immoral. The|
                                        |church, however, makes no distinction between sexual acts which are grossly immoral and those which are|
                                        |mildly immoral when applying the word <char style="it">fornication. </char>They should.|

                                        |Lineberry. Their reasoning for choosing “departure” over “a falling away” is that <char style="it">aphistāmi|
                                        |</char><char style="w" strong="G00868">ἀφίστημι</char>)<char style="it">, </char>the root verb from which|
                                        |apostasia is derived, means <char style="it">to depart. </char>Furthermore, they say that <char style="it">apostasia|
                                        |</char>(the noun form) only occurs twice in the NT, here in 1 Thess. 2:3 and over in Acts 21:21. Although|
                                        |the context of Acts 21:21 suggests that apostasia means “falling away” rather than “departure,” the critics|
                                        |claim that this isn’t sufficient evidence to negate the core meaning of aphistāmi. However, what these|
                                        |dissenters fail to take into consideration is the use of apostasia in the LXX. Apostasia is found in|
                                        |Josh. 22:22; 2 Chron. 29:19; 2 Chron. 33:19; Jer. 2:19. In all four cases, apostasia means “rebellion,|
                                        |unfaithfulness, backsliding.” In other words, it means the same thing as “a falling away from the faith.”|
                                        |Paul read from the LXX frequently and extensively (it might’ve even been his primary study-Bible), and|
                                        |he was familiar with the occurrences and usages of apostasia in these passages and was mimicking its|
                                        |usage here in v. 3. But in any case, between the LXX and Acts. 21:21, there are five occurrences of apostasia|
                                        |in the Bible apart from 2:3 here. In five of the five occurrences—100% of the time—the meaning of apostasia|
                                        |is “a falling away from the faith.” The sixth must mean the same also, the one here in v. 3.|

                                        |what Paul writes here is identical to what Peter writes in 1 Pet. 3:3, this implies that this was a problem|
                                        |in the early church. Since Paul precedes this by saying that women should dress in good taste, modestly,|
                                        |and exercise good judgment and self-control, it stands to reason that these hairstyling, jewelry, and|
                                        |expensive clothes were not considered to be good taste, modest, or indicative of one exercising good|
                                        |judgment. Since we in modern times don’t consider the use of hairstyling, jewelry, etc. to be bad taste|
                                        |or indicative of a lack of judgment (except for a few very conservative denominations, most of which|
                                        |have reversed their position), this warrants closer examination. |
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Let’s assume that the amount of gold in piece a jewelry is equivalent to the gold in a Roman Aureus (8g|
                                        |of gold), which was valued at 25 Denarii, and let’s assume each Denarius represented a day’s labor. If|
                                        |there are 312 working days in a years, this represents around 8% of a laborer’s annual income. So from|
                                        |the perspective of us in modern times, if a person earns $50,000 a year, an 8g piece of gold jewelry|
                                        |would cost around $5000 in today’s money (and the same 8g of gold goes for around $500 nowadays). This|
                                        |means that gold jewelry was more expensive for them back then that it is for us, as this hypothetical|
                                        |example shows an 8-to-1 difference then to now.|

                                        |may be that these women were spending outrageous amounts of money on their dress, and from the remarks|
                                        |Peter and Paul made, were investing their self-image in their ability to dress lavishly and were trying|

     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The lesson that modern-day Christian women should learn is to recognize the root-problems here and not|
                                        |be so concerned about the letter of the law. Women shouldn’t be obsessed with dressing in clothing that|
                                        |they can’t afford, trying to imitate those in the world who live an ungodly life, or base their self-image|

                                        |is resolved by context. When Paul leaves instructions for the anār and the gunaika in Ephesians and Colossians,|
                                        |the context is obvious: the rendering is husband and wife. Here also the rendering is context-dependent.|
                                        |Is Paul talking about husbands and wives or men and women? Most translations choose men and women. To|
                                        |justify it being husbands and wives, there must be something in the context that indicates that this|
                                        |is the case. The evidence in that favor is that vv. 11,12 are similar to 1 Cor. 14:33–36, which we know|
                                        |was addressed to wives. Also, v. 15 talks about bearing children, which means that it’s addressed to|
                                        |wives. The subject is omitted from the sentence of v. 15, relying on the verb conjugation in conjunction|
                                        |with the context to insinuate that the subject is <char style="it">she. </char>It Gk., it’s not common|
                                        |to have the subject omitted entirely. In lieu of its total omission, a definite article is used as a|
                                        |pronoun, as a definite article is short, perhaps is even a proclitic. But by omitting the subject entirely,|
                                        |the writer assumes that the reader knows beyond any doubt that the subject to be used is easily insinuated|
                                        |by the context. Such is the case. Through this insinuation, v. 15 is tightly bound to the context. Therefore,|
                                        |since v. 15 addresses wives, not women, coupled with the similarity between this passage and 1 Cor. 14:33–36,|
                                        |one may put forth a weighty argument that the entire context of vv. 11–15 is of wives specifically, not|
                                        |of women in general.|

                                        |for this reason are less qualified to be instructors. In spite of this, Titus 1:3 allows women to be|

                                        |the garden, Adam was not deceived when he partook of the forbidden fruit, and this makes his sin more|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">bishop</char>…Ref. note of 1 Cor. 15:24. As vv. 5–6 address qualifications for elders|
                                        |and v. 7 begins with a coordinating conjunction, it stands to reason that, at least for the churches|
                                        |Titus was dealing with, elders were bishops and vice-versa. This supports the theory that the ancient|
                                        |church was originally run by elders but later on transitioned to one which was run by bishops instead.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">”Cretans are always liars, vicious brutes, and fat blimps”</char>…From the sounds of|
                                        |it, this prophet was parroting an outrageously false, negative ethnic stereotype about Cretans, which|
                                        |the prophet categorically applies to all Cretans. Paul is vehemently condemning that kind of language.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">clean</char>…Also: <char style="it">pure</char>. Paul’s usage of clean and defiled here|
                                        |is a metaphor to the OT concepts of clean and unclean, concepts which are deeply rooted in the Law of|
                                        |Moses and touch all the temple rituals and quite a lot of other things. Once something was defiled (tainted),|
                                        |it could no longer be used in the temple service. Care had to be taken to keep or maintain people or|
                                        |things in a state of cleanness.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The metaphor presented here is that a person who’s clean is one who’s pure in mind and spirit, and everything|
                                        |that person handles is automatically clean. A person who’s pure will look at any fact, teaching, philosophy,|
                                        |etc. and come up with practical applications, anecdotes, life-lessons, analogies, etc. which are pure,|
                                        |meaning they’ll support or complement Christian truths, principles, and values. But anyone who’s defiled,|
                                        |any fact, teaching, philosophy, etc. will ultimately lead to something twisted, to the point of contradicting|
                                        |Christian truths, principles, and values.|

                                        |hagnos. So the words should be more closely examined. The root-meaning of hagnos is separation. In the|
                                        |OT, things which were holy were separated from the unclean in order to preserve their holiness. This|
                                        |is hagnos. So when hagnos is used in reference to women, it’s talking about a separation—a separation|
                                        |even from men in a sexual way. This is how it’s acquired the means of <char style="it">chaste </char>(meaning|
                                        |kept sexually separate) in this verse here. Paul might’ve meant chaste exclusively and not pure or holy—we|

                                        |hand, the omission of the definite article may be just that: the equivalent of (Gk. has none) an indefinite|
                                        |article (or perhaps none at all) is what was intended and what’s being conveyed; the definite was not|
                                        |intended. Though I’m not insisting that this is correct, I do favor the latter, the deciding factor being|

                                        |to be</char>. Naturally, its meaning is decided by context. Something else which is noteworthy is that|
                                        |the infinite <char style="it">inherit </char>has a verb tense which insinuates ongoing action, as opposed|
                                        |to a one-time action. So the heirs are about to be inheriting, going to be inheriting, or destined to|
                                        |be inheriting salvation on an ongoing basis. This begs the question, what does <char style="it">salvation|
                                        |</char>mean in this context? Many Christians, scholars, and translators assume it means “receiving Christ|
                                        |in the new birth” or something similar. When applying this definition to this verse, the dilemma is that|
                                        |the angels are sent to assist only those who are about to or are going to inherit salvation, not those|
                                        |who already have inherited it, as the word <char style="it">mellō </char>refers to something which is|
                                        |going to happen in the future but hasn’t happened yet. For this reason, in this verse the word <char|
                                        |style="it">salvation </char>does not mean receiving Christ in the new birth, but it means being rescued|
                                        |from catastrophe. This is its core meaning anyways, so the only surprise should be that Christian scholars|
                                        |failed to apply it properly in the first place. The last piece to the puzzle is the meaning of <char|
                                        |style="it">inherit. </char>The Gk. and English meanings are essentially the same: it means coming and|
                                        |actually possessing what’s been set aside as yours, what’s rightfully yours. Inheriting salvation here|
                                        |is not being born-again some time in the future, but it means coming into the relief in a dire situation|
                                        |of that which is rightfully yours, a person who is already a Christ-follower. Angels are sent to assist|
                                        |Christ-followers with coming into the relief which is rightfully theirs, and to come into this relief|
                                        |on an ongoing basis.|

                                        |from the outside, as opposed to goodness which exists on the inside of someone. The goodness is perceived|
                                        |from the outside through the faculties of perception spoken of here. But in practical terms, what the|
                                        |writer of Hebrews is referring to is a person who through practice and experience is able to observe|
                                        |a given situation and through little pieces of information gleaned here and there is able to see the|
                                        |good and the evil in that situation, and distinguish between the two. One example is this: years ago|
                                        |my brother-in-law used to top by my mother-in-law’s apartment briefly, bring friends occasionally, and|
                                        |after listening to these guys talk casually a bit could tell if they were no good or not. She was always|
                                        |right. Another example: I’m thinking of a well-known evangelist who had a huge ministry who died a few|
                                        |years ago. Just about everyone in the city in which he lived either praised him as a great saint who|
                                        |could do no wrong or condemned him as a horrible sinner who could do no right. The truth is that he was|
                                        |a mixture of both good and bad, but hardly anyone in the city would say that that was the case. The problem,|
                                        |you see, is that they couldn’t distinguish good from bad.|

                                        |derived from the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char><char style="w" strong="G00907">βαπτίζω</char>).|
                                        |The connection to the word <char style="it">baptism </char>is obvious; nearly every (perhaps every) rendering|
                                        |of <char style="it">baptism </char>in English comes from these words. Some translations like the NASB|
                                        |render this “instructions about washings,” which is incorrect. First, the words “instructions about”|
                                        |are an interpolation (that is to say, they don’t exist in the GT and were added to make sense of the|
                                        |text). Second, “instructions about washings” are covered in “repentance from dead works”; no need to|
                                        |cover it again. Third, the context decides any ambiguity. This word <char style="it">baptismos</char>|
                                        |appears four times in the NT, here and in 2 Cor. 2:12; Mark 7:4; Heb. 9:10. The times in which it means|
                                        |a dipping in water or ceremonial washings are obvious by the context. As this passage is about “fundamental|
                                        |doctrines,” is not baptism a fundamental doctrine? Have their not been entire denominational splits over|
                                        |this issue? Is it not a pillar of the Christian faith? Fourth, although <char style="it">baptismos </char>as|
                                        |used in the NT is context-variable, the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char>is mostly used to refer|
                                        |to baptism. Fifth, those who render <char style="it">baptismos</char> as “instructions about washings”|
                                        |do so primarily to avoid the obvious fact that this word is plural (baptisms) not singular (baptism).|
                                        |They do so because they believe there is only one type of baptism relevant to the church today, namely|
                                        |water baptism, and if they were to render this word literally as what it obviously is—baptisms—they would|
                                        |they would be forced to acknowledge that there is a second baptism, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and|
                                        |that this baptism wasn’t just for the early church but is for believers today.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">eternal judgment</char>…The “fundamental doctrines of Christ” should be understood as|
                                        |the essential doctrines of Christianity. A brief description: “repentance from dead works” is the abandonment|
                                        |of the notion that obeying the Law of Moses or any other list of rules is your ticket to obtaining righteousness.|
                                        |This is coupled with “faith in God”: that we obtain righteousness by faith. As these are the crux of|
                                        |Paul’s message, the writer of Hebrews was at a minimum a disciple of Paul. Next are the “doctrines”:|
                                        |baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead coupled with eternal judgment. The doctrine|
                                        |of baptisms is that a person who accepts Christ as Savior should be immediately baptized in water without|
                                        |delay. Also, there is a second baptism which occurs after accepting Christ, that is the baptism in the|
                                        |Holy Spirit. It is accompanied by speaking in tongues. The doctrine of the laying on of hands institutes|
                                        |a holy ordinance for the church to practice in the form of one or several believers placing their hands|
                                        |on another believer while at the same time praying. This was done in the Bible for praying for the sick,|
                                        |for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and for ordination into the ministry. The next doctrine is the resurrection|
                                        |of the dead, which in the NT refers to life after death. The doctrine asserts that we don’t cease to|
                                        |exist when we die, but that we live on eternally in another life, in another body, be it eternal bliss|
                                        |or eternal damnation. The final doctrine, one which connect s to the previous, is eternal judgment: that|
                                        |when our lives are over, we will stand before God in judgment, the outcome for which will be rewards|
                                        |and punishments.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">unable to engage again in the process of renewing themselves with the goal of repentance|
                                        |in mind</char>…The verb tense in the infinitive <char style="it">renew </char>speaks of the process of|

                                        |of changing. His will is altered to where he will not change again. It’s not that God cannot forgive|
                                        |him, it’s that he will never, ever change. The once-saved-always-saved teaching should be reconsidered|

                                        |wording of the GT, the term “Holy of Holies” is introduced in 9:3, and the GT literally reads “holy of|
                                        |holies.” Thenceforth, however, the author of Hebrews shortens the literal phrase from <char style="it">holy|
                                        |of holies </char>to <char style="it">of the holies </char>(9:8); <char style="it">the holies </char>(9:12,25);|
                                        |and simply <char style="it">holies </char>(9:24). So the phrase <char style="it">of the holies </char>which|
                                        |appears in 10:19 is yet another usage of a shortened form of Holy of Holies, a repetition of the wording|
                                        |which appeared in 9:8 when you get right down to it.|

                                        |praise</char>. This is a metaphor which compares praise offered to God to OT sacrifices offered to God|
                                        |and incinerated on the altar of burnt offerings. Some have misinterpreted this to mean that it is a personal|
                                        |sacrifice on our part to praise God.|

 +PN V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To the blood-descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel who are among the Diaspora (i.e. the scattering|
     v 1                                |of Jews all over the world):|
 +P  V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |I’m delighted to write to you:|
 +   V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Consider it a joy, my dear comrades, when you by chance fall into various tests and trials which find|
     v 2                                |out what you’re made of, |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |knowing that the process of proving your faith produces perseverance. |
     V 4              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Let perseverance have the opportunity to become a mature, completed work, in order that you would become|
     v 4                                |mature and that every part of you would become complete with nothing left out.|
 +   V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But speaking of things which are left out…If someone is lacking in wisdom, advise him to simply ask for|
     v 5                                |wisdom from the giving-God who’ll grant the request without chewing the person out or demeaning him,|
     v 5                                |and it will be given to him. |
     V 6              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But admonish him to ask in faith, nothing about him wavering in doubt: you see, a person who doubts is|
     v 6                                |like the way that ocean waves are moved and tossed about by the wind. |
     V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |To this point, you should adjust that person’s expectations so that he does not expect to receive anything|
     v 7                                |from the Lord, |
     V 8              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |since he is a double-minded man, irresolute in all his ways.|
 +   V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Get the Humiliated, Abased Person to glory and take pride in his exaltation, |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and likewise get the rich man to practice humility and self-abasement, because, like the wild flowers|
     v10                                |of the field which reach an apex when they blossom and then fade back into obscurity, he too will have|
     v10                                |his moment in the sun then pass away and fade back into obscurity. |
     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, the sun rose and dried out the wild flower with its sweltering heat, its flower-part fell off,|
     v11                                |and the lovely appearance it projected was destroyed—this is the same way that the rich man will waste|
     v11                                |away in his journey through life.|
 +   V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Blessed is the man who perseveres over the course of tests and trials, since, after he’s attained approval|
     v12                                |because of his perseverance, he’ll receive the trophy of a deeply satisfying life, which is promised|
     v12                                |to those who love Him. |
     V13              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Teach the person who’s being tested by some sort of trial or temptation not to say, “I’m being tested|
     v13                                |by God to see if there’s any evil in me.” You see, God is un-tempt-able by any evil; He tempts no one.|
     V14              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Each person is tempted when he’s lured and dragged off by the passions which are peculiar to him and|
     v14                                |not necessarily to the next person. |
     V15              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Then once passion or desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. When it’s finished running its course,|
     v15                                |sin produces death (i.e., stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction).|
 +   V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Don’t get led down the primrose path, my dear comrades. |
     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Every good gift and every perfect present is from the sky above, coming down from the Creator of Astronomical|
     v17                                |Objects (i.e. the sun, the moon, stars, etc.), with whom there is no deviation in the movement of such|
     v17                                |objects and no hint or suggestion of change to them. |
     V18              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Having planned and decided to do so, he birthed us in a conceptualization of truth with the end-goal|
     v18                                |of us being the crème de la crème of His creation.|
 +   V19              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Be sure you get this down pat, my dear comrades: Each person should see to it that he’s quick to listen,|
     v19                                |slow to speak, slow to anger. |
     V20              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, a man’s anger won’t live up to God’s standards of right and wrong. |
     V21              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |In light of this, once you’ve rid yourself of any filthy residue of malice, with a soft-spoken, gentle|
     v21                                |self-restraint take to heart and fully embrace the implanted word of God which is able to relieve, rescue,|
     v21                                |and preserve your mind and emotions.|
 +   V22              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But become practitioners of a given subject matter and not just students who hear it taught, deceiving|
     v22                                |themselves because they listen but won’t do, |
     V23              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |because if somebody hears a subject lectured to him but doesn’t put it into practice, that guy’s like|
     v23                                |a man who looks at himself in a mirror and gets an idea of what he looks like— |
     V24              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |you see, he got an idea of what he looks likes, walked away, and immediately forgot what he looks like.|
     V25              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |But the fellow who crouched down and looked carefully at a perfect code, a freedom code, and stays put|
     v25                                |looking at it and didn’t become a forgetting-student but became a doing-practitioner, that fellow will|
     v25                                |be blessed in his doing.|
 +   V26              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |If anyone thinks that he strictly adheres to the do’s and don’ts of his religion and isn’t reigning in|
     v26                                |his tongue but instead kids himself into believing he follows his religion strictly—this sort of religion|
     v26                                |is worthless. |
     V27              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |A pure set of religious do’s and don’ts—a set that’s untainted from the Father-God’s point of view—is|
     v27                                |to visit orphans and widows in dire need for the purpose of helping them, while keeping oneself unstained|
     v27                                |from the world, i.e. the established order of humanity which wants nothing to do with God.|

                                        |tribes</char>. The phrase twelve tribes is a metonymy for all Israelites. By specifying the twelve tribes,|
                                        |James makes the distinction between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers. Since James’s authority|
                                        |is over the church in Jerusalem, and perhaps all of Israel, he extends his pastoral care to all believing|
                                        |Israelites who for one reason or another are located outside of Israel but nevertheless are Jewish like|
                                        |those living in Israel. At the time this epistle was written, there were more Jews outside of Israel|
                                        |than there were in Israel. But the schism in the early church between the Jewish and the non-Jewish believers|
                                        |would naturally cause the Jewish believers living outside of Israel to gravitate towards and affiliate|
                                        |with James.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">advise him to</char>…<char style="it">admonish him to</char>…<char style="it">adjust</char>…<char|

                                        |<char style="it">let</char>] <char style="it">him</char>. James uses this third-person imperative form|
                                        |of the Gk. verb in a parallel fashion as a figure of speech.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">likewise get the rich man to practice humility and self-abasement</char>…Lit: <char|
                                        |style="it">the rich man in his humiliation</char>. (The interpolations are justified by the parallel|
                                        |construction.) Before making generalizations about the wealthy based on this verse, one should first|
                                        |read James 2:6–7; 5:1–6 and understand that the “rich man” of that passage is the same “rich man” in|
                                        |v. 10,11 here. Though there’s a tendency for wealthy people to be abusive, not all of them are. But all|
                                        |of them are reminded to stay humble.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">wild flowers of the field</char>…Lit: <char style="it">grass</char>. Max and Mary claim|
                                        |that in this context this refers to wild flowers and not grass and that this is a picture of fragility|
                                        |from the OT (ref. Is. 40:6; Ps. 103:15|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">trophy of a deeply satisfying </char>life…Lit: <char style="it">crown</char> [<char|
                                        |style="it">victor’s wreath</char>] <char style="it">of life</char>. This is a metaphor where obtaining|
                                        |a deeply satisfying life by persevering through trials is compared to a victor being awarded the victor’s|
                                        |wreath. The word <char style="it">life</char> leans on the definition Jesus put forth in John 6:53, “if|
                                        |you won’t eat the Man’s flesh and drink his blood, you don’t have life within you.” In the next verse|
                                        |Jesus goes on to talk about eternal life, which is that special fullness of life that God gives. By this|
                                        |reasoning, the word <char style="it">life </char>in v. 12 here does not refer to physical existence but|
                                        |rather is the same concept of life and eternal life which Jesus taught. What James is saying is that|
                                        |perseverance through trials and temptations results in a deep richness to one’s life.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">conceived</char>…Same word used in Luke 1:24 when Elizabeth managed to become pregnant,|
                                        |insinuating a bit that this was only achieved after some difficulty. A few words later in this verse,|
                                        |James says <char style="it">gives birth to sin</char>, where the word <char style="it">give birth </char>is|
                                        |just that—a woman giving birth.<char style="it"> </char>This verse is a metaphor where temptation is|
                                        |compared to a man who impregnates a woman (i.e. a person) and she conceives a child sin and gives birth|
                                        |to it.|

                                        |1:16 in the LXX, “And God made the two great lights…”; therefore, the “lights” James refers to are the|
                                        |sun, the moon, and every other celestial object which emits light. The word <char style="it">shadow </char>used|
                                        |in this verse is similar in meaning to the way it’s used in Heb. 10:1; i.e., it’s not a physical shadow|
                                        |but rather an imperfect representation of another object. The Gk. words for<char style="it"> variation|
                                        |</char>and <char style="it">changing </char>are astronomical terms. In addition, it’s been known since|

                                        |theory held by the writers of the NT is that a person’s carnal nature is a part of their body (Rom. 7:18,23).|

                                        |of His people. James combines with this the OT concept of God dwelling among Israel. Like the other theories,|
                                        |there are contradictions to this one. Keep in mind that James is not writing a science textbook.|

                                        |There are multiple words in the NT which essentially mean <char style="it">to order, to give a command,|
                                        |</char>etc. The stem from which the word <char style="it">arrange </char>comes means to given an order,|
                                        |and it was a military term used when a commander issued orders to deploy units of phalanxes, etc. on|
                                        |a battlefield. A good arrangement of the units, and one which was carried out successfully, was crucial|
                                        |to victory on the battlefield. So <char style="it">hupotassō</char> means to allow oneself to be “arranged”|
                                        |by the person in command, knowing that the one in command has the overall view of what needs to be put|

                                        |familiar with. This shade of meaning to the word <char style="it">submit </char>differs from a shade|

                                        |which corresponds <char style="it">to obey</char>, literally means <char style="it">under the giving-ear-to.|
                                        |</char>This refers to being under the audible sound—the voice commands—of another person. The nature|
                                        |of the word is that one person is to simply obey the spoken-orders (and this would apply to any order,|
                                        |not just a spoken one) of the one above him. The emphasis is on simple obedience to the order, without|
                                        |questions asked and without an expectation that the one obeying will understand the big-picture. And|
                                        |this is where submit and obey diverge. The one who submits understands that his submission is necessary|
                                        |to accomplish the overall goal; that he should understand the overall goal and understand that he is|

                                        |Therefore, a child or a slave is expected to obey, not submit, but an adult, one who has heavy responsibilities,|

     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Throughout history, there have been two methods whereby the common soldier takes orders from a superior:|
                                        |the soldier can submit or he can obey. Generally speaking, armies where the soldiers submit are more|
                                        |effective than armies where the soldiers obey. Those who submit are encouraged to think beyond their|
                                        |individual contribution, and because of that, a person who submits may at times improvise according to|

                                        |plan. Soldiers who simply obey will fear potential retribution due to improvisation and not exploit opportunities|

                                        |</char>refers to pouring oil over someone (ex: John 11:2). Throughout the Bible, anointing a person marks|
                                        |that person with extraordinary abilities, abilities which originate from God and are actuated by means|
                                        |of the Holy Spirit (are a manifestation of the Holy Spirit). These special abilities are specific to|
                                        |that one person and are for a particular purpose. In this context of 1 John 2, John’s usage of the word|
                                        |<char style="it">anointing </char>is an extraordinary ability bestowed on each believer, but like any|
                                        |anointing, the extraordinary ability is unique to that person; no other person receives the same anointing.|
                                        |The 1 John 2 anointing is the ability to understand how exactly one should conduct himself in a godly|
                                        |manner on a day-to-day basis. The 1 John 2 anointing gives a person the ability to discern for himself|
                                        |what the correct thing is for him to do in life. Incidentally, this passage here refutes the notion that|
                                        |any church leader (especially a cult leader) should be deciding what an individual church member should|
                                        |do in their circumstances of life, especially to a fine detail.|

 +   V 1              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Beloved, don’t believe in every spirit, but instead examine the spirits to see if they are from God and|
     v 1                                |accept or reject them accordingly, because many false prophets have ventured out into the world, the|
     v 1                                |established order of humans. |
     V 2              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You’ll know if you’re dealing with the Spirit of God or not by this: all spirits who confess that Jesus|
     v 2                                |Christ has come to the earth in actual flesh and blood are from God, |
     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |and all spirits not confessing Jesus Christ and his having come in the flesh are not from God. And this|
     v 3                                |is the spirit of the archetypical antichrist, that which you’ve heard is coming to the world, and by|
     v 3                                |this time is already in the world. |

     v 4                                |world. |
     V 5              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |They are from the world; for this reason they speak as belonging to the world, and the world listens|

     V 6              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You are from God. He who knows and understands God listens to portions of the things we say; said person|
     v 6                                |who is not from God won’t listen to any part of what we have to say. By this we know, understand, and|

 +   V 7              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Beloved, let us love one another, since the Christian love is from God, and all who love have been begotten|
     v 7                                |by and from God and know and understand God. |

     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |The Christian love is identified by this: not that we have arrived at the point where we love God, but|
     v10                                |that He loved us and sent His son as the means of appeasement where our sin is concerned. |
     V11              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Beloved, if God loved us in this manner, we too are obligated to ever love one another. |
     V12              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Nobody has reached the point where they’ve seen God entirely. If we were to love one another, God dwells|

 +P  V16              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |God is love, and the one dwelling in the Christian love dwells in God, and God dwells in him; |
     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |by this, the love has been brought to perfection among us. This is so that we would have confidence on|
     v17                                |judgment day, since just as That One is, we too are the same way in this world. |
     V18              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Fear is not in or by the love of God, but rather the perfected love of God expels fear, since fear involves|
     v18                                |punishment; and the one who fears has not reached a state of perfection in the love of God. |

     V 3              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |You see, I rejoiced tremendously with the coming of the comrades and in their giving an account of you,|
     v 3                                |an account which is truthful insofar as you conduct your lives in truth. |

                                        |that Ray Summers in his book <char style="it">Worthy Is the Lamb</char> claimed were grammatical mistakes.|
                                        |The verb <char style="it">stand </char>here is in the passive voice but most translations, such as the|
                                        |NASB, translate it as active. The word <char style="it">give </char>in v. 3 translated <char style="it">offer|
                                        |up</char> is future tense but should be subjunctive. The words <char style="it">the prayers </char>is|
                                        |in the dative case, which is unexpected. In v. 5 the verb <char style="it">to take </char>is in the perfect|
                                        |tense, but is used like it’s aorist. Some observations on the claim that these are grammatical errors.|
                                        |First, looking at John’s contributions to the NT as a whole and not just at Revelation individually,|
                                        |Revelation is the only book with these kinds of errors. In the grammatical incidences enumerated from|
                                        |this passage, it’s hard to imagine that these would not have been mistakes caused by ignorance of the|
                                        |language. Now, grammatical mistakes are made when someone’s careless, perhaps writing while he’s tired|
                                        |or writing in too much of a hurry. And that may be the case. But inspecting a couple of the verb forms|
                                        |which are listed here, the passive form of <char style="it">to stand </char>and the perfect form of <char|
                                        |style="it">to take </char>are less common than the expected forms. Someone who’s sloppy, careless, or|
                                        |rushed would use the more common forms instead of the less common. So what’s the conclusion? Perhaps|
                                        |John couldn’t remember some of the forms of words and knew that the reader would be able to figure it|
                                        |out. Or he understood what he was writing and deliberately chose to write it and these are not mistakes.|
                                        |This leaves a translator with the task of figuring out what he meant on a case-by-case basis.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">very</char> <char style="it">high up in the sky</char>…Lit: <char style="it">mid-heaven</char>.|
                                        |In NT times, the sky and heaven as we know it were conflated into one, and there were multiple layers|
                                        |(many say there were seven). Progressing through these layers, one goes from the atmosphere surrounding|
                                        |us; to very high up in the sky; to where the sun and the stars are; then from there into the various|
                                        |layers of heaven, which presumably include paradise and the throne of God. According to such a gradation|
                                        |scheme, mid-heaven would be half-way through, and therefore very high up in the sky, perhaps even in|
                                        |their minds near where the stars are. Seeing that v. 13 mentions a vulture (or perhaps an eagle), vultures|
                                        |(and eagles for that matter) have been known to fly as high as 37,000 feet/11,275 meters). |
