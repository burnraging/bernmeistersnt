  <chapter number="1" style="c" sid="LUK 1" />
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="LUK 1:1" />In light of the fact that many have attempted to compose a narrative concerning the deeds which have
        been carried out to fulfillment among us, <verse eid="LUK 1:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="LUK 1:2" />and to record it in the same way that they—those from the get-go who became eye-witnesses and custodians
        of the entire affair—delivered and entrusted it to us, <verse eid="LUK 1:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="LUK 1:3" />it seemed like a good idea for me to follow up after them and write something for you, something that
        starts from the very beginning and which is completely accurate and in sequential order, Lord Theophilus,<verse eid="LUK 1:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="LUK 1:4" />so that you would become thoroughly acquainted with the affairs which you’ve learned by word of mouth,
        and that you would know them with certainty.<verse eid="LUK 1:4" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="LUK 1:5" />It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of the Jews, that there was a certain priest named Zechariah,
        from the Order of Abijah, and he had a wife who was of the priestly caste—and her name was Elizabeth.<verse eid="LUK 1:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="LUK 1:6" />Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, their conduct, from God’s perspective, was that they
        complied with all the commandments and expectations of correct behavior. <verse eid="LUK 1:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="LUK 1:7" />They had no children, because Elizabeth couldn’t have any children, and both were now elderly.<verse eid="LUK 1:7" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="LUK 1:8" />Now during his priestly order’s timeslot in the rotation schedule, he happened to be the one performing
        the priestly duties in the holy presence of God <verse eid="LUK 1:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="LUK 1:9" />(the appointment being determined according to the priests’ tradition of rolling dice), having entered
        into the temple sanctuary itself to light the incense; <verse eid="LUK 1:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="LUK 1:10" />and everyone who was in the multitude, a multitude of the folk-people, was outside praying during the
        hour of the incense lighting ritual. <verse eid="LUK 1:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="LUK 1:11" />So now, an angel sent from the Lord appeared to him standing to the right of the Altar of Incense. <verse eid="LUK 1:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="LUK 1:12" />Looking at the angel, Zechariah became disturbed, and fear fell upon him. <verse eid="LUK 1:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="LUK 1:13" />The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah; you see, your prayer has been taken to heart, and
        your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you’ll name him John. <verse eid="LUK 1:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="LUK 1:14" />He’ll be a cause of joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice at his birth. <verse eid="LUK 1:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="LUK 1:15" />Indeed, he’ll be used mightily by the Lord and won’t drink wine or liquor—absolutely won’t—and he’ll
        be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb, <verse eid="LUK 1:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="LUK 1:16" />and many native Israelites will heed the Lord their God. <verse eid="LUK 1:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="LUK 1:17" />The Lord will use him as a herald in a spirit and power the likeness of which Elijah had, to soften the
        hearts of the fathers towards the children, and the skeptics and the disobedient to the sensibility of
        the ways of the righteous, to bring about a fully-refined people for the Lord.” <verse eid="LUK 1:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="LUK 1:18" />Zechariah said to the angel, “Just how will the realization of these things come to me? The fact is,
        I’m old, and my wife is well-past her prime.” <verse eid="LUK 1:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="LUK 1:19" />The angel replied, “I am the high-ranking angel Gabriel: the one who stands in the presence of God. Concerning
        these things, He sent me to speak to you and deliver the good news. <verse eid="LUK 1:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="LUK 1:20" />See here now—you will remain silent, unable to speak, until the time comes that these things come to
        pass, as a consequence of you not having believed my words, which will be fulfilled in the course of
        good time.”<verse eid="LUK 1:20" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="LUK 1:21" />The people were expecting Zechariah to have come out already and were baffled at how long a time he was
        spending in the temple. <verse eid="LUK 1:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="LUK 1:22" />When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he’d seen a vision while inside
        the temple. He was gesturing to them, all the while remaining mute. <verse eid="LUK 1:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="LUK 1:23" />When his order’s timeslot for priestly service was up, he left to go back home. <verse eid="LUK 1:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="LUK 1:24" />Some time afterwards, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and during the five months that she was keeping herself
        in seclusion, she kept on saying, <verse eid="LUK 1:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="LUK 1:25" />”All this because the Lord wanted things to turn out for me in a way that would remove my shame in the
        eyes of others.”<verse eid="LUK 1:25" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="LUK 1:26" />Now in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to a city in Galilee called
        Nazareth, <verse eid="LUK 1:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="LUK 1:27" />to a young, never-married woman engaged to a man named Joseph, who was a direct descendant of David—and
        the name of this young woman was Mary. <verse eid="LUK 1:27" />
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="LUK 1:28" />He entered the physical world right in front of her and said, </para>
    <para style="p" vid="LUK 1:28">“Greetings, favored-one, the Lord be with you.” <verse eid="LUK 1:28"/>
      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="LUK 1:29" />Now she was deeply disturbed at the remark and was trying to figure out what the nature of the visit
        would be. <verse eid="LUK 1:29" />
      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="LUK 1:30" />The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary; the fact is, you’ve found favor with God. <verse eid="LUK 1:30" />
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="LUK 1:31" />See here now—you’ll conceive and give birth to a son, and you’ll name him ‘Jesus.’ <verse eid="LUK 1:31" />
      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="LUK 1:32" />He’ll be capable, noteworthy, and accomplished and will be called a son of the Most High. The Lord God
        will give him the throne of his ancestor David, <verse eid="LUK 1:32" />
      <verse number="33" style="v" sid="LUK 1:33" />and he’ll reign forever over the Israeli people, and his kingdom will never come to an end.” <verse eid="LUK 1:33" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="34" style="v" sid="LUK 1:34" />Mary said to the angel, “How will this come about, since I don’t have a husband with whom to be intimate?”<verse eid="LUK 1:34" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="35" style="v" sid="LUK 1:35" />The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the miraculous power of the Most High will
        engulf you. For this reason, the one you’re giving birth to is holy, and he’ll be called a son of God.<verse eid="LUK 1:35" />
      <verse number="36" style="v" sid="LUK 1:36" />Take a look—in her old age, your relative Elizabeth—even she—is pregnant with a son; the one everyone
        took for granted was infertile—this is her sixth month of pregnancy. <verse eid="LUK 1:36" />
      <verse number="37" style="v" sid="LUK 1:37" />You see, with God, all things are possible.”<verse eid="LUK 1:37" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="38" style="v" sid="LUK 1:38" />Mary said, “I present myself as the servant of the Lord. Let things come to pass with regard to me according
        to your word.” And the angel departed from her.<verse eid="LUK 1:38" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="39" style="v" sid="LUK 1:39" />During this time, Mary took a trip into the hill country, to a town in Judea. <verse eid="LUK 1:39" />
      <verse number="40" style="v" sid="LUK 1:40" />She entered Zechariah’s house and was welcomed enthusiastically by Elizabeth. <verse eid="LUK 1:40" />
      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="LUK 1:41" />It so happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; Elizabeth was
        filled with the Holy Spirit, <verse eid="LUK 1:41" />
      <verse number="42" style="v" sid="LUK 1:42" />and with a great cry uttered back, “You in particular among women be blessed, (that is, the recipient
        of good things); and blessed be, (that is, let the pronouncement of goodness be over), the produce of
        your womb. <verse eid="LUK 1:42" />
      <verse number="43" style="v" sid="LUK 1:43" />How did I get such an honor, that the mother of my Lord would come to visit me? <verse eid="LUK 1:43" />
      <verse number="44" style="v" sid="LUK 1:44" />In fact—get this—the moment the sound of your greeting entered my ear, the baby I’m carrying leaped in
        exultation. <verse eid="LUK 1:44" />
      <verse number="45" style="v" sid="LUK 1:45" />She who believed is blessed, because it will be a realization of those things which have been spoken
        to her and established from the Lord.”<verse eid="LUK 1:45" />
