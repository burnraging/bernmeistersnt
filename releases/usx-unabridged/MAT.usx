  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="ipi">According to church history, Matthew was the first of the four gospels to be written. Apparently, it
    was commissioned by the Jewish church, those Jews who came to believe in Jesus as the Messiah and continued
    to hold to their Jewish ways. For this reason it is steeped in Judaism and assumes the reader is familiar
    with the Judaism of the Old Testament.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Matthew, one of the twelve apostles, was a logical choice to write this book since he was an eyewitness
    to most of Jesus’s ministry, which is the majority of the book. It’s assumed that the parts in which
    he wasn’t an eye-witness, he interviewed those who lived in Israel who were themselves eyewitnesses of
    John’s ministry, etc.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Church history also says that Matthew was originally written in Hebrew then translated into Gk. The GT
    has a simplistic and awkward feeling, the same sort you get when you follow subtitles of a foreign movie.
    It is apparent in the GT that Matthew was not a native Greek speaker. He does not have the command of
    the language which Paul and Luke have. But one thing is clear: an extensive amount of research went into
    the Gospel of Matthew.</para>
  <para style="ipi">But Matthew is rich in figures of speech, rich in symbolism, and has a Semitic feel to it. This gives
    it a uniqueness among the NT books. The figures of speech have a richness which is difficult to follow
    for those not intimately familiar with the Bible and those who can’t see the figures of speech beneath
    the literal words. The more literal translations, the KJV in particular, preserve the colorful language
    at the expense of being more difficult to comprehend. In order to make it more comprehensible, much of
    the rich language has to be abandoned, which is a pity. To complicate matters, Matthew quotes Jesus saying
    things that cause one to stop and scratch his head for a while.</para>
  <para style="ipi">So that these treasures of literature don’t completely fall through the cracks of translation, copious
    footnotes supplement the rendered text to point to the original, beautiful language. In addition, because
    Matthew is such a lively book, it merits a more lively translation. If one looks through all the layers
    of translations, simplicity of language, myriads of OT references, one sees that Jesus was a colorful
    speaker, much like those simple ministers who can break a congregation out into laughter and a moment
    later bring them to tears. Of interest, also, is that there are a couple of parables which are told like
    an ordinary story, no surprises. An interesting story, but one which, part way through, ceases to be
    an ordinary story and goes off the rail into something bizarre. Examples are the parable of the wheat
    and the tares (Math. 13), parable of the vineyard day-laborers (Matt. 20). </para>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">Ramah…Rachel…</char>The place <char style="it">Ramah </char>and the name <char style="it">Rachel
        </char>are metonymies . Ramah is a suburb of Jerusalem to the north, so Ramah is a metonymy of the greater
        metropolitan area of Jerusalem extending out to remote suburbs. Remote, because Bethlehem is a suburb
        south of Jerusalem, whereas Ramah is a suburb to the north, making their distance even greater. Rachel
        is an ancestor of the Benjamites who lived there. Hence Rachel, assumed to be a common woman’s name,
        is a metonymy for the typical, child-bearing woman who lives in Jerusalem and in its far-reaching suburbs.
        As such she personifies the suffering of the average woman who lived anywhere near Jerusalem and who
        had infants at that time. To put these metonymies in terms that the contemporary generation understands,
        the name <char style="it">Rachel</char> is a meme like the name <char style="it">Karen </char>is a meme
        for the Gen-Z’ers. To be clear, Rachel is not a Karen—i.e. both are memes but characterize entirely different
        types of women. Since <char style="it">Ramah </char>is so far from Bethlehem, it can be viewed as a metonymy
        similar to the metonymy <char style="it">Timbuktu</char>. </char>

        gives the interested party a broader understanding of what Jesus had in mind when he spoke those words.
        In any event, meekness can be described as the absence of the pushiness, the obnoxious attitudes, the
        belligerency, the quickness to retaliate, the harsh words and sharpness of tongue, the carnal loudness,
        the eagerness to step on others in order to promote self, etc. In the absence of these emerges that gentle

        (י‎), which is a small letter resembling a backwards apostrophe, much smaller than any of the other letters
        of the Hebrew alphabet. The Gk. word <char style="it">little-horn </char>is derived from the Gk. word
        for <char style="it">horn</char>, perhaps a diminutive. When applied to the alphabet, the closest English
        equivalent is <char style="it">serif</char>, but that doesn’t do the word justice, as there are several
        sets of letters in the Hebrew alphabet which are indistinguishable except for a short stroke of the pen,
        a small protrusion—a little horn. Here’s some pairs of Hebrew letters which are only distinguished by
        a short stroke of the pen: gimel and nun (ג vs. נ‎); bet and kaph (ב vs. כ‎); dalet and rhesh (ד vs.
        ר). There are other pairs. So Jesus is saying that there’ll be no small stroke of the pen which will
        delete the letter yod or swap a letter for its similar-looking twin. Since written Hebrew doesn’t normally
        use vowels, the changing of a single letter could more easily change an entire word than a single change
        of a letter in English could. And, of course, a change in word could change the meaning of a verse entirely.
        So Jesus is saying there’ll be no small stroke of the pen changes to the Law which would result in profound
        changes to the meaning of a verse in the Law.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">the required divorce certificate…</char>Under OT Law/the Law of Moses, as quoted here,
        divorce was permitted. By law, the husband could (but the wife could not) initiate the legal proceedings
        for the divorce and, if approved, was required to supply her with a divorce certificate to protect her
        reputation, her legal, and her moral standing. In this day and age, the laws for divorce are applied
        equally to husbands and wives, therefore Jesus’s commandment applies equally to both sexes as well. So
        in v. 32, which reads, <char style="it">divorcing your wife for any reason except in the case of sexual
        immorality makes her commit adultery, and whosoever remarries after having divorced is an adulterer</char>,
        the case of the husband is treated differently than the case of the wife, as the husband was permitted
        by law to initiate a marriage and to initiate a divorce. The wife could only ascent to it or acquiesce
        to it. Therefore, their situations are different, and Jesus speaks to both separately. In modern times,
        we would simply say, <char style="it">whoever gets a divorce and remarries (except in the case of sexual
        immorality) commits adultery</char>.</char>

        <char style="it">(i.e., don’t change the way you treat them and seek retaliation)…</char>”An eye for
        an eye and a tooth for a tooth” was OT law; the same was also embedded in Hammurabi’s law code. If someone
        wrongs you, you have the legal right of retaliation, the right to get even. For mankind, this is natural
        law; “turning the other cheek” is therefore a point of contention for many. A couple things to consider.
        First, the point Jesus was making is that you don’t have to retaliate when you’re wronged. He didn’t
        mean that you shouldn’t protect yourself against those who try to harm you. Second, read Acts 23:1-10,
        where Paul was actually slapped on the cheek, and ask yourself, “Did Paul turn the other cheek?” Same
        thing for Acts 16:37: when Paul, a Roman citizen, had been illegally beaten, he demanded his rights.
        Also see Acts 22:25.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">Turning the other cheek is to present the same “face”—the same disposition—which you presented previously.
        Don’t change your disposition based on the way people treat you. For example, an employee is working
        at a retailer. While the employee is politely explaining a company policy, the customer behaves rudely.
        The employee turns the cheek when he continues to show politeness after the customer behaves badly. An
        example of turning the other cheek is when Joseph decided to divorce Mary (Matt. 1:19): he chose to do
        it quietly rather than to retaliate by making a stink about it.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">Turning the other cheek is not as extreme and uncommon as it appears. In fact, even non-Christians turn
        the other cheek from time to time. Waitresses who are treated rudely by their customers but continue
        to be polite to them are turning the other cheek.</char>

        promulgated by Jesus himself. Some confusion arises if we simply take the phrase at face-value instead
        of taking it as an idiom. The face-value meaning steers us in the direction of a person either becoming
        a Christian or not; either gaining access to heaven in the afterlife or not; etc. The meaning of this
        idiom is understood by studying the usages in the NT, since it is used copiously. One example is Acts
        14:22, …<char style="it">succeed in their life of faith (enter God’s kingdom)</char>. Notice how Acts
        14:22 is encouraging those who are already believers to enter the kingdom of God.</char>

        <char style="w" strong="G01967">ἐπιούσιος</char>) only appears in the NT here and in Luke 11:3. According
        to Origen, this word was coined by Matthew and Luke; tradition maintains that it means “necessary for
        existence.” The root <char style="it">ousia</char> <char style="w" strong="G03776">οὐσία</char>) means
        “substance, state, condition, being, essence”; although the prefix <char style="it">epi</char> <char
        style="w" strong="G01909">ἐπί</char>) can mean several things, it’s assumed to mean “at” in this word.
        (Gk. prefixes do not always modify the meaning of the root word in a predictable way.) But it’s entirely
        plausible that <char style="it">at-existence </char>is more precisely rendered <char style="it">sustenance,
        </char>which is the meaning of <char style="it">epiousios </char>passed down by tradition. <char style="it">Bread
        </char>is a synecdoche for food in general, as, up until the last century or so, the majority of caloric

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">the eye (what a person is fixated on) is the body’s source of light (its guidance system),
        it’s lamp…</char>In ancient Israel, in the average home there was a single room where the inhabitants
        gathered when it got too dark to see. In that room, they illuminated a single lamp or candle and placed
        it on a lampstand in a central location, where it effectively filled the entire house with light. In
        addition, in the Bible the eye symbolizes one’s fascinations, desires, meditations, fixations, thoughts,
        etc. In English, we speak symbolically too, in statements like, “I’ve got my eye on that new Escalade®.”
        Furthermore, in the NT, the body refers to not just the physical body but can also refer to the physical
        appetites and the physical actions we take. Together, these explain what Jesus meant in this passage.
        Also, ref. John 11:9,10.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">draw conclusions about people so as to write them off…</char>Lit: <char style="it">don’t
        judge</char>. (Also, ref. note of Luke 6:37.) The word <char style="it">judge </char>as used in the Bible
        means one of the following: ascertaining guilt or innocence, in or out of an actual courtroom; the verdict
        reached from such deliberation; the resulting sentence; a combination of these. This is evident upon
        examining how the word is used in both the OT and NT. In the case of 7:1 here, judging refers to the
        verdict reached from deliberation but does not refer to the ascertaining of guilt or innocence; hence,
        the misunderstanding of what Jesus is saying here. Many who read “don’t judge” here in 7:1 understand
        it to mean that Christians should refrain from ascertaining guilt or innocence, i.e. they shouldn’t decide
        whether another person’s deeds are moral or immoral, and to make such decisions brings judgment upon
        ourselves. Not only does this contradict common sense but it’s not consistent with other teaching of
        the NT. It’s the case of building a doctrine on one verse of Scripture and not taking all of Scripture
        into consideration. Those who wrote the NT lived in the times of Jesus and were either spent much time
        around him (and conversed in the same native language), were taught directly by him, or had contact with
        those who did. Had Jesus meant that Christians shouldn’t ascertain moral guilt or innocence of others,
        then their writers would reflect that. But their writings do not. In other words, Paul’s epistles violate
        the notion that “don’t judge” means one shouldn’t look at another Christian and decide if what they’re
        doing is right or wrong. For example, Paul wrote these statements in 1 Cor. 5, <char style="it">For I
        verily as absent in body but present in spirit, hath judged already, as though I were present, concerning
        him that hath done this deed</char> (v. 3)…<char style="it">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company
        with fornicators </char>(v. 9)…<char style="it">But now I have written unto you not to keep company,
        if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard,
        or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat (v. 11)…For what have I to do to judge them also that
        are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? </char>(v. 12)…<char style="it">But them that are
        without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person </char>(v. 13). Paul
        also wrote <char style="it">reprove, rebuke, exhort </char>(2 Tim. 4:2). Paul rebuked Peter (Gal. 2:11–21).</char>

        designated as unclean by the Law of Moses. Verse 6 is telling us not to give what we treasure most to
        filthy, unworthy people. They’ll just have contempt for it, then, knowing you’ve entrusted them with

        here as though it originates from the same source, and, when you get right down to it, it is all really

        law of the land; by restrictions specified in the Bible; by godly rules of conduct; by accepted moral
        practices; by common decency. This covers a wide swath of peoples …pirates who sailed in hunt of prey…philosophers

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">the Man…</char>Lit: <char style="it">Son of Man. </char>This is a phrase that has its
        origins in the OT, particularly Ezekiel. The Bible embeds family members into phrases, like <char style="it">son
        of perdition</char>, <char style="it">father of lies</char>, <char style="it">call wisdom your sister</char>,
        etc. In the Bible the phrase <char style="it">son of</char> means someone who’s a perfect example, who
        faithfully personifies, or who’s the epitome or the total embodiment of a concept, ideal, or state of
        being. <char style="it">Son of man</char> means several things. It means the perfect man; one who has
        the full spectrum of human qualities alive and fully functioning in himself; a sort of Renaissance man;
        a single specimen who’s the most suitable representative for the human race; a person who stands in proxy
        for all human beings; a person of character and ability; and in this context, the Man. All these describe
        Jesus.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">bury my father…</char>this<char style="it"> </char>is likely an expression and a hyperbole,
        and means that you have urgent business to attend to, but not to be taken literally that your father
        just died. (Some say it instead means that that your father is still alive and you have to wait for how
        many years for him to pass away.) After all, one of the Ten Commandments is to honor your mother and
        father, and Jesus would not tell the disciple to violate a commandment of that magnitude, and one is
        applicable in NT times as well. If <char style="it">bury my father </char>is an expression indeed, then
        Jesus’s reply <char style="it">Let the dead bury their own dead </char>is a play on that expression.
        The “dead” Jesus refers to are the spiritually dead; the expression therefore means, “Let the spiritually
        dead take care of their own pressing matters.”</char>

        Just as Jesus commands his disciples in this chapter to go about from place to place and to have their
        material needs met at the places they visited, those who itinerate in this manner—prophets in this case—are
        also expected to live off the generosity and patronage of those in the cities who welcomed them. The
        word <char style="it">receive </char>used here refers to those who take in and shelter such a prophet,
        provide him with meals while he’s stays with them, and clothe him, if necessary. These gifts of food,
        shelter, and clothing are the prophet’s “wages” referred to in this passage. What it means to receive
        a prophet in the name of a prophet is to welcome and support that prophet simply out of respect for his
        calling and his ministry and not because of his charisma, his personality, a personal like or dislike
        of the prophet himself, or other such reasons. Those who provide this sustenance will themselves receive
        back a “prophet’s wage”: a payback blessing from God in the form of material goods in this lifetime and,
        in addition, of spiritual rewards in the life to come. </char>

        groups and, as time passes, grow bored and restless and want to play a game of some sort to entertain
        themselves and pass the time. The more children who play, the more fun the game, so the first group of
        children tries to recruit the second in their frivolities. But the second group is not interested in
        playing. The first group, desperate to break the monotony, seeks to entice the second group with something—anything—which
        appeals to them, so long as they’ll get up and start to play with them. They attempt two opposite games
        that appeal to two opposite moods, figuring that one of them will be appealing to the second group.</char>

        after the second refused all their attempts to get up and play with them. Both of the games were emotional
        and exhilarating. The first game was a dance: someone would play the flute and everybody would dance.
        The second game was a sad song: someone would sing a dirge and everybody would pretend that they’re at
        a funeral. At first, this seems to be an unusual game to play, one that would be no fun at all. This
        is not the case; extreme emotions are entertaining regardless how morbid they may be. This is the same
        reason why teens like horror movies and zombie apocalypse movies, or movies with a lot of bloodshed.
        They cover their eyes during the gory scenes, but peak a bit. By the same measure, sad movies and sad
        songs—though not as popular as they used to be—are also entertaining. Years ago, teenage girls used to
        bring a box of tissues with them for when they cried through a sad movie. </char>

        but when that man resists it or when it’s cast out of him. He travels over “uninhabitable, inhospitable
        landscape.” This is not physical landscape but it’s a landscape of human beings. The demon is looking
        for another person to inhabit, which is what is meant in v. 43 by “seeking residency” (literally, <char
        style="it">rest</char>). To enter a person, he dangles a suggestion in front of them, and they must take
        it, then it must grow, then he eventually enters them. The uninhabitable, inhospitable landscape (literally,
        <char style="it">dry places</char>) consists of people who one by one reject the suggestions or subsequent
        advances of that demon. Having been rejected by others, in v. 44 the demon returns to his original host
        (literally, <char style="it">house</char>).</char>

        a Scribe, those who were the experts in the Old Testament, becomes a true believer, then he’s like the
        manager who runs a house, presumably a large one, presumably one where there’s much land, many workers,
        etc. In this case, there’s a lot of tools, machinery, storage containers, etc. that are buried in closets,
        warehouses, etc. The manager had been there for years and had known about every item which was made or
        purchased, what condition it’s in, and where it’s stored. So, for example, if on the farm they need to
        lift a heavy rock or something, he thinks for a while and then tells everyone, “There’s and old rope
        and pulley buried in the back of the basement closet. Someone go fetch it, and we’ll use that to lift
        the rock.” That analogy is applied to the Scribe. He had done all this study and learned the ins and
        outs of many verses of Scriptures, so when his heart turns to the Lord, he’s able to retrieve old pieces
        of understanding that he learned years before in the same way as the manager would get some old tool

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 14:2" />He said to all those around him, “This is John the Baptist. He’s been raised from the dead, and that
        explains how he <char style="it">can </char>work these miracles.” <verse eid="MAT 14:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="MAT 14:3" />You see, on account of Herodias, his brother Phillip’s wife, Herod arrested John, bound him, and put
        him away in jail. <verse eid="MAT 14:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="MAT 14:4" />This was because John kept on telling him, “It’s not lawful for you to be married to her.” <verse eid="MAT 14:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="MAT 14:5" />Though wanting to kill him, he feared the masses, because they considered him to be a prophet. <verse eid="MAT 14:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="MAT 14:6" />On Herod’s birthday, Herodias’s daughter performed a dance in front of everyone, <verse eid="MAT 14:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="MAT 14:7" />resulting in him making an oath promising that he’d give her anything she asked for. <verse eid="MAT 14:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="MAT 14:8" />Her mother nudged her to say, “Give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter.” <verse eid="MAT 14:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAT 14:9" />The king became deeply upset because of the oath that he made in front of all his guests. He ordered
        that the request be granted, <verse eid="MAT 14:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAT 14:10" />and he sent for John to be beheaded in jail. <verse eid="MAT 14:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="MAT 14:11" />His head was brought on a platter and was given to the teenage girl, and she presented it to her mother.<verse eid="MAT 14:11" />

        what was needed or appropriate for that season. God was performing through Jesus mostly healing miracles,

        ministry were of a different nature than Elijah’s, but the Pharisees expected Jesus to vindicate himself
        through Elijah-type miracles. The Pharisees were demanding a miracle that was relevant to Elijah’s dispensation
        and would not recognize a miracle which was relevant to Jesus’s dispensation. They could look at the

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">how many basketfuls you picked up…</char>The account of the leftover baskets here in
        vv. 9, 10 is repeated Mark 9:17. The lesson is the same: in both miracles of multiplication, the disciples
        finished with the same number of baskets as when they started. For that matter, had they fed more, they
        still would have finished with the same number of baskets as they started. The food was not multiplied
        when Jesus gave thanks before the meal. Jesus did not pray and a heap of food appeared. Instead, the
        miracle occurred each time a disciple reached his hand into a basket to hand out more food. The food
        was multiplied on-the-spot over and over again, as many times as was needed. The point Jesus makes is
        that God’s provision for our daily bread happens on-the-spot, right when it’s needed, as many times as
        it’s needed, and not provided in a large lump beforehand. Jesus is impressing on them the fact that if
        they were to need more food, it would appear the moment it was needed, and that they shouldn’t worry
        about it.</char>

        (πέτρα /Strong’s 4073)]<char style="it"> I will build my church</char>. Peter’s name means <char style="it">rock</char>
        and Jesus is making a word play here by both referring to Peter by his name and by reminding Peter that
        he is a rock. Some disagree as to the interpretation of this verse. Some point to Gk. lectionaries and
        say that petros is a different word than petra, that petros means a rock fragment, that while Peter is
        the rock fragment, Jesus himself is the petra. The other argument says that petros is the Gk. word petra
        converted into its name form. I should point out that this second argument is more plausible, for the
        reason that the attributive adjective construct of the word <char style="it">this</char> in the Gk.,
        namely <char style="it">tautay tay petra</char> or ταύτῃ τῇ πέτρᾳ, <char style="w" strong="G03778">ταύτῃ </char>),
        <char style="w" strong="G03588">τῇ </char>), <char style="w" strong="G04073">πέτρᾳ</char>) binds petros
        to its antecedent petra, and therefore they are one in the same. It’s worth pointing out that James supplanted
        Peter in the leadership of the Jewish church in the years following Pentecost.</char>

      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="MAT 17:1" />Six days later, Jesus went up a high mountain, bringing along with him Peter, James, and his brother
        John—those four alone. <verse eid="MAT 17:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 17:2" />He was metamorphosed in front of them, and his face shined like the sun, and his clothing became as bright
        as the full light of day. <verse eid="MAT 17:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="MAT 17:3" />And—like that—Moses and Elijah were seen talking with him. <verse eid="MAT 17:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="MAT 17:4" />Peter exclaimed to Jesus, “Lord, it’s a good thing we’re here. If you’d like, I’ll build three little
        holy edifices <char style="it">to house them</char><char style="sup">[a]</char> here, one for you, one
        for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <verse eid="MAT 17:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="MAT 17:5" />A cloud appeared abruptly while he was still in the middle of talking, engulfing them in its shadow,
        and just as abruptly a voice spoke from out of the cloud saying, “This here is my Beloved Son, in whom
        I’m quite pleased. Listen to him again and again.” <verse eid="MAT 17:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="MAT 17:6" />Once the disciples heard the voice, they fell flat on their faces and became really scared. <verse eid="MAT 17:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="MAT 17:7" />Jesus went to them, touched them, and said, <char style="wj">“Rise, and do not be afraid.” </char><verse eid="MAT 17:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="MAT 17:8" />When they opened their eyes, they didn’t see anything except for Jesus back to normal and by himself
        again.<verse eid="MAT 17:8" />

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAT 17:9" />While they were going down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <char style="wj">“Don’t tell anyone about

      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAT 17:10" />The disciples asked him, “So now, why do the designated teachers<char style="sup">[A]</char> say that
        Elijah must come first, <char style="it">before everything else happens</char>?” <verse eid="MAT 17:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="MAT 17:11" />He retorted, <char style="wj">“True, Elijah will come and set everything right again. </char><verse eid="MAT 17:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="MAT 17:12" /><char style="wj">But what I’m telling you is that Elijah has already come, and they didn’t acknowledge
        him </char><char style="it"><char style="wj">as being sent from God</char></char><char style="wj">, but
        instead did to him the extent of what</char><char style="it"><char style="wj"> their evil hearts</char></char><char

      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="MAT 17:13" />It was then that the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.<verse eid="MAT 17:13" />

      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="MAT 17:14" />When he got back to the crowd, a man came up to him kneeling in front of him <verse eid="MAT 17:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="MAT 17:15" />saying, “Sir, have pity on my son since he’s epileptic and suffers badly. You see, one moment he’s having
        a seizure and the next moment he’s back to normal again.<char style="sup">[c]</char> <verse eid="MAT 17:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="MAT 17:16" />I brought him to your disciples, and they weren’t able to cure him.” <verse eid="MAT 17:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="MAT 17:17" />Jesus, in his reaction, answered, <char style="wj">“Oh, the disbelief and perversion of this Zeitgeist</char><char

      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="MAT 17:18" />Jesus dropped the hammer on him, the demon came out of him, and the child was treated that moment. <verse eid="MAT 17:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="MAT 17:19" />While they were alone, his disciples came over to him and asked, “What’s the reason why we couldn’t cast
        it out on our own?” <verse eid="MAT 17:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="MAT 17:20" />Engaging them, he said, <char style="wj">“Because of your little-faith. I really mean it when I tell
        you that if you were to have mustard-seed-faith, you’d tell the mountain, ‘Pick yourself up from here
        and go over there,’ and it would go over there. Nothing would be impossible for you.” </char><verse eid="MAT 17:20" />

      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="MAT 17:25" />Peter took note of the comment and said “Ok” and went into the house. Anticipating him, Jesus said to

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">$10,000…</char>Lit: <char style="it">100 denarrii</char>, which is about 14 ounces (0.4Kg)
        of silver. Converting this to contemporary US dollar equivalency is not trivial, nor will all agree on
        the result, but nevertheless, an attempt is made. As it was in ancient times, so it was up until the
        last century or so, than coins were tethered to their intrinsic value in gold or silver. The average
        biblical commentator did simple conversions based on the value of silver. But this does not give meaningful
        results, as the leaps in industrial productivity have made silver relatively plentiful compared to ancient
        times. The cost of silver in today’s US dollars is around $0.76/gram—but that in no way reflects the
        purchasing power of silver today verses silver in ancient times. A more accurate method for conversion
        is to base it on the cost of unskilled labor. Even that varies enormously between industrialized nations
        and non-industrialized nations. The cost of labor in ancient times can be ascertained from Matt. 20:2,
        which is namely 1 denarius (4g silver) per day. In US in the 19<char style="sup">th</char> century, a
        day’s labor went for around $0.80, which was around 18g of silver, or 4.5 times more silver per day than
        what a worker in ancient times received—which demonstrates the inadequacy of simple conversions based
        on the price of gold or silver. But if one assumes that an unskilled worker makes $12/hour nowadays in
        industrialized nations, and therefore is paid $100 per day, then a denarius would represent $100 in today’s
        purchasing power. Of course, in contemporary, non-industrialized nations, the price of labor per day
        might be $5–$10, which is substantially less than industrialized nations. So the 100 denarrii equate
        to $10,000 of purchasing power in industrialized nations, but only $500 in non-industrialized nations.</char>

        the eye of a needle than for a rich man</char>…Many believe that the eye of a needle refers to a small
        gate, perhaps a yard (a meter) high, within a city wall gate which was used at night to let travelers
        enter a city without having to open the larger gate. A camel could barely fit through this smaller portal
        if it were to have all its baggage unpacked and it were to squeeze down and inch its way through. The
        analogy is that the camel, in addition to scrunching, has to unpack all its goods in order to enter in,
        just as Jesus asks the young man to give up all his belongings in order to enter the kingdom. But regardless
        of whether one receives this argument or not, a point to be made is that God is not opposed to the wealthy
        per se, but when the wealthy are made to choose between their earthly riches and the kingdom of God,
        it is only with great difficulty that they will part with their goods and choose the kingdom. God is
        not the one who prevents them from entering his kingdom; their own choice prevents them. Also, ref. Luke
        18:25.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">not dressed for a wedding…</char>Throughout the Bible, clothes are symbolic of righteousness,
        one’s standing before God. One who is clothed properly has right standing before God. This is what Jesus
        is referring to here. There is a righteousness that man attempts on his own and a righteousness which
        God provides. Man’s righteousness is his own clothing, and, in this parable, his own clothing is not
        the proper attire for a wedding. The only attire which is proper for a wedding is that which God provides,
        His wedding outfit. The bad folk in v.10 who were invited were given the proper clothing to wear, meaning
        that they received a righteousness given by God, and therefore were not thrown out of the wedding.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">There are many invited indeed, but few of them are selected</char>…Lit: <char style="it">many
        are the called, few are the chosen</char>. From the repetition of words in this passage, it’s clear that
        Jesus in this verse is referring to the ones who have been invited to the wedding. In other words, the
        <char style="it">the called </char>in v.14 here specifically refers to those invited in v.3. The chosen
        refers to those who in v.8 qualify (are worthy). Jesus is saying that many are invited to the wedding
        but only a few show up and are dressed properly when they do. In that light, God is not arbitrarily choosing
        a few out of the many, but lays down simple, easy requirements that only a few will comply with.</char>

        congregation, and do some research on what the abomination of desolation is, to refresh himself on Daniel’s
        prophecies, and complete this research before the reading. Then the deacon, when he reached this verse

        roofs as porches. What Jesus is saying is to take the quick way down off the roof of the house, which
        is the ladder on the outside of the house, rather than the slower way down, which is the stairs or ladders
        on the inside of the house, and while going through the house pick up some belongings. This is a figure
        of speech, akin to a hyperbole. In reality, those warned to flee would have two minutes or so—but only
        two minutes—to gather some belongings for the road, get the kids, unhitch the donkey, and get out of
        there. This is the point Jesus is making.</char>

        a pregnant woman to flee quickly and thereafter travel at a fast pace, since, obviously, pregnant women
        can’t march easily. Women with infants (breastfeeding women) will have difficulty because there’ll be
        a limited amount of food to eat compounded by the calories burned while travelling at a fast clip. Such
        women won’t be able to produce as much milk in these conditions. Furthermore, children who are still
        breastfeeding likely are still in diapers, and infants are more difficult to carry around on a backpack
        too, or the like. But it seems that Jesus is using examples of women in a figure of speech, to represent
        anyone who would have difficulty fleeing…the elderly, the bedridden, the lame, etc.</char>

        which consists of not only Saturdays but a myriad of Jewish holidays. Also, bear in mind that the Israeli
        growing season is in the winter, not in the summer. This begs the question, just why would flight in
        either the winter time or on Sabbaths and holidays be difficult? The likely answer is that during both
        of these times, there’s no previously stored food available which can be taken in a hurry for the trip
        to the mountains. While one must store away food in the off season to eat, when the crops are growing,
        you’ve already eaten through your cache. Likewise, with the Sabbaths the Jews did all their preparations
        for the Sabbath on the day before, and didn’t have any bread baked, etc. on the Sabbath day itself, so
        a there’d be no fresh bread available for the road.</char>

        This word closet is the same word Jesus used in 6:6, where he told us to go into a closet and pray in
        secret. It’s no coincidence that these places are repeated in v.26; the countryside, where John the Baptist
        was, is a place of self-denial, of fasting, of repentance. The bedroom (closet) is a place of prayer.
        Both of these are like places for false Messiah’s to appear, as they’d be either fasting or praying.</char>

      <verse number="35" style="v" sid="MAT 27:35" />So they crucified him, rolled dice<char style="sup">[k]</char> to divvy up his clothes, <verse eid="MAT 27:35" />
      <verse number="36" style="v" sid="MAT 27:36" />took a seat, and proceeded to keep track of him there. <verse eid="MAT 27:36" />
      <verse number="37" style="v" sid="MAT 27:37" />They put a sign indicating the reason <char style="it">for his crucifixion</char> over his head which
        read, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.” <verse eid="MAT 27:37" />
      <verse number="38" style="v" sid="MAT 27:38" />At that time, there were two thugs<char style="sup">[l]</char> crucified with him, one to the right of

      <verse number="39" style="v" sid="MAT 27:39" />Those who came by reviled him, nodding their heads <char style="it">back and forth</char> <verse eid="MAT 27:39" />
      <verse number="40" style="v" sid="MAT 27:40" />and saying, “The one who’ll <char style="it">supposedly</char> destroy the temple and rebuild it in three

      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="MAT 27:41" />In the same way, the chief priests, along with the designated teachers<char style="sup">[m]</char> and
        the Pharisees, taunted him saying over and over, <verse eid="MAT 27:41" />
      <verse number="42" style="v" sid="MAT 27:42" />”He rescued others but he can’t rescue himself…So, he’s the King of Israel…Let’s see him come down from

      <verse number="43" style="v" sid="MAT 27:43" />He placed his trust in God; let Him rescue him now if He wants him, since he said that he’s God’s son.”<verse eid="MAT 27:43" />
      <verse number="44" style="v" sid="MAT 27:44" />Likewise, the thugs who were selected to be crucified with him insulted him.<verse eid="MAT 27:44" />

      <verse number="48" style="v" sid="MAT 27:48" />Immediately, one of them ran and fetched a sponge fully soaked with vinegar wine<char style="sup">[E]</char>,

      <verse number="49" style="v" sid="MAT 27:49" />The rest of the people there proceeded to say, “Let’s see if Elijah comes and saves him.” <verse eid="MAT 27:49" />
      <verse number="50" style="v" sid="MAT 27:50" />Again Jesus cried out in a loud voice and gave up the ghost<char style="sup">[n]</char>. <verse eid="MAT 27:50" />
      <verse number="51" style="v" sid="MAT 27:51" />And—just like that—the temple curtain<char style="sup">[F]</char> was torn in two from top to bottom,
        the rocks were shaken, <verse eid="MAT 27:51" />
      <verse number="52" style="v" sid="MAT 27:52" />and the tombs<char style="sup">[G]</char> were opened up and many faithful believers who had died were

      <verse number="53" style="v" sid="MAT 27:53" />and with his resurrection left the tombs and went into the holy city and appeared to lots of people.<verse eid="MAT 27:53" />
      <verse number="54" style="v" sid="MAT 27:54" />The captain of the guard and those who were keeping track of Jesus with him, seeing the earthquake and

      <verse number="59" style="v" sid="MAT 27:59" />Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen, <verse eid="MAT 27:59" />
      <verse number="60" style="v" sid="MAT 27:60" />placed it in his newly-made tomb, which had been hewn into the rock, rolled a huge stone over to the

      <verse number="66" style="v" sid="MAT 27:66" />So they went and secured the tomb, having fortified the rock as it stood against the entrance.<verse eid="MAT 27:66" />

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 28:2" />Wouldn’t you know—a huge convulsion had occurred; in fact, an angel sent from the Lord descended from

        Sabbaths were over, at the first light of the first day from the Sabbaths. </char>As the Jewish day begins
        at sundown, dawn is “well after” a Sabbath. The <char style="it">Sabbaths </char>in v. 1 is plural, but
        idiomatically using the plural for the singular when referring to days of the week occurs a few times
        in the NT (putting aside this verse and the parallel ones in Mark 16:2, Luke 24:1, John 20:1, John 20:19,
        this idiomatic form is found in Luke 4:16; Acts 16:13; Acts 20:7). But there were, in fact, two consecutive
        Sabbaths, the Passover and a Saturday, not just a single Sabbath. This helps with the math of reconciling
        Jesus being supposedly crucified on a Friday and raised from the dead on a Sunday; how does that add
        up to three days? Nor does this account for the three day and three night duration called out in Matt.
        12:40. To achieve a span of three days and three nights, Jesus would’ve been crucified on a Wednesday,
        the day of preparation (Matt. 27:62), and the three days and three nights consisted of Wed. night, Thurs.
        day, Thurs. night, Fri. day, Fri. night, Fri. day. And he was resurrected on Saturday evening, while
        several hours later, early Sunday morning, the women discovered that he’d already been resurrected.</char>
