  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="ipi">John’s Gospel stands apart from the other three—Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Synoptic Gospels—in more
    ways than one. It’s content is different, it’s chronology is different. The Greek that John uses is very
    simple and is, for the most part, readily translated word-for-word into English. However, underneath
    the simplistic wording is an enigmatic book which makes vague, abstract generalizations it does not explain.
    John’s epistles are even more simplistic yet enigmatic and vague.</para>
  <para style="ipi">On the one hand, John’s writing needs a good copy editing. Among other things, he uses the wrong verb
    tenses, is too ambiguous, assuming that the reader will have no problem filling in the missing content.
    Had I submitted something comparable to the way that John writes as a high school term paper, my English
    teachers would’ve marked it all up in red.</para>
  <para style="ipi">On the other hand, John has his own peculiar meaning of words and phrases that differ from everything
    else in the NT and which can only be learned by studying his writings, the simple, vague phrases which
    are enigmatic and profound. In fact, from a language perspective, John’s Gospel should be viewed in a
    separate light from the remainder of the NT, so different is his writing. Inside this simple fisherman
    was a deeply spiritual man, one who was Semitic and not Western, one who used words and grammatical constructs
    his own ways and not the way everyone else does.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Of all the books in the NT, John’s Gospel has enjoyed preeminence from the days of the early church.
    This is proven by the fact that the oldest surviving manuscripts NT manuscripts, and the most numerous
    of the oldest, are of John. And if Matthew was written to Jews, Mark to Romans, Luke to Greeks, then
    John was written to Christians.</para>

      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 1:15" />John testified about him, having cried out, “This fellow here is the one I referred to when I said, ‘The

      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="JHN 1:24" />Now the ones who had been sent were sent by the Pharisees. <verse eid="JHN 1:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="JHN 1:25" />They posed a question asking, “So now, why do you perform baptisms if you’re neither the Messiah, Elijah,
        nor the Prophet?” <verse eid="JHN 1:25" />
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="JHN 1:26" />John replied by saying, “My role is to baptize in water. <char style="it">But s</char>omeone has taken

      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="JHN 1:30" />This is the person whom I referred to when I said, ‘A man’s coming who’ll follow in my footsteps, a man

        I was.’ <verse eid="JHN 1:30" />
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="JHN 1:31" />I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, <char style="it">he was not known even

        reason my role was to come baptizing in water.” <verse eid="JHN 1:31" />
      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="JHN 1:32" />And John solemnly declared in a statement for the record that he had beheld the Spirit coming down out
        of the sky like a dove and remaining upon him from then on: <verse eid="JHN 1:32" />
      <verse number="33" style="v" sid="JHN 1:33" />”I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, the One who sent me to baptize in water,

      <verse number="34" style="v" sid="JHN 1:34" />And I have beheld <char style="it">this event </char>personally and have solemnly attested that this

      <verse number="36" style="v" sid="JHN 1:36" />and saw Jesus going here and there, and interjected, “Look here—God’s lamb.” <verse eid="JHN 1:36" />

      <verse number="39" style="v" sid="JHN 1:39" />Keeping their curiosity, he said, “Come and see.” So they went and saw where he was staying and remained

        disciple was Simon Peter’s brother Andrew. <verse eid="JHN 1:40" />
      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="JHN 1:41" />First thing he did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “I’ve found the Messiah” (which translated
        means ‘Christ’). <verse eid="JHN 1:41" />
      <verse number="42" style="v" sid="JHN 1:42" />He led him to Jesus. Jesus saw him and said, “<char style="wj">You are Simon son of John. You’ll be called

        Jumping right in, Jesus said to him, “Be my follower.” <verse eid="JHN 1:43" />

        The use of the present tense for the past tense is a common figure of speech used in the Gospels. Ref.

      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">But for this verse, this is a special figure of speech, a subcategory of the usage of present for past,
        one where in two consecutive, related clauses (first clause: <char style="it">the light shines in the
        Darkness</char>; second clause: <char style="it">the Darkness couldn’t take it down</char>), the first
        clause uses the present tense, but is understood by the reader to be the past tense, and the following
        clause uses the past tense as expected. This same figure of speech is used in Rev. 12:4a, Rev. 13:14b.
        The usage of such a figure of speech begs the question: what idea, notion, etc. is the writer communicating
        beyond the face-value meaning of the words? Some guesswork is involved, but it appears that the present
        tense in the first clause is similar to some of the modes of the imperfect tense, where in the imperfect
        directs the reader to pause and ponder what was going on as the event was unfolding. In the present-then-past-tense
        clauses, the present tense seems to emphasize a difficulty of some sort—perhaps even a long, drawn-out
        ordeal—and the follow-up past tense clause states with emphasis the outcome of the difficulty.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">I have no beef with you, lady—my time has not yet arrived!</char>…This is the first
        miracle Jesus ever performed (ref. v. 12), and it’s significant that it occurred at a wedding. This wedding
        has a symbolic meaning, and what Jesus says here addresses the symbolism of the event. The wedding symbolizes
        God’s plan for the human race. God intended all of mankind to live life as though it were one long wedding
        celebration of a sort, but then sin entered into the world and spoiled the party. Wine is what generates
        the frivolity and lightens the mood, causing the guests to loosen up and celebrate. Wine symbolizes the
        means by which mankind can enter into life’s celebration. But also, as red wine has a color similar to
        blood, at the same time it’s symbolic of the blood Jesus shed on our behalf. The symbolism is this: the
        party is over until someone supplies the wine (the blood), which brings life back to a dead party. When
        Mary tells Jesus they have no wine, on the symbolic level, she’s telling him to give the blood which
        will restore the human race to its festivities. This is why Jesus replied, <char style="it">my time has
        not yet arrived</char>—the time for him to shed his blood had not yet arrived.</char>

        The feud between the Jews and the Samaritans originated years ago when the northern tribes of Israel
        under Rehoboam (and the Samaritans are descended from them) severed ties with Judah. A political problem
        arose for Rehoboam, in that the temple was in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. He figured if his newly-seceded
        kingdom were to continue their pilgrimages to the Jerusalem temple, their sentiments and affections,
        and hence their political loyalty, would eventually return to Judah. For this reason, Rehoboam instituted
        religious observances in the north; this Samaritan woman refers to this.</char>

        The OT worship consisted of appearances before priests at the temple, which included (but was not limited
        to) sacrificial offerings. NT worship is not like that; NT worship in its essence is spiritual. Humans
        are spiritual beings, God is a spirit, and we offer Him worship out of our spirits. No physical forms
        are necessary to do this, but man with his religious tendencies yields to the temptation of supplanting
        spiritual worship with physical or emotional forms.</char>

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JHN 5:1" />After these <char style="it">things occurred</char>, there was a Jewish <char style="it">holiday</char>
        festival, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <verse eid="JHN 5:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="JHN 5:2" />Among the citizens of Jerusalem, there was a pool at the Sheep Gate (which in Aramaic is called Bethesda),
        which has five porticos. <verse eid="JHN 5:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JHN 5:3" />In these <char style="it">porticos</char> lay a multitude of those who are feeble with sicknesses of
        one sort or another<char style="sup">[a]</char>, of the blind, the lame, and those with shriveled-up
        <char style="it">limbs</char>, perpetually lying there. <verse eid="JHN 5:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="JHN 5:4" /><char style="sup">[A]</char> <verse eid="JHN 5:4" />
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="JHN 5:5" />Now there was a man with a sickness who had been there for thirty-eight years, and his sickness made
        him feeble. <verse eid="JHN 5:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="JHN 5:6" />Seeing this fellow lying there, Jesus, knowing that he had been there for a long time, engaged him in
        conversation and said, <char style="wj">“Do you want to get better?” </char><verse eid="JHN 5:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="JHN 5:7" />The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no person to toss me into the pool when the water’s been agitated<char
        style="sup">[B]</char>. While it’s <char style="it">agitated</char> and I’m on my way <char style="it">to
        the pool, </char>someone else cuts in front of me.<char style="sup">[b]</char>” <verse eid="JHN 5:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JHN 5:8" />Jesus got to the point and said, <char style="wj">“Get up, pick the cot up, take it, and walk around,”</char><verse eid="JHN 5:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="JHN 5:9" />and the man got better immediately, picked his cot up, and walked around.</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 5:9">But that was on a Sabbath. <verse eid="JHN 5:9"/>
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="JHN 5:10" />So now, the Judean Jews proceeded to say to the man who had been healed,</para>
    <para style="p" vid="JHN 5:10">“It’s the Sabbath, and you’re not allowed to pick up your cot and take it <char style="it">somewhere</char>.”<verse eid="JHN 5:10"/>
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 5:11" />He replied, “The guy who made me well told me, <char style="wj">‘Pick it up and walk around’</char>.”<verse eid="JHN 5:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="JHN 5:12" />They asked, “Who’s the person who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk around’?” <verse eid="JHN 5:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="JHN 5:13" />But the man who was healed didn’t know who it was; you see, Jesus had ducked out of sight and into the
        crowd. <verse eid="JHN 5:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JHN 5:14" />After all of this<char style="sup">[c]</char>, Jesus found him in the temple and said, <char style="wj">“I
        see you’re all better now. Don’t go about sinning, lest something worse happen to you.”</char> <verse eid="JHN 5:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="JHN 5:15" />The man left from there and reported to the Judeans that Jesus was the one who made him better. <verse eid="JHN 5:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="JHN 5:16" />Because of this, the Judeans began to go after Jesus, because he did this<char style="sup">[c]</char>
        on the Sabbath. <verse eid="JHN 5:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JHN 5:17" />Jesus’s reply to them was, <char style="wj">“Up to the present moment, my Father’s been doing </char><char
        style="it"><char style="wj">good</char></char><char style="wj"> deeds, and is doing good deeds, and so

      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="JHN 5:18" />So because of this, the Judeans were all the more trying to kill him, because he wasn’t just going about
        freeing <char style="it">people</char> <char style="it">from their sicknesses</char> on the Sabbath,
        but he also kept saying that God is his own Father, making himself out to be equal to God.<verse eid="JHN 5:18" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="JHN 5:19" />So Jesus proceeded to defend himself, <char style="wj">“I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth,

        time to time, or perhaps some of the water was discharged from a feeding aqueduct and as a side-effect
        of the pool being refilled, the rushing water caused the agitation. </char>

        vetting a prophet (Exod. 7:9; Deut.13:1–5). As John has stated in length in earlier parts of his gospel,
        Jesus did miraculous signs. In fact, the crowd had just chased him down because he’d walked on water.
        The problem was that that wasn’t good enough—they wanted him to produce a miracle on-demand. This is
        symptomatic of unbelief, the stubborn refusal to believe.</char>

        him up</char> in Gk. is equivalent to <char style="it">resurrect him</char>, and in the NT resurrection
        refers to <char style="it">life-after-death</char>. A phrase like the Last Day is similar to other phrases
        found in the Bible, such as the <char style="it">last days</char> [plural] (Isa. 2:2; Mic. 4:1; Acts
        2:17; 2 Tim. 3:1; 2 Pet. 3:3); <char style="it">the last hour</char>; <char style="it">those days</char>;
        <char style="it">that day</char>; etc. All these phrases in general refer to the time of a fulfillment
        of a prophecy or a promise of some sort. According to its usage in the NT, we are living in the Last
        Days. This means we’re living in the fulfillment of the promises in the OT and in the Gospels of the
        fulfillment of Jesus’s mission to die and to be resurrected and the consequent access to God through
        faith in him, even for the Gentile; the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in all believers; God working through
        the church; etc. But the Last Day [singular] refers to the fulfillment of a different promise, that is,
        what God will do with those who died, in this case with believers who died trusting in Him. For unbelievers,
        the Last Day is the Day of Judgment.</char>

        Joseph as Jesus’s father, then a few words later refer to him as <char style="it">the father </char>instead
        of saying <char style="it">Joseph </char>again. The insinuation is that they have a low opinion about
        Mary and Joseph. This could be for a few reasons, because Mary and Joseph don’t live in Judea and aren’t
        part of the political hierarchy. Or because they’re poor, they’re common laborers. Or perhaps Mary’s
        virgin birth was assumed to be an adulterous relationship. But whatever low opinion they had of Mary

      <char style="ft">Verses 1-11 of this chapter (and John 7:53b, the verse right before) are the story of the woman caught
        in adultery. For reference, this is translated in the note following. This story indeed is a beautiful
        illustration of the gospel, and this is the reason why it was spliced into the Gospel of John after John
        wrote it, as it is a spurious addition: the external evidence (i.e. the manuscript evidence) is overwhelming.</char>

      <char style="ft">As far as the internal aspects of this passage (and this is quite subjective), the GT of this passage
        appears to be more polished than what John writes (John’s text is herky-jerky); this passage is more
        fluid and therefore easier to translate that what’s found in John’s gospel. Furthermore, John tends to
        shy away from using specific, descriptive words such as v. 4/<char style="it">in the very act </char>(<char
        style="it">ep autophoros</char>,  ἐπ&apos; αὐτοφώρῳ); vv. 6,7,8,10/<char style="it">crouched down</char>

        and the Pharisees brought him a woman caught by surprise in adultery, and stood her right in front of
        everyone. 4They said to him, “Teacher, this here woman was caught in the very act of adultery. 5Now in
        the Law of Moses it’s commanded that such a person be stoned to death. So what do you have to say?” 6They
        were saying this to test him, so that they would have something to accuse him of. Jesus was crouched
        down and kept on writing on the ground. 7As they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and
        asked them, “Let he who’s without sin throw the first stone.” 8He crouched down again and continued writing
        on the ground. 9One by one, the listeners began to leave, from the oldest, and he was left alone, the
        woman being right in front. 10Jesus straightened up and told her, “Woman, where are they? No one’s condemning
        you.” 11She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Nor do I condemn you. Go and, from now on, don’t sin anymore.”</char>

        normally work—say—ten hours, but quit work early enough so there was enough time to walk home in the
        daylight, receive your daily wage (ref. Matt. 20:8), or whatnot. When night arrives, it gets too dark
        to get any work done, etc. He would only work in the field until sunset if he had to, like during harvest,
        when there was too much work and barely enough time to do it. This is what Jesus meant by working until
        there’s no more daylight—there’s way too much to do and not enough time to do it in (i.e. working overtime;
        crunch time). Jesus uses a similar analogy about daylight in John 11:9,10 also.</char>

        Lev. 15, the entire chapter). Lev. 15:5 states that one should wash himself after being in contact with
        a bodily discharge of any sort; hence Jesus’s instruction for the man to bathe himself. Why Jesus rubbed
        the saliva-mud on the man’s eyes in the first place is anyone’s guess…</char>

        <char style="it">a thief and a robber</char>. This is a hendiadys; ref. note of Matt. 3:11. The two Gk.
        words here for <char style="it">thief </char>and <char style="it">robber </char>are differentiated in
        a similar fashion to their English renderings. Generally speaking, a thief attempts to avoid confrontation
        when stealing; a robber, on the other hand, assaults the person or persons whom he steals from. A robber
        therefore employs physical harm and violence on a regular basis, and is a much rougher, belligerent,
        and violent criminal than the ordinary thief. In this hendiadys, Jesus explains that this thief is not
        your ordinary thief, but one who commits unwarranted and wanton acts of violence in addition to his thievery.
        When Jesus speaks of the thief in v. 10, the thief he refers to is the same one he describes in vv. 1,8.
        So the thief of v. 10 is a violent destructive thief, not just simply a larcenist.</char>

        split fairly evenly on whether the phrase <char style="it">in front of </char>me/<char style="it">prior

        No matter what’s chosen, the reader is left scratching his head trying to figure out the point that Jesus
        through John was trying to get across. My guess (and it is very much a guess) is that the phrase is spurious;
        I have added the word <char style="it">by </char>as a weak guess at an interpolation, which leaves unspecified

        for a couple of verses. The sheep must pass through the door to get into the pen and must pass through
        the door to get out of the pen. While they are in the pen, they are <char style="it">kept safe from harm
        </char>(also v. 9). While they are out of the pen, they can <char style="it">find pasture, </char>i.e.
        eat, drink, etc. The sheep must divide their time between the pen and the pasture; they cannot stay in
        the one or the other for too long a period. Therefore, they are constantly being shuttled into and out
        of the pen, and must pass through the door—and this door is narrow—each time. If they’re in the pen for
        too long, they’ll need to get out; if they’re in the pasture for too long, they’ll need to get in. They
        must pass through the door in order to have their needs met, in summary.</char>

        that John was propped up on his arm (hand on side of head, elbow on the couch); in v. 25 the Gk. text

        his stomach and chest. He leaned back so that his head would be in close proximity to Jesus’s head, so

        GT is a figure of speech. But what is actually meant is arduousness. In order for Jesus to prepare a
        place, he must first endure the cross, and only then afterwards, being resurrected and ascending to the
        Father, can he prepare a place. He having to go to the cross is not tentative but arduous; hence the

        Obvious to the reader of the GT, v. 14 is a repetition of v. 13a. The difference between the wording
        in these two verses is that v. 13 is a more compact repetition, omitting a few words with the confidence
        that the reader will understand that they were omitted for brevity. Therefore, the repetition of the
        statement is a figure of speech, one where Jesus wants to be clear about what he’s saying and to emphasize
        it.</char>

        </char>say, “We’re coming with you.” They left, boarded the boat <char style="it">they used for fishing,

        Simon Peter, after he heard that it’s the Lord, took off the coat which was wrapped around him (he was
