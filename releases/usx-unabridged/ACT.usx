  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke writes another long treatise for Theophilus, who may have been his former master, a sequel to his
    Gospel. He picks up the story as he left off in his Gospel, and by the time he reaches Acts 16:10 the
    narrative switches from <char style="it">they </char>to <char style="it">we</char>, as Luke joins Paul
    on his journeys.</para>
  <para style="ipi">The book is named Acts of the Apostles, but it might be better named Acts of the Early Church.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke at times will break into long sentences, like Acts 2:30,31. Of course, this long sentence is a quotation
    from Peter, and in that passage Luke captures a side of Peter which is unseen in the Gospels. In that
    spontaneous oration of Acts 2—which is one of the high points of the entire book—Peter follows a train
    of thought through a few quotations from the Old Testament with remarkable clarity and agility, to the
    point that even his opponents marveled at his newly-found rhetorical abilities (Acts 4:13). These came
    from the Holy Spirit which came upon him on Pentecost.</para>
  <para style="ipi">More so than the other Gospel writers, Luke’s command of Greek allows him to pepper the text with a word
    here or there, broadening the meaning with nuanced implications, some of which take an entire half-sentence
    to convey to the English reader. An example this is in Luke 2:39, where he adds an additional word (<char
    style="it">and</char>).</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke has a knack for finding imaginative metaphors. For example, in Acts 1:17 he compares Judas’s misfortune
    of being the one who betrays Jesus to someone who casts lots and loses. In Acts 2:1, the counting of
    days until Pentecost uses a term commonly used by ship captains as they fill their quota of cargo or
    tackle or whatnot before setting sail. In Acts 9:1, Paul is “still huffing [lit: breathing] murderous
    threats at the Lord’s disciples.” Interspersing hyperbole with metaphor, Acts 17:21 says, “Now all Athenians
    and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for anything other than talking about or hearing about
    something novel.”</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke quietly introduces Paul (Saul)—who after Jesus is the most influential figure in Christianity—in
    Acts 7:58 by showing him in the backdrop of the stoning of Stephen, letting the circumstances describe
    who Paul was rather than a description itself. Luke uses this introduction to transition from Stephen’s
    stoning at the end of the seventh chapter into Paul’s zealous persecution at the beginning of the eighth,
    eventually culminating in Saul’s conversion. In his deft use of indirection, in Acts 12:18, instead of
    directly saying “…a lot of commotion took place..,” he says instead, “When daylight came, no small amount
    of commotion took place among the soldiers.”</para>
  <para style="ipi">An additional benefit gleaned from Luke’s narrative here is that it sheds light on expressions and idioms
    used throughout the NT. There are several occurrences of the expression “name of Jesus” where a character
    is doing this or that in the name of Jesus. The student of the Bible deduces the underlying meaning of
    the name of Jesus by its preponderance in Acts. Another example is “enter God’s kingdom” (Acts 14:22):
    the context of this verse indicates that this is an idiom, and one should keep that in mind when Jesus
    says how difficult it is for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom.</para>
  <para style="ipi">In the earlier chapters of Acts, much of the dialog and wording sheds light on certain NT concepts. The
    fourth chapter specifies what the name of Jesus is; in Acts 4:9, we have captured in writing an incident
    of testing the Lord, and this expanded understanding of what it is to test the Lord sheds light on other
    NT verses, in this case for example, Matt. 4:7, 1 Cor. 10:9.</para>
  <para style="ipi">To top it off, a pattern emerges in the story line, and it goes like this: a miracle occurs, the miracles
    draws the undivided attention of those who witness it, as their attention is captured, the message of
    the Gospel is delivered, and those who hear it are converted. Treats like that are found by those who
    look for them.</para>

        there remains ambiguity and uncertainty of what exactly Luke was talking about in this verse. </char>

        and does not say that it was a command, confirmed by what Peter said in Acts 5:4. Second, the apostles
        were convinced that Jesus would return to earth any day now—certainly no more than a few weeks hence—so
        what’s the use of owning property? Third, Acts 8:1 said that there was a great persecution against the
        church in Jerusalem. In such a persecution, those persecuted would surely have had their property confiscated,
        so they might’ve anticipated this and sold what they owned preemptively. Fourth, not everyone sold what
        they owned; otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to meet from house to house (v. 46), as there wouldn’t
        have been any houses to meet at. Fifth, this was an extraordinary period of revival, and extraordinary

        themselves. Throughout the Bible, the word <char style="it">feet </char>is symbolic of what a person
        does at a high-level, or the things a person does which are more involved than simple actions. The word
        <char style="it">hand </char>is for simple actions, but <char style="it">feet </char>is symbolic of something
        which requires a sequence of actions to complete. In this verse here, Peter’s synecdoche indicates what
        the young men are about to do. Of particular interest is how deeply rooted such figures of speech were
        in the Israelis of that time, that they were used in impromptu, conversational speech such as this. We
        can assume that Jesus talked the same way; passages such as Matt. 18:8, though they sound out of place
        to the modern ear, were commonplace remarks for the time and place. </char>

        Not absolutely certain, but this appears to be an idiom/expression. This phrase paints a picture of someone
        sitting or lying on the ground when the sun’s shining, and someone else walks up to this person stands
        near them in such a way as to block the sun. Sometimes movies, especially Westerns, have scenes like
        this where a stronger person approaches a weaker person and blocks the sun when close. The weaker person
        squints up until when the stronger person is close, and he no longer needs to squint because of the shadow
        provided by the stronger person. The stronger person has come by to have an encounter of some sort with
        the weaker person—in this case, for Peter the stronger, the one standing, to heal the weaker one, who’s
        sitting or lying due to his weakness.</char>

        (Luke 2:9 for example) to clarify any ambiguity as to the meaning of <char style="it">angel</char>, specifying
        the angelic being as opposed to a human being. Since the word <char style="it">angel </char>is rendered
        a couple different ways into English, once in English there’s no need to retain the words <char style="it">of

        the listener normally hears used, the act of crucifixion is described in more detailed, graphical terms.
        To illustrate by analogy, if we were to describe someone being executed by electrocution in the following
        way: “We shaved his head, strapped him in a chair, put electrodes on his head and legs, and jolted him
        with electricity,” instead of simply saying, “We electrocuted him,” which every listener would understand.
        The point of such figures of speech is to illustrate how barbaric the act was, as the well-known words,
        being overly used, desensitizes one to the reality of what was perpetrated. </char>

        of other translations rendering this <char style="it">the Spirit</char>, short for <char style="it">the

        to a deeply-rooted disposition of one sort or another (example of that is 2 Tim. 1:7). The NT writers
        understood the potential for ambiguity, and if, when writing, they were referring to the Holy Spirit,
        they added qualifiers to the word <char style="it">spirit </char>where ambiguity might exist. (Or they
        added qualifiers for emphasis.) The qualifiers consist of adding an article, adding the word <char style="it">Holy</char>,
        or<char style="it"> </char>forming a full predicative construct. So in v. 5, such a qualifier is added,
        as Stephen is <char style="it">full of the Holy Spirit</char>, not <char style="it">full of spirit</char>.
        But the usage in v. 3 has no qualifiers, is paired with another personal quality <char style="it">wisdom</char>,

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">put in charge of this matter</char>…This key phrase indicates why the seven—the first
        church deacons—had to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do their job. They were put in charge
        of the food distribution in order to ensure that it was being done fairly, that widows were not being
        overlooked because of their ethnicity. This required spirit and wisdom. But it is not a necessary prerequisite
        for the ordinary church worker to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do the simple, mundane
        labor that all churches require (such as being an usher, a greeter, etc.). Faithfulness and a willingness
        to work with others is about all such a worker needs. Furthermore, the takeaway from this passage is
        that a deacon is an overseer, one who can oversee an area of responsibility which is fraught with moral
        challenges; the run-of-the-mill church worker is not a deacon. If the qualification for every church
        worker was that he had to be filled with spirit and wisdom (in addition to being faithful and getting
        along with others), then there would be very few church workers, and much work would remain undone. Also,

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">took their jackets off and set them next to an aspiring young man named Saul</char>…The
        removal of the jackets (cloaks actually) was done so that the witnesses would be able to move about more
        freely when casting the stones. It’s also a gesture of intent, analogous to high school boys who are
        about to get into a fight and taking off their jackets and showing how tough they are while doing so.
        Once the high school boy takes off his jacket, he turns a person next to him and hands him his jacket
        for safekeeping. Now the boy who’s about to get into a fight would’ve been flanked by his close friends,
        so the person he hands his jacket to is a close friend. All of this paints a picture of who Saul was;
        he was standing next to the witnesses, so he was part of the inner clique, someone who was trusted, someone
        who, though younger, was permitted to tag along closely with the high-priest-caste. When the witnesses
        put their jackets next to Saul, the assumption was that Saul was responsible for their safekeeping. As
        the witnesses quickly scanned their throng looking for someone to entrust their jackets to, Paul was
        the logical choice because of his trustworthiness, his close proximity to the witnesses (indicating his
        zeal), and his youth (indicating that he was the younger among elders). It’s more appropriate to give
        a young man menial duties than someone who’s older and more senior.</char>

      <char style="ft">vs. 37 would read: <char style="it">Philip said, “If you believe with all of your heart, you may.” He
        said in response, “I believe the Son of God to be Jesus Christ.”</char> This verse is not to be found
        in almost all of the best manuscripts, and is therefore a spurious addition. Verse 37 is instructive
        of text added years after Luke wrote Acts. Rather than attempting to propagate a lie, it attempts to
        embellish the text.</char>

      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="ACT 9:22" />But Saul proceeded to become all the more forceful and confounded the Jews living in Damascus, demonstrating

      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="ACT 9:24" />but their plot became known to Saul. They even started monitoring the gates closely, not just by day

      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="ACT 9:25" />but <char style="it">in spite of this </char>disciples took him one night and put him all the way through

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="ACT 9:26" />After arriving in Jerusalem, he kept attempting to join up with the disciples, but a lot of them kept

      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="ACT 9:27" />So Barnabas got ahold of him and brought him to the apostles and told them all about him: how he was
        on the road and saw the Lord, and that <char style="it">the Lord</char> spoke to him…how in Damascus
        he was speaking out on behalf of Jesus and all that he stands for<char style="sup">[j]</char>. <verse eid="ACT 9:27" />
      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="ACT 9:28" />He accompanied them while entering and leaving Jerusalem, <char style="it">accompanying them the entire

      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="ACT 9:29" />and he proceeded to speak to and to have discussions—to the point of arguing—with the Greek-speaking

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="31" style="v" sid="ACT 9:31" />So now the church up and down the entire stretch of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced peace, being

    <para style="p">

      <verse number="37" style="v" sid="ACT 9:37" />During that timeframe she happened to get run-down with an illness, becoming sick to the point of death

      <verse number="38" style="v" sid="ACT 9:38" />Lydda being close to Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was over there and sent two men to him asking

    </para>
    <para style="p">

      <verse number="40" style="v" sid="ACT 9:40" />Peter pushed everyone out <char style="it">of the room</char>, and got on his knees and prayed and turned
        to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes and, seeing Peter, sat up. <verse eid="ACT 9:40" />
      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="ACT 9:41" />He gave her a hand and got her up. He called for the set-apart-people<char style="sup">[e]</char> and

      <verse number="42" style="v" sid="ACT 9:42" />What happened became known up and down the entire Joppa <char style="it">stretch</char>, and many believed

        The way it is presented, God left commandments in the OT for His people to burn offerings, then way up
        in the sky sniffs the air for the smell of the sacrifices being burned as He commanded, and is pleased
        when He smells them.</char>

        other passages in the Law of Moses where a person, for example, will be unclean for a while, but then

      <char style="ft">The vision came to Peter when he was hungry and the vision was concerning food—at least superficially.
        In a broader sense, it was redefining what is and isn’t permissible for Peter to do, according to Jewish
        beliefs, and the lifting of the ban on non-kosher foods is applicable to the lifting of the ban on Gentiles
        themselves. And—incidentally—this is one of a few NT passages which teaches that Christians are not subject

        were following his spiritual lead (Acts 10:27) before Peter arrived. The literal wording of Acts 16:33b

        to Antioch (v. 26). In the rift between Barnabas and Paul in Acts 16:36–41, Barnabas’s instincts derived
        from his gift of Encouragement caused him to stand against Paul on John-Mark’s behalf. His instincts

        could become a believer, and this new teaching was the crux of this new movement called “Christianity.”
        Therefore, technically-speaking, a Christian is one who circumvented Judaism and became a believer directly,
        as opposed to a person who’s a part of “the Way,” which is a Jew who becomes a believer in Jesus (ref.
        Acts 9:2). Consequently, in terms of technicalities, it is not possible for a Jew to become a Christian;
        a Jew who believes in Jesus the same way that a Christian does becomes a part of the Way, and not a Christian.
        A Jew can be a genuine believer in Jesus and not renounce his Judaism.</char>

        the synagogue for the first time and were asked if they wanted to stand up and speak to the audience,
        which Paul proceeded to do for a few minutes. This was standard practice back then; nowadays, churches
        won’t even invite those who itinerate in their denomination (if there’s any still around) to speak at
        their church for the weekend that the pastor’s on vacation. Pastors these days completely monopolize
        the pulpit only, occasionally throwing out a bone to their obsequious staff underlings, and only so they
        don’t get discouraged and quit…and—after all—who’s going to speak when the pastor’s on vacation anyways?
        Churches claim to faithfully adhere to the practices of the Bible. They do not. In this day and age of
        the abundant availability of information, over the years they have further restricted what is spoken
        in their church instead.</char>

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ACT 15:1" />A few key people came over from Judea and proceeded to tell them how things ought to be done, instructing<char
        style="sup">[A]</char> the comrades<char style="sup">[a]</char> that you’ve got to be circumcised in
        Moses (<char style="it">i.e. become Jewish and commit to obeying the commandments in the Law of Moses</char>),
        or else you can’t be saved (<char style="it">i.e. receive Christ and walk with him</char>). <verse eid="ACT 15:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ACT 15:2" />No small disagreement and debate occurred between Paul and Barnabas on one side and them on the other,
        and they arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and certain others from among them to go to the apostles and the
        presiding board<char style="sup">[b]</char> in Jerusalem in regard to this debate. <verse eid="ACT 15:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ACT 15:3" />So then those sent forth by the church kept creating tremendous joy among the comrades as they were passing
        through Phoenicia and Samaria recounting the Gentiles’ conversion. <verse eid="ACT 15:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ACT 15:4" />Arriving in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the presiding board, and reported
        what God was doing in conjunction with them.<verse eid="ACT 15:4" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ACT 15:5" />Now a few who belonged to the Pharisee-sect and who had become believers stood up to speak and said that
        <char style="it">the Gentile believers</char> must be circumcised (<char style="it">and thus convert
        to Judaism</char>) and be ordered to adhere to the Law of Moses, <verse eid="ACT 15:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ACT 15:6" />and the apostles and the presiding board got together to look into this matter. <verse eid="ACT 15:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ACT 15:7" />After much debate took place, Peter stood up and told them:</para>
    <para style="p" vid="ACT 15:7">“Men, comrades: you understand that from the very start (our start that is), God chose that the Gentiles
        hear the Gospel through my mouth and become believers. <verse eid="ACT 15:7"/>
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ACT 15:8" />God, the Knower-Of-The-Heart, went on record and told them that He would give them the <char style="it">baptism
        of the </char>Holy Spirit just like He gave it to us. <verse eid="ACT 15:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ACT 15:9" />After their hearts were cleansed by faith, no one discriminated against them<char style="sup">[c]</char>.<verse eid="ACT 15:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="ACT 15:10" />So at this point in time, you’re trying God’s patience (testing God) by placing an <char style="it">unnecessary</char>
        burden on the disciples (putting a yoke on the disciples’ necks), one which neither our ancestors nor
        we were strong enough to bear. <verse eid="ACT 15:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="ACT 15:11" />No—<char style="it">it’s </char>through the grace of the Lord Jesus that one exercises faith to be saved
        <char style="it">from their sin</char> following the same pattern as those people did.”<verse eid="ACT 15:11" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ACT 15:12" />The whole lot of them fell silent and began to listen to Barnabas and Paul explain the miracles<char
        style="sup">[d]</char> that God did among the Gentiles through them. <verse eid="ACT 15:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="ACT 15:13" />After their silence, James<char style="sup">[B]</char> responded, “Men, comrades, listen to me. <verse eid="ACT 15:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="ACT 15:14" />Simon explained the way that, for the first time, God paid a visit—a caring, helping type of visit—in
        order to form a <char style="it">unique group of </char>people from out of the Gentiles, a people consecrated

      <verse number="32" style="v" sid="ACT 15:32" />Judas and Silas as well exhorted and encouraged the comrades by means of many short <char style="it">prophetic</char>

        in v. 33. The context together with the choice of this word seems to insinuate that Paul and Barnabas’s
        bed and board was provided by some other party, whoever was hosting them at the moment. When they were
        “released,” the hosts were relieved of the responsibility of providing for them. In v. 33, <char style="it">they
        were released back to the ones who sent them, </char>means that the ones who sent them were to start
        providing meals for them. Here and there in his epistles, Paul addresses the support which he receives
        (or doesn’t receive) from his hosts; 1 Cor. 9:11 is one example. The support of ministers of the Gospel
        has been a thorny issue from the inception of Christianity, and not only that but in the OT as well in
        regard to Priests and Levites. Suffice to say that congregations, like the example in vv. 30,33 here,
        should assume the responsibility of providing for the pastor or pastors who lead their congregation and
        furthermore for the itinerating speakers who speak at their church. Like this passage here in Acts, congregations
        should take ownership of that responsibility rather than the pastor having to force the issue.</char>

        with other details in the narrative. In v. 27, the jail keeper was awakened from his sleep by the earthquake,
        as he was sleeping on the upper floor of the same building which was shaken. Also, the problem of sending
        a message across town in the middle of the night to awaken his family and have them come to the prison
        (and many cities had curfews back then too) is solved. Verse 33 says that all of them were baptized <char

        This is when they received Christ as Lord. An open question is whether they were baptized in water a

        But in any case, after being “baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus” (after believing in Jesus), they
        were baptized in the Holy Spirit, thus demonstrating once again that, generally speaking, the baptism

        different meanings (or multiple meanings at the same time). What should be kept in mind is that a synagogue
        is first and foremost an assembly of people, in the same way that a church is an assembly of people,
        and secondly a building or some other premise. Therefore, this expression means: He introduced himself
        to those in the synagogue and attended one of their meetings; He became a member of the synagogue; He
        became affiliated with the synagogue; He visited the synagogue. It may be that this expression denotes
        a formal custom of introduction where a new member is greeted by those in the synagogue. As part of this,
        the new member’s credentials are submitted, and if he’s learned enough in the Scriptures, he’ll be given
        the opportunity to stand before the synagogue and teach—or at least to talk in smaller, more informal

        whipping Paul. This statement by Paul, similar circumstances as 16:37, refutes certain preconceived ideas
        connected with “turning the other cheek” (Matt. 5:39). Namely, when Jesus said to turn the other cheek,
        he didn’t mean that a person should not press for what’s rightfully his when being walked over.</char>

        custody of Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, a member of the Imperial Battalion<char

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="ACT 27:2" />We boarded a ship in Adramyttium which was about to sail down the Turkish<char style="sup">[c]</char>
        coast and hoisted sail, while Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, accompanied us. <verse eid="ACT 27:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="ACT 27:3" />The next day we stopped at Sidon. Julius did a kind deed for Paul and permitted him to go to his friends
        and receive care for his health. <verse eid="ACT 27:3" />
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="ACT 27:4" />From there we set out to sea and sailed the long way, on the eastern side of Cyprus, because the winds

      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="ACT 27:6" />There, the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and we boarded it. <verse eid="ACT 27:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="ACT 27:7" />After several days of making slow headway, we showed up over in Cnidus. Because the wind wasn’t in our
        favor, we sailed the long way around Crete down the coast of Salmone <verse eid="ACT 27:7" />
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="ACT 27:8" />and with difficulty sailed along the coast and came to some place called Fair Havens, which is near a

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="ACT 27:9" />As a good amount of time had gone by, and it being dangerous to travel <char style="it">on the Mediterranean

      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ACT 27:12" />Now since the harbor there was unsuitable for passing the winter, the majority decided to hoist sail
        and leave, if perchance they could make it to Phoenix and pass the winter there, which is a harbor in
        Crete which faces southwest and has a northwesterly wind.<verse eid="ACT 27:12" />

      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="ACT 27:16" />Running under the protection of a small island called Cauda, we were just barely able to get the ship

      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="ACT 27:29" />and fearing that we’d smash against the rocks, we cast four anchors off the ship’s stern and began to

      <verse number="41" style="v" sid="ACT 27:41" />They encountered a place where two bodies of water converge and ran the ship aground. While the bow stayed

        between an angel and a messenger, as the word means either. But in English, we simply say “angel” instead
        of the word-for-word rendering “angel of the Lord.” But in v. 23, Paul takes opportunity of the word

        and not to be taken literally. From the sounds of it, this is the same expression as is found in Matt.
        10:30; Luke 12:7; what Jesus said there can also be understood as an expression and is not to be taken

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">They gave us many donatives as an allowance</char>…Lit: <char style="it">They honored

        (the multi-faceted meaning propagated to the English <char style="it">honor</char> vs. <char style="it">honorarium</char>).
        This is in the form of a monetary obligation, pay, or entitlement. That the usage here of <char style="it">honor
        </char>refers to contributing financially is supported by these three facts: First, the words <char style="it">many
        honors </char>insinuate something which is quantitative (cash or items) rather than qualitative (honor
        or respect). Second, the latter half of v. 10 (“put necessities on the ship”) also concerns itself with
        giving material goods. Third, the word <char style="it">honor </char>is also used this way in 1 Tim.

        with one another one prices, etc., sort of like how airlines offer flights and compete with one another.</char>
