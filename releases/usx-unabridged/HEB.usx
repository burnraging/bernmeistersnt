  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="ipi">The Book of Hebrews is a treatise. The subject matter is the comparison between the Old and New Testaments,
    proving that the new covenant is better than the old covenant. Though veering off into many subjects,
    it returns to its principal subject.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Because of the intensity, a translator must concentrate intensely while translating, juggling both the
    translation and following the thread of reasoning. Interpolations must be supplied at critical junctures,
    otherwise the meaning risks being lost.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Speculations will forever abound as to who wrote this book, and the only evidence we can use to support
    any theory is from an analysis of the text itself and a comparison to the other writings of the New Testament.
    One piece of such evidence is that whoever wrote Hebrews had a mastery of Greek, it being probable that
    it was his native tongue. Also, he had studied the Septuagint extensively. Although his peculiar writing
    style isn’t immediately recognizable as what we find in Paul’s epistles, one should keep in mind that
    Hebrews is not a letter but an essay, and that the same writer will use one style when writing a letter
    and another when writing an essay. Furthermore, the author says in 13:23 that he’ll take Timothy with
    him when he travels: that sounds like Paul.</para>
  <para style="ipi">On the other hand, a simple word such as <char style="it">whence </char>[<char style="it">hothen, </char><char
    style="w" strong="G03606">ὅθεν</char>)] is found in Hebrews in 2:17, 3:1, 7:25, 8:3, 9:18, 11:19, but
    is nowhere to be found in any of Paul’s writing. One would a simple word like that to be independent
    of whether what’s being written is an essay or an epistle.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Studying the entire book, we come to the conclusion that the writer was influenced by Paul’s teachings.
    As the last part of the last chapter talks about Timothy, he had to be a close associate of Paul’s, at
    the bare minimum; but whether it was actually Paul who wrote it, we’ll never know.</para>

        to be inheriting salvation</char>…Or: <char style="it">those who are going to be receiving salvation</char>…Some
        notes on the GT. The Gk. verb <char style="it">mellō </char><char style="w" strong="G03195">μέλλω</char>)can
        mean <char style="it">about to be</char>, <char style="it">going to be</char>, or perhaps <char style="it">destined
        to be</char>. Naturally, its meaning is decided by context. Something else which is noteworthy is that
        the infinite <char style="it">inherit </char>has a verb tense which insinuates ongoing action, as opposed
        to a one-time action. So the heirs are about to be inheriting, going to be inheriting, or destined to
        be inheriting salvation on an ongoing basis. This begs the question, what does <char style="it">salvation
        </char>mean in this context? Many Christians, scholars, and translators assume it means “receiving Christ
        in the new birth” or something similar. When applying this definition to this verse, the dilemma is that
        the angels are sent to assist only those who are about to or are going to inherit salvation, not those
        who already have inherited it, as the word <char style="it">mellō </char>refers to something which is
        going to happen in the future but hasn’t happened yet. For this reason, in this verse the word <char
        style="it">salvation </char>does not mean receiving Christ in the new birth, but it means being rescued
        from catastrophe. This is its core meaning anyways, so the only surprise should be that Christian scholars
        failed to apply it properly in the first place. The last piece to the puzzle is the meaning of <char
        style="it">inherit. </char>The Gk. and English meanings are essentially the same: it means coming and
        actually possessing what’s been set aside as yours, what’s rightfully yours. Inheriting salvation here
        is not being born-again some time in the future, but it means coming into the relief in a dire situation
        of that which is rightfully yours, a person who is already a Christ-follower. Angels are sent to assist
        Christ-followers with coming into the relief which is rightfully theirs, and to come into this relief
        on an ongoing basis.</char>

        sentence, “What is man that you would remember him, or the son of man that you would visit him?” is a

        more detail added in the restatement. The initial statement is incomplete; the restatement completes
        it. Therefore, the one spoken of in this passage is the “son of man,” not mankind in general. Some have
        taken this passage (and also Psalm 8, where it’s quoted from) and have taught that mankind in Christ
        has been crowned with glory and honor and has had all things subordinated to him. That’s not the case;
        this passage is talking about the son of man, which in this passage specifically refers to Jesus. Verse
        9 makes this even more clear by saying that it was Jesus who was “demoted somewhat lower than the angels”
        and was “crowned in glory and honor.”</char>

        is the case. In fact, therapōn is the word used in the phrase “Moses My servant” which appears in the

        Hiketāria refers to “the olive branch which a supplicant held in his hand” (Liddell &amp; Scott). Also
        see Gen. 8:11. Meyer in his commentary says that hiketāria “denotes the olive branch which the supplicant

        </char><char style="w" strong="G00145">αἰσθητήριον</char>), which means the perception formed from external
        stimuli. In this context, it refers to the capacity to understand, to gain insight, and to exercise discernment
        based on information which one obtains through all sources that a person obtains information from. This
        is additionally confirmed by the choice of the Gk. word used for <char style="it">good </char>in this
        verse [<char style="it">kalos</char>, (καλῶς /Strong’s 2773)], as this word refers to goodness perceived
        from the outside, as opposed to goodness which exists on the inside of someone. The goodness is perceived
        from the outside through the faculties of perception spoken of here. But in practical terms, what the
        writer of Hebrews is referring to is a person who through practice and experience is able to observe
        a given situation and through little pieces of information gleaned here and there is able to see the
        good and the evil in that situation, and distinguish between the two. One example is this: years ago
        my brother-in-law used to top by my mother-in-law’s apartment briefly, bring friends occasionally, and
        after listening to these guys talk casually a bit could tell if they were no good or not. She was always
        right. Another example: I’m thinking of a well-known evangelist who had a huge ministry who died a few
        years ago. Just about everyone in the city in which he lived either praised him as a great saint who
        could do no wrong or condemned him as a horrible sinner who could do no right. The truth is that he was
        a mixture of both good and bad, but hardly anyone in the city would say that that was the case. The problem,
        you see, is that they couldn’t distinguish good from bad.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">baptisms</char>…The Gk. word <char style="it">baptismos </char><char style="w" strong="G00909">βαπτισμός</char>),
        derived from the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char><char style="w" strong="G00907">βαπτίζω</char>).
        The connection to the word <char style="it">baptism </char>is obvious; nearly every (perhaps every) rendering
        of <char style="it">baptism </char>in English comes from these words. Some translations like the NASB
        render this “instructions about washings,” which is incorrect. First, the words “instructions about”
        are an interpolation (that is to say, they don’t exist in the GT and were added to make sense of the
        text). Second, “instructions about washings” are covered in “repentance from dead works”; no need to
        cover it again. Third, the context decides any ambiguity. This word <char style="it">baptismos</char>
        appears four times in the NT, here and in 2 Cor. 2:12; Mark 7:4; Heb. 9:10. The times in which it means
        a dipping in water or ceremonial washings are obvious by the context. As this passage is about “fundamental
        doctrines,” is not baptism a fundamental doctrine? Have their not been entire denominational splits over
        this issue? Is it not a pillar of the Christian faith? Fourth, although <char style="it">baptismos </char>as
        used in the NT is context-variable, the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char>is mostly used to refer
        to baptism. Fifth, those who render <char style="it">baptismos</char> as “instructions about washings”
        do so primarily to avoid the obvious fact that this word is plural (baptisms) not singular (baptism).
        They do so because they believe there is only one type of baptism relevant to the church today, namely
        water baptism, and if they were to render this word literally as what it obviously is—baptisms—they would
        they would be forced to acknowledge that there is a second baptism, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and
        that this baptism wasn’t just for the early church but is for believers today.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">eternal judgment</char>…The “fundamental doctrines of Christ” should be understood as
        the essential doctrines of Christianity. A brief description: “repentance from dead works” is the abandonment
        of the notion that obeying the Law of Moses or any other list of rules is your ticket to obtaining righteousness.
        This is coupled with “faith in God”: that we obtain righteousness by faith. As these are the crux of
        Paul’s message, the writer of Hebrews was at a minimum a disciple of Paul. Next are the “doctrines”:
        baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead coupled with eternal judgment. The doctrine
        of baptisms is that a person who accepts Christ as Savior should be immediately baptized in water without
        delay. Also, there is a second baptism which occurs after accepting Christ, that is the baptism in the
        Holy Spirit. It is accompanied by speaking in tongues. The doctrine of the laying on of hands institutes
        a holy ordinance for the church to practice in the form of one or several believers placing their hands
        on another believer while at the same time praying. This was done in the Bible for praying for the sick,
        for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and for ordination into the ministry. The next doctrine is the resurrection
        of the dead, which in the NT refers to life after death. The doctrine asserts that we don’t cease to
        exist when we die, but that we live on eternally in another life, in another body, be it eternal bliss
        or eternal damnation. The final doctrine, one which connect s to the previous, is eternal judgment: that
        when our lives are over, we will stand before God in judgment, the outcome for which will be rewards
        and punishments.</char>

      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 8:3" />You see, every high priest is appointed to go about offering offerings plus sacrifices on top of that;

      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="HEB 9:15" />Because of this, he’s the mediator of a new covenant, so that, considering that a death occurred for

      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="HEB 9:19" />In fact, once every commandment in the Law was spoken to all the people by Moses, taking the blood of

      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="HEB 9:25" />Nor is it the case that he repetitively<char style="sup">[l]</char> brings himself <char style="it">into

        starting the moment the human race began<char style="sup">[m]</char>; but at this this critical moment

      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="HEB 9:28" />in the same way as this, Christ, having been brought forth one time <char style="it">only </char>for
        the purpose of being offered up for the sins of the many, will be seen a second time apart from sin (i.e.,
        he’ll make a second appearance, and this appearance will have nothing to do with atoning for sins) by

      <verse number="1" style="v" sid="HEB 11:1" />Faith is<char style="sup">[A]</char> the undergirding of what’s hoped for, the proof of things not seen
        (which includes all things for which there is no physical evidence); <verse eid="HEB 11:1" />
      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="HEB 11:2" />by this, you see, those we hold in esteem from long ago<char style="sup">[a]</char> had an official account,

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 11:3" />By faith our mind understands that the world was set in order by a sentence spoken by God, resulting
        in what we see coming into being out of what hasn’t been manifested.<verse eid="HEB 11:3" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="4" style="v" sid="HEB 11:4" />By faith Abel offered God a much <char style="it">better </char>sacrifice than Cain, through which an
        attestation to him being righteous was entered <char style="it">into the official record</char>, the
        record specifying the gifts he offered to God, and through <char style="it">his faith</char>, <char style="it">though</char>

      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="HEB 11:5" />By faith Enoch was instantaneously transported from one place to another for the purpose of not experiencing<char

        God had transported him.” You see, before he was transported, it had been stated for the record that

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="HEB 11:6" />Now apart from faith it’s impossible to be well-pleasing to God, for he who approaches God must believe

        fear of God built and provisioned an ark for the purpose of preserving his family and keeping it safe,
        through which <char style="it">faith</char> he condemned the world (i.e., consigned the world to punishment)

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="HEB 11:9" />By faith he emigrated and became a foreign resident in the land of promise, living in tents with Isaac
        and Jacob, joint-heirs of the same promise. <verse eid="HEB 11:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="HEB 11:10" />You see, he anticipated, expected, and was eagerly awaiting the city which is not a rickety-rackety,

        they were foreigners on this planet. <verse eid="HEB 11:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="HEB 11:14" />The fact is, those who say such things make it evident that they seek their native country. <verse eid="HEB 11:14" />

        Some ministers, however, take the word “now” to mean “faith is now” in other words “faith by nature exists

        here-and-now, not some time in the future. While this is true about faith, this is not what the GT of
        11:1 is saying. Other translations’ use of “now” should not be taken to mean “at the present time.”</char>

        We know from the OT account of Esau and Jacob that Esau never committed fornication, which is any act
        of sexual immorality (not just sex out of wedlock). Therefore, the episode where he sold his birthright
        for a bowl of stew is a metaphor to fornication: it’s the same sin but minus the sexual component. Esau
        had convinced himself that he would die if he didn’t eat the meal Jacob prepared (this was not true;
        nobody dies for lack of a single meal, especially someone who can still walk). He exchanged something
        precious for a short-term gratification of the flesh.</char>
