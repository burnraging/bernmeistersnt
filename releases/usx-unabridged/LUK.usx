  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke, the beloved physician (Col . 4:14), the faithful companion of Paul, is the author of one of the
    four officially-sponsored Gospels. We assume that Paul authorized Luke to write it, and since it was
    associated with Paul, it’s target audience was the gentile church, more specifically the Christians planted
    by Paul’s ministry. Evidence points to Luke being a slave or a freedman, serving or having served one
    Theophilus, for whose benefit he writes not only the Gospel of Luke but its sequel, the Book of Acts.</para>
  <para style="ipi">The facts Luke recorded in his Gospel were obtained from him conducting first-hand interviews (he says
    this in 1:2) with many eyewitnesses to the ministry of Jesus. To do this, Luke would have had to have
    spent a few months in Israel, and would have spoken directly with Mary the mother of Jesus and recorded
    her very words in order to obtain such precise details of Jesus’s birth. The likely time of his doing
    these interviews would have been around AD 55, when Paul was in Israel during his third missionary journey.
    Had it been any later than this, these eyewitnesses would have been deceased already, not to speak of
    the sack of Jerusalem in AD 70.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Luke was thorough and meticulous. He was likely a native Greek speaker; his command of Greek surpasses
    Matthew’s, Mark’s, and John’s by a large measure, and is only rivaled by Paul’s and by those who wrote
    the epistles of Jude and Hebrews. Luke has full command of the nuanced richness of the Greek language,
    and he can capture in a word or a word inflection something which takes an entire phrase to render in
    English.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Though Luke has the education and intelligence to write complex, sophisticated passages—which he does
    in Luke 1:1–4—he refrains from doing so and writes in a down-to-earth manner throughout his book. From
    time to time, he dresses up a sentence or two, using colorful wording where more straightforward wording
    would suffice. An example is Luke 7:1; another example is Luke 8:15 “beautiful and morally good;” another
    example is the simile of Luke 22:44, where Luke compares Jesus sweat to drops of blood. But throughout
    the book, he is mindful of detail and correctness, as what he writes must reflect what the eyewitnesses
    told him in face-to-face interviews. In the example of the Pharisee and the tax collector praying at
    the temple (Luke 18:11,13), Luke says that both stood, but uses a different form of the same verb <char
    style="it">to stand, </char>subtlety conveying the difference in their standing postures. Moreover in
    18:13, Luke’s prose garnishes the story beautifully (literal rendering): “But the tax collector standing
    at a distance was not wanting neither to lift up the eyes to heaven.” Luke is sparing in his use of special
    forms and expressions, but by being sparing when he does use special forms, his usage is more effective.
    For example, in Luke 17:37, Luke uses the present tense to mean the past tense—he does not do that often,
    like in the other Gospels.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Of the four Gospels, Luke captures the most sober and chilling warnings of the judgment to come: do the
    right thing or pay for it later, even if the payment might be deferred to the life to come. Some examples
    of this are as follows. Luke 12:20: “Fool—the Grim Reaper is coming for you this very night. Now everything
    you saved away: who’s it going to go to?” Luke 13:8,9: “The gardener considered things and replied, ‘Boss,
    leave it be this year as well; meanwhile, I’ll dig around it and put down fertilizer, and we’ll see if
    it produces figs in the coming year. But if it doesn’t, you can cut it down.” Luke 13:27,28: “Get away
    from me, the lot of you, practitioners of wrong-doing.’ There will be the weeping and the gnashing of
    teeth, at that time when Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets connected with God’s involvement
    with mankind (God’s kingdom) will be seen. Those people, though, get the boot.” Luke 14:24: “I’ll tell
    you this much: not a single one of those people who were invited will taste even a morsel of my dinner.”
    The rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16). Luke 19:27: “However, my enemies, those who didn’t want me to rule
    over them as their king, bring them here and slay them right in front of me.”</para>

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="5" style="v" sid="LUK 1:5" />It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of the Jews, that there was a certain priest named Zechariah,
        from the Order of Abijah, and he had a wife who was of the priestly caste<char style="sup">[C]</char>—and
        her name was Elizabeth. <verse eid="LUK 1:5" />
      <verse number="6" style="v" sid="LUK 1:6" />Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, their conduct, from God’s perspective, was that they
        complied with<char style="sup">[a]</char> all the commandments and <char style="it">expectations of</char>
        correct <char style="it">behavior</char>. <verse eid="LUK 1:6" />
      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="LUK 1:7" />They had no children, because Elizabeth<char style="sup">[C]</char> couldn’t have any children, and both
        were now elderly.<verse eid="LUK 1:7" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="LUK 1:8" />Now during his <char style="it">priestly</char> order’s timeslot in the rotation schedule, he happened
        to be <char style="it">the one</char> performing the priestly duties in the <char style="it">holy</char>
        presence of God<char style="sup">[D]</char> <verse eid="LUK 1:8" />
      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="LUK 1:9" />(<char style="it">the appointment being determined</char> according to the priests’ tradition of rolling
        dice<char style="sup">[b]</char>), having entered into the temple sanctuary <char style="it">itself</char><char
        style="sup">[D]</char> to light the incense; <verse eid="LUK 1:9" />
      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="LUK 1:10" />and everyone who was in the multitude, a multitude of the folk-people, was outside praying during the
        hour of the incense lighting ritual. <verse eid="LUK 1:10" />
      <verse number="11" style="v" sid="LUK 1:11" />So now, an angel sent from the Lord appeared to him standing to the right of the Altar of Incense. <verse eid="LUK 1:11" />
      <verse number="12" style="v" sid="LUK 1:12" />Looking <char style="it">at the angel</char>, Zechariah became disturbed, and fear fell upon him. <verse eid="LUK 1:12" />
      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="LUK 1:13" />The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah; you see, your prayer has been taken to heart, and
        your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you’ll name him John. <verse eid="LUK 1:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="LUK 1:14" />He’ll be a cause of joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice at his birth. <verse eid="LUK 1:14" />
      <verse number="15" style="v" sid="LUK 1:15" />Indeed, he’ll be used mightily by the Lord<char style="sup">[c]</char> and won’t drink wine or liquor—absolutely
        won’t—and he’ll be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb, <verse eid="LUK 1:15" />
      <verse number="16" style="v" sid="LUK 1:16" />and many native Israelites will heed<char style="sup">[d]</char> the Lord their God. <verse eid="LUK 1:16" />
      <verse number="17" style="v" sid="LUK 1:17" />The Lord will use him as a herald in a spirit and power the likeness of which Elijah had<char style="sup">[E]</char>,
        to soften<char style="sup">[e]</char> the hearts of the fathers towards the children, and the skeptics
        and the disobedient<char style="sup">[f]</char> to the sensibility of the ways of the righteous, to bring
        about a fully-refined people for the Lord<char style="sup">[g]</char>.” <verse eid="LUK 1:17" />
      <verse number="18" style="v" sid="LUK 1:18" />Zechariah said to the angel, “Just how will the realization of these things come to me? The fact is,
        I’m old, and my wife is well-past her prime.” <verse eid="LUK 1:18" />
      <verse number="19" style="v" sid="LUK 1:19" />The angel replied, “I am <char style="it">the high-ranking angel</char> Gabriel: the one who stands in
        the presence of God. Concerning these things, He sent me to speak to you and deliver the good news. <verse eid="LUK 1:19" />
      <verse number="20" style="v" sid="LUK 1:20" />See here now—you will remain silent, unable to speak, until the time comes that these things come to
        pass, as a consequence of you not having believed my words, which will be fulfilled in the course of
        good time.”<verse eid="LUK 1:20" />
    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="21" style="v" sid="LUK 1:21" />The people were expecting Zechariah <char style="it">to have come out already </char>and were baffled
        at how long a time he was spending in the temple. <verse eid="LUK 1:21" />
      <verse number="22" style="v" sid="LUK 1:22" />When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he’d seen a vision while inside
        the temple. He was gesturing to them, all the while remaining mute. <verse eid="LUK 1:22" />
      <verse number="23" style="v" sid="LUK 1:23" />When his <char style="it">order’s</char> <char style="it">timeslot for</char> priestly service was up,
        he left to go back home. <verse eid="LUK 1:23" />
      <verse number="24" style="v" sid="LUK 1:24" />Some time afterwards, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and during the five months that she was keeping herself
        in seclusion, she kept on saying, <verse eid="LUK 1:24" />
      <verse number="25" style="v" sid="LUK 1:25" />”<char style="it">All this </char>because<char style="it"> </char>the Lord <char style="it">wanted</char>

    <para style="p">
      <verse number="26" style="v" sid="LUK 1:26" />Now in the sixth month <char style="it">of Elizabeth’s pregnancy</char><char style="sup">[h]</char>,
        God sent the angel Gabriel to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, <verse eid="LUK 1:26" />
      <verse number="27" style="v" sid="LUK 1:27" />to a young, never-married woman<char style="sup">[i]</char> engaged to a man named Joseph, who was a

      <verse number="28" style="v" sid="LUK 1:28" />He entered <char style="it">the physical world </char>right in front of her and said,

      <verse number="29" style="v" sid="LUK 1:29" />Now she was deeply disturbed at the remark and was trying to figure out what the nature of the visit
        would be. <verse eid="LUK 1:29" />
      <verse number="30" style="v" sid="LUK 1:30" />The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary; the fact is, you’ve found favor with God. <verse eid="LUK 1:30" />

    </para>
    <para style="p">
      <verse number="35" style="v" sid="LUK 1:35" />The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the miraculous power of the Most High will
        engulf you. For this reason, the one you’re giving birth to is holy, and he’ll be called a son of God.<verse eid="LUK 1:35" />
      <verse number="36" style="v" sid="LUK 1:36" />Take a look—in her old age, your relative Elizabeth—even she—is pregnant with a son; the one everyone

      <char style="fk">[A]</char>
      <char style="ft"><char style="it">many have attempted</char>…In these first few verses, Luke alludes to the fact that
        many have attempted to create a written record of the life of Jesus but did a mediocre job of it. He’s
        not referring to the Gnostic Gospels or some other heretical works, but to a few Christians who made
        early attempts to create what we now know as the Gospels but whose workmanship was a failure. Luke says
        here that he’ll correctly the problem and write his account accurately. Luke, the man of learning that
        he was, was versed in the correct method of writing history, the theory of which had been formulated
        by the first century. This passage gives us valuable insight into the formation of the four Gospels.
        None of the four were haphazardly written, all four gained the approval of the church leadership, and
        the “many” that Luke refers to in v.1 were rejected because they didn’t live up the standards set by
        the four that have been handed down through the ages. The four gospels were sponsored, by the church,
        approved by the church, and propagated by the church.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">To achieve the self-set goals Luke stated in vv3,4, in addition to fulfilling the requirements for writing
        proper history, Luke had to have conducted direct, meticulous interviews with the eyewitnesses of what
        he wrote about. From the content in the first few chapters of his Gospel, he certainly would’ve had to
        interview Mary mother or Jesus, or perhaps (and this is a stretch) one of Jesus’s siblings, at a minimum,
        the shepherds who were there at his birth, etc. Conducting these interviews and documenting them would’ve
        taken a few months, would’ve had to have taken place in Israel, and would’ve had to have taken place
        in the lifetime of all the witnesses. The timeframe which fits these criteria is Paul’s second and third
        missionary journeys, in particular his third, which was around A.D. 55. This would’ve been the latest
        date for the composition of Luke’s Gospel, as beyond that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’s birth would’ve
        died of old age.</char>

      <char style="fk">[B]</char>
      <char style="ft"><char style="it">Lord Theophilus</char>…Lit: <char style="it">Your Excellency Theophilus</char>. Luke
        addresses Theophilus like he’s an aristocrat or that he had authority over him or both. This evidence
        has led scholars to conjecture that Luke was either a freedman, once a slave to Theophilus, or perhaps
        still a slave. But Theophilus had assigned him to be an assistant to Paul, donating Luke to Paul’s ministry
        like someone would donate a car to a charity. This might explain why Luke was the only person still with
        Paul at the time of his death (2 Tim. 4:11)—he had no choice but to stick with him. In any event, slaves
        in ancient Rome were often educated, and Luke certainly was. In addition, the name Theophilus means God-friend.
        We’ll assume that his name’s not a coincidence, that he wasn’t born with the name but changed it or acquired
        it when he became a Christian. In any event, both his name and the interest he has in the events surrounding
        Jesus’s life indicate that he devoted his life to his faith.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">It might seem remarkable to us, living in modern times, that a slave or former slave such as Luke could
        write a great work of theology, humanity, and literature, but Epictetus, the Greek stoic philosopher,
        was born a slave. Two great books were written by his student-followers: <char style="it">Discourses</char>
        and <char style="it">Enchiridion</char>.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">who was of the priestly caste</char>…Lit: <char style="it">of the daughters of Aaron</char>.
        The priesthood was a hereditary caste consisting of males who descended from Aaron, brother of Moses,
        of the tribe of Levi. The priests were not required to marry women from within that caste. Luke goes
        out of his way to mention the fact that Elizabeth was in the Aaronic lineage even before giving her name.
        This emphasizes the purity of John the Baptist’s parents’ pedigree, the level of sanctity, consecration,
        and cleanness, the Old Testament prerequisites for holiness. These John inherited as a result. The extreme
        degree to which the couple were sanctified to God would only magnify the intensity of the view that God
        was punishing Zechariah and Elisabeth by not providing them with a son (v. 7), one who would propagate
        the priesthood on their behalf. As there was no sin that Zechariah and Elisabeth were culpable of, whereby
        they would’ve received God’s disfavor and reproach, it must’ve been a mystery to the people why God would
        not give them a son.</char>

        priests included entering the temple sanctuary on a regular basis to replenish the incense, which must

        in those days were split-level, and often the downstairs was used to house the animals. The upper room
        was the main domicile. This could mean that Mary and Joseph were staying at the lower level of a friend

        conjure up a miracle that would placate the angry mob, thus allowing him to walk away, but that’s not
        what happened. He had to exercise a measure of force and recalcitrance on his part to escape their clutches.
        The evidence in the GT is that, first, Luke uses an explicit personal pronoun for <char style="it">he</char>,
        which has connotations apart from the face-value meaning of the word <char style="it">he. </char>Luke
        is telling us something by choosing this pronoun; he’s telling us that Jesus himself was taking some
        action when leaving the mob. Second, Luke chooses the verb <char style="it">to go through </char>rather
        than <char style="it">to go out of</char>, the latter form being expected had no force been involved.
        <char style="it">Going through</char> emphasizes the opposition he faced, while <char style="it">going

        <char style="it">unclean</char>. In the GT, the noun <char style="it">spirit </char>is listed first followed
        by the adjectives<char style="it"> demonic unclean</char>. The adjective <char style="it">demonic </char>comes
        from the root verb <char style="it">daimonao </char>(δαιμονάω/no Strong’s number)<char style="it">, </char>which
        has the primary meaning <char style="it">to be subject to an avenging deity. Daimonao</char> is rooted
        in Greek mythology, where a person lost favor with one of the gods, and that god sent a lesser god or
        some other supernatural creature to torment said person. Also related to <char style="it">daimonao </char>is
        the Gk. verb <char style="it">daimonizomai </char><char style="w" strong="G01139">δαιμονίζομαι</char>)<char
        style="it">, </char>which has a primary definition <char style="it">to have an allotted fate. </char>In
        the case of <char style="it">daimonizomai, </char>it’s as though a god of mythology choose to use his
        or her supernatural power against a mortal being, and the person, being mortal, is trapped in the bonds
        of a superior, supernatural being, and therefore locked into the fate dictated by the god. Related to
        the use of these two words, Paul’s thorn in the flesh (2 Cor. 12:6–7) is actually that: a <char style="it">daimonion
        </char><char style="w" strong="G01140">δαιμόνιον</char>): a spirit assigned to him. Therefore, in a biblical
        context, the word <char style="it">demonic </char>means <char style="it">a being sent to torment or harass
        someone</char>. The other adjective, the word <char style="it">unclean, </char>is used throughout the
        OT for things forbidden by the Law of Moses to be touched, handled, things which are impure, unholy,
        and must be altogether shunned. These three words, <char style="it">spirit demonic unclean, </char>construct
        a different meaning to what was tormenting this man in the synagogue. First, <char style="it">spirit
        </char>means that it wasn’t a natural creature but a supernatural one. Second, <char style="it">demonic
        </char>means that the evil spirit is given a specific assignment to torment a person. Third, <char style="it">unclean
        </char>means that the spirit is all-around disgusting in its evil, irredeemably so.</char>

      <verse number="2" style="v" sid="LUK 5:2" />He saw two boats docked on the lake’s shore. Now the fishermen who manned these boats had disembarked
        and were scrubbing their fishing nets. <verse eid="LUK 5:2" />
      <verse number="3" style="v" sid="LUK 5:3" />But one of them—and this was Simon—was <char style="it">still </char>onboard one of the boats. He asked

        began to teach the crowd from the boat. <verse eid="LUK 5:3" />

      <verse number="7" style="v" sid="LUK 5:7" />They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come help<char style="it"> </char>haul the fish

      <verse number="8" style="v" sid="LUK 5:8" />Simon Peter, having witnessed this, fell to his knees before Jesus saying, “Leave me, sir, since I’m

      <verse number="9" style="v" sid="LUK 5:9" />You see, those surrounding him and all those who were a part of his company were amazed at the take of

      <verse number="10" style="v" sid="LUK 5:10" />In the same way, so were the sons of Zebedee, James and John, Simon’s coworkers. Jesus said to Simon,

      <verse number="13" style="v" sid="LUK 5:13" />He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, <char style="wj">“I do so desire: be purged.” </char>Immediately,
        the leprosy departed from him. <verse eid="LUK 5:13" />
      <verse number="14" style="v" sid="LUK 5:14" />He, though, told him sternly and in no uncertain terms to not tell anyone, but instead to go and show

        sense; once captured they continue to live. They are like prisoners of war in that their life changes:
        they are interned, they work in captivity, but are also cared for in captivity. Those who do the capturing
        must make provide for those captured; this is what Jesus is also hinting at—not only will Peter capture
        men, but he’ll have to have some sort of plan for them after they’re captured: a plan of discipleship.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">Plus, nobody while drinking the old wants the new; you see, he says, ‘The old stuff’s
        better.’”</char>…A few of the principal manuscripts have omitted v. 39, and one might speculate that
        this was done because the verse is awkward and enigmatic. Verse 39 describes a person who, while in the
        act of drinking the older wine, claims that he prefers the older to the newer, without giving due consideration
        to the new. While drinking the old, his heightened awareness of its subtle, unique flavor causes him
        to lose any objectivity to the different qualities that the new will possess. His fondness for the wine
        at the moment produces a reaction which rejects any substitute—even to his detriment, as he may thoroughly
        enjoy the new wine also, were he to just give it a chance.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">And it reminds me of an old company in the landscape of corporate America which has an excellent product—be
        it an aircraft, a soft drink, what have you—and management in their hubris (or under pressure from the
        stockholders) thinks they can tinker with it and either to improve it or to shave a few pennies off its
        cost. But the old product is better. Or, don’t you miss the way they built such-and-such a few decades
        ago?—You have to pay top dollar on the used market to get one, because they’re not made anymore.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">These analogies are relevant to this passage. There were movements of God going on at the time, one of
        austerity (John the Baptist) and one of celebration (Jesus). Both are very different from one another.
        When one is caught up in the one, he becomes so enthralled with it that he will not see the value in
        the other. Jesus says that both are necessary and that there’s a time and place for both. Another application
        is that the old-timers had a more powerful presence of the Holy Spirit in their services than we do today.</char>

        first learn from other Scriptures what it is not. It is not taking no account of what others do (one
        example: “Know them which labor among you,” 1 Thess. 5:12). In the NT, if someone who claimed to be a
        Christian conducted himself in an immoral manner, this person was to be treated like an infidel. But
        ascertaining such behavior is not judging. Judging is drawing conclusions, based on a person’s history,
        concluding what their fate or destiny must be. Condemning a person is determining that a person who has
        guilt due to sin will never be able to escape it, that part or all of their life is irredeemable—Even
        though it may in fact be irredeemable. To judge someone is to weigh them by their motives and not by
        their actions. To condemn someone is to assign them consequences. Concerning judging, ref. note of Matt.

        centurion was a Gentile and that the Jews were not supposed to have any contact with the Gentiles—certainly

        my servant be healed</char>. The principle manuscripts diverge on this. The other principles instead
        say, <char style="it">and</char> <char style="it">my servant will be healed</char>. The former, <char
        style="it">and grant that my servant be healed, </char>is the reading chosen by the UBS NT, the correct
        choice. The UBS choice is consistent with and confirmed by the centurion’s statement in verse 8 which
        says,<char style="it"> I say to this one, have him come, and he comes</char>. The verb tense used in
        both <char style="it">grant that my servant be healed</char> (for <char style="it">grant…be healed</char>)<char
        style="it"> </char>and <char style="it">I say to this one, have him go forth, and he goes </char>(for
        <char style="it">have him go</char>) are both 3<char style="sup">rd</char> person imperatives. The meaning
        in the 3<char style="sup">rd</char> person imperative of <char style="it">have him come </char>is more
        clear: the centurion is giving an order to a third party, the order being for the third party to relay
        another order to the person, the one who’s being summoned. What the centurion wants is for Jesus to relay
        a command through a third party (his friends), instead of Jesus giving a person-to-person order without
        the third party relay. This is the way that chain-of-command-structured authority hierarchies work; you
        can give a command to a subordinate who will in turn pass the command down the chain of subordinates.
        The centurion’s faith caused him to recognize that the kingdom of God must also be a chain-of-command-structured
        authority hierarchy, or else if wouldn’t function.</char>

        style="it"> Satan fall from heaven like lightning</char>. Luke 10:18 is one of the most misinterpreted
        verses in the NT. It is commonly understood to be Satan being cast out of heaven prior to the creation
        of man (ref. Is. 14:12; Ez. 28:16; Rev. 12:7–9). This is not the case. Instead, Jesus is seeing in the
        spiritual world (ref. “discerning of spirits”, 1 Cor. 12:10) what the seventy-two who had been sent out
        were doing in the natural world. Jesus was watching in real time; each time they cast out a demon, he
        saw a lightning strike.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">The elements to the correct interpretation of this passage, first, is that the word translated <char
        style="it">was watching </char>is in the Gk. imperfect tense. In this case, it insinuates multiple, repeated
        action, not a single action; plus it insinuates Jesus watching something unfold in real-time (in other
        words, watching concurrently as the disciples were doing it). Second, the Gk. word for <char style="it">heaven
        </char>(<char style="it">ouranos</char>/οὐρανός/Strong’s 3772) can mean either the sky (Acts 1:1), heaven
        itself (Luke 10:14), the spiritual world around us (1 Cor. 12:2; Eph. 6:12), or a place of spiritual
        dominion. In the case of Luke 10:18, <char style="it">ouranos </char>means the third: a place of spiritual
        dominion. Third, the word <char style="it">Satan </char>is used as a synecdoche/metonymy for the word
        <char style="it">demon</char> (also in Matt. 12:26; Luke 13:16). Fourth, the word <char style="it">fall
        </char>refers to somebody or something losing its authority or dominion, usually by force (Rev. 18:2;
        Rev. 12:7–9).</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">The correct interpretation of Jesus seeing multiple demons get cast down in real-time is relevant to
        the enclosing context. In other words, Jesus sent the disciples out, and in v. 17 they come back rejoicing,
        telling what had happened. Jesus regurgitating something which happened thousands of years before would
        be irrelevant and incongruous to the remark his disciples just made.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">legitimately claim and lay hold of</char>…Lit: <char style="it">inherit</char>. To <char
        style="it">inherit</char> or <char style="it">the inheritance</char> or simply <char style="it">possess
        </char>refer to the same biblical concept. The concept of the inheritance is that God has a specific
        place He has reserved for you, that you have claim to, and He promises to bring you to it (inheriting)
        and to keep you in it (salvation), and to restore you to it should you lose it (redemption). The concept
        of the inheritance starts in the OT with God promising Abraham a land, not only to him but to his descendants,
        and this land is eventually subdivided into continuously smaller pieces, down to individual, single-family
        lots. Such subdividing of the land is enumerated in Joshua chapters 13–22. Though the concept of the
        inheritance begins with God communicating to His man, His tribe, His people that He has promised them
        a portion of land, it then extends into the journey to get to that land and to the obedience required
        to take possession of that land. Some examples: Ps. 37:9,29; Prov. 10:30; Is. 14:21; Is. 57:13; 60:21).
        The concept is applicable beyond land to anything God promises a believer to have, which in the case
        of v. 25 refers to eternal life.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">eternal life</char>…This phrase is used throughout the NT, particularly in the Gospel
        of John. From the face-value meaning of the words, <char style="it">eternal life </char>would appear
        to mean life after death, but there are a couple of problems with that interpretation. First, the OT,
        and by extension Judaism, emphasizes the here-and-now and de-emphasizes life after death, to the point
        where some Jews (the Sadducees) didn’t even believe in life after death. Second, Jesus said in v. 28,
        “Do this and you shall live.” He’s talking about the here-and-now, not the life to come. This leaves
        the unanswered question: what exactly does the NT mean by the phrase <char style="it">eternal life</char>?
        The answer comes from reading all the passages that talk about eternal life, reading them with an understanding
        that it’s talking about the here-and-now, not life after death, and meditating on the evidence. The answer
        will then present itself.</char>

        The rendering of the accepted GT reads, <char style="it">the from-heaven-Father will give</char>; the

        Spirit </char>occur in forms throughout the NT in both using and not using the definite article, in this
        context the omission of the definite article indicates the nature of the gift which the Father is giving,
        that the nature of the gift is good and never bad, and that if He’s giving the gift of a spirit, you
        can rest assured that it is none other than the Holy Spirit.</char>

        could give to this question is that their protégés don’t rely on anyone’s help to cast out demons, because
        they do not nor ever will cast out demons. They’re questioning where Jesus is getting the ability to
        cast out demons; Jesus is asking why they don’t have any ability to cast out demons. Jesus goes on to
        say that whatever the answer to this question happens to be will decide whether he (Jesus) is getting
        help from God or from Beelzebub.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">a man who’s armed to the hilt</char>…Lit: <char style="it">the fully-armed strong man</char>.
        The GT says <char style="it">the strong man </char>instead of <char style="it">a strong man</char> in
        the same way that John 10:10 reads, <char style="it">the thief </char>(both are a figure of speech).
        Also, the GT emphasizes the fact that the man is wearing armor, as v. 22 literally reads, <char style="it">he
        takes away the armor upon which he had relied, </char>instead of,<char style="it"> he takes away the
        weapons and armor upon which he had relied</char>. It is the armor which turns the man a strong man,
        more so than the weapon he wields. His armor (and presumably a weapon to go along with it) makes him
        nearly invincible against someone who’s simply armed but is wearing no armor.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">avarice</char>…Lit: the Gk. word <char style="it">harpagay </char><char style="w" strong="G00724">ἁρπαγή</char>).
        This word refers to a physical item: a hook used to draw a bucket out of a well or a garden rake of some
        sort, something used to gather brush. In both cases, the purpose of the physical object is that of gathering
        and pulling something in. In the context of this passage here in Luke, and perhaps for most usages, <char
        style="it">harpagay </char>is the pulling in of non-material things, immorally so. It applies not only
        to wealth but to fame and to other things. Therefore, <char style="it">harpagay</char> can alternately
        be translated <char style="it">covetousness</char>, <char style="it">greed</char>, or <char style="it">rapacity</char>.
        In addition to the word <char style="it">harpagay, </char>the Gk. word in the NT more frequently rendered
        <char style="it">covetousness</char> or <char style="it">greed</char> is <char style="it">pleonexia </char><char
        style="w" strong="G04124">πλεονεξία</char>), which is from the root word <char style="it">pleon </char><char
        style="w" strong="G04119">πλείων</char>), which means “too much.” <char style="it">Pleonexia</char> is
        defined as, “a disposition to take more than one’s share”; in addition to meaning covetousness and greed,
        <char style="it">pleonexia</char> can also mean, “something one feels forced to do.” <char style="it">Pleonexia</char>
        is the compulsion to gather an inordinate amount of material goods; <char style="it">harpagay</char>
        is the gathering of such things, or the gathering of fame and the like. The word used in 1 Tim. 3:3 for
        “not covetous” is <char style="it">aphilarguros </char><char style="w" strong="G00866">ἀφιλάργυρος</char>),
        which broken down from its concatenated roots is, <char style="it">not-a-comradely-love-of-silver</char>.
        Since <char style="it">silver</char> means <char style="it">money</char>, it is better rendered<char

        things, alms</char> appears to be an expression or perhaps even an idiom, and its meaning is inferred
        from the context. It’s assumed that this phrase is a metaphor that compares the purging of what’s on
        the inside to someone giving alms.</char>

        audience with the king, had an audience with his entire court and not just with the king alone. Often,
        matters submitted to the king were submitted to the entire court, with the king presiding over it, and
        the court would vet and argue the matter for the benefit of the king, with the King presiding over the
        interrogation and giving his final word at the end. Jesus saying that he’ll confess or deny a person

      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">1. The appearance of the definite article (<char style="it">to</char>) precludes this phrase from being

      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">3. The use of the adjective <char style="it">micron </char>is somewhat redundant considering that <char

      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">4. Preceded by the definite article, the adjective is attributive and not predicative, which makes it
        more likely to be an expression.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">3. The use of the definite article means that Luke is referring to something specific.</char>

        insinuate a few things. First, this tense is more emphatic than the default tense (the present). Second,
        it implies a one-time action. The one-time action of selling and giving doesn’t mean that there won’t
        be subsequent times in which this must be done, but it means that one doesn’t have to sell one’s belongings
        every time one accumulates belongings. Jesus is being emphatic to get them to break a mindset of hoarding
        possessions, hoarding them for fear of not having enough in a time of need.</char>

        <char style="it">I have a baptism to be baptized </char>[<char style="it">in</char>]. This verse (Luke
        12:50), along with 1 Cor. 10:2 and with the accounts of John the Baptist, shed light on what the word
        <char style="it">baptism </char>means in the Bible, and consequently what it is for a Christian to be
        baptized. In Luke 12:50, the baptism Jesus is referring to is his death and resurrection. In 1 Cor. 10:2,
        the nation of Israel was baptized into Moses by the cloud and the sea. And John the Baptist’s baptism
        was one of repentance. These passages on baptism reveal the following: Baptism is a totally transformative
        event. A person’s post-baptism life is changed entirely with respect to his pre-baptism life. The person
        being baptized enters into a binding contract, a covenant, of some sort. In order to undergo the transformation
        associated with baptism, the person being baptized must surrender his life to the transformation. After
        the baptism, the covenant which the person entered into is subject to terms, terms not only for the one
        baptized but also for God. God commits Himself to terms which consists of promises, and though a person
        is bound by the terms of the covenant, on the other hand he benefits from the terms God commits to, acquiring
        the promises. This baptism-covenant pattern summarizes Christianity: a total commitment by the one being
        baptized to the terms of the covenant (God’s commandments); access through faith to the promises of God
        (found in the Bible) which protects one from the depravations of life.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">And now why do you also not decide amongst yourselves what’s the right thing to do about
        a dispute…</char>In this parable, Jesus tells his followers that each person should objectively consider
        both sides of a dispute he’s embroiled in, and determine if his opponent’s case is stronger than his
        own. Jesus is teaching them to impartially weigh the merits of both sides of the case. He repeats this
        point in a different parable in Luke 14:31. But in addition to objectively considering both sides to
        an argument, what Jesus says in vv. 57–59 is that once you weigh both sides of a dispute, you’ll find
        that your case is in fact the weaker of the two, and that being the situation, it would behoove you to
        settle the dispute between just the two of you and not let it go before a judge and have him settle it
        instead. This parable has several applications, the first application is that one is better “settling
        out of court” and receiving the remission of sins offered by Christ and not attempting to prove one’s
        own righteousness based on works in a courtroom before God, where the verdict will be against you. Another
        application is walking in the Spirit rather than walking in your plain self. If you weight the evidence,
        you’ll find that plain-self, as it turns out, is dominated by the carnal nature, and as such cannot fulfill
        the lofty requirements of the Christian life. Christians should recognize that living their life apart
        from the indwelling Spirit is a losing proposition and should seek to redress the problem as soon as
        possible.</char>

        modern times, if one couldn’t pay the fine or penalty meted out by a court settlement, then that person
        was thrown in prison (debtors’ prison) until he could pay. The problem, of course, is that once in prison,
        the debtor is no longer free to earn money to pay the fine or penalty requisite to get out of prison.
        Unless someone else pays it or they cut you a break on the settlement terms, you’re stuck. And this is
        the point Jesus makes in v. 59: once thrown in prison, you’ll get not breaks on the settlements and you’ll
        ever get out.</char>

        </char>(<char style="it">pothen</char>, πόθεν/Strong’s 4159). This expression also appears in John 7:27–28
        (three times); John 8:14 (somewhat); John 9:29–30; John 19:9. The expression roughly corresponds to the
        English, <char style="it">where are you coming from? </char>Alternately, it may mean, <char style="it">what
        are you all about?</char>; w<char style="it">hat’s your driving motivation?; what makes you tick?; what’s
        your raison d’être?; I don’t know if you’re on the level; you’re a wacko. </char>On another note, this
        phrase is repeated in v. 27. The principle manuscripts differ in the reading. The accepted reading is
        lit. <char style="it">I don’t know you, whence you are</char>; but other principal manuscripts read <char
        style="it">I don’t know whence you are. </char>The latter is a shortened version of a well-known expression,
        readily understood and registered as such by the hearer because of the conspicuousness of the word <char

        the suggestion is to not put the salt in the ground or the compost pile (lit: <char style="it">manure
        pile</char>). Even if salt did lose its potency, it’s still salt, and as salt it will poison any ground
        or compost it’s applied to. One will never put actual salt in the ground or in a compost pile. There
        must be more to the story here.</char>

        Also, the word <char style="it">tents</char> is a Semitic figure of speech used in the OT (like in 1
        Kings 12:16) which uses words from the bygone-days of Israel that were bygone in Jesus’s time, as it
        hearkens back to the days before they were a nation but were nomads, like in the time of Abraham, still

        is a continuation of the parable of the steward.</char>

        The word for <char style="it">suffers violence</char> is an idiom; though the exact meaning is not entirely
        certain, it seems to mean that a person has to make difficult decisions to the point of undergoing hardships,
        of acting decisively, of exercising his willpower to the uttermost extent, and of challenging his most
        fundamental and sacred beliefs. Ref. Matt. 11:12.</char>

        in so-and-so’s lap while he’s reclined at the dinner table. Lazarus is reclined in such a way that his
        head is in Abraham’s lap, as John was in Jesus’s in John 13:23. “Abraham’s bosom” is a metaphor of close
        friendship, as the one who lies for a meal and places his head in another’s bosom is best of friends.</char>

        of mythology who’s god of the underworld. It is also a synecdoche for the underworld itself, the place
        where people go after they die. The writers of the NT used the word <char style="it">Hades </char>in
        an abstract manner; in other words, they used it to refer to the place people go when they die. However,
        just because the NT uses the word Hades doesn’t mean that it concurs with all of what the Greeks thought
        of the underworld. It is simply the place where the dead go. As can be seen in this story, it consists
        of the place where both the good and the bad go after they die.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">send Lazarus</char>…There is evidence that Lazarus was at one time the rich man’s servant:
        first, because the rich man recognized Lazarus at a distance; second, because he knew his name; third,
        the fact that Lazarus was stationed at his front gate, not far from where he had once lived; fourth,
        that the rich man is asking for service from Lazarus, something he was accustomed to doing while alive.
        As it appears, when Lazarus became too old or too frail to perform his duties, the rich man tossed him
        out on the street, where he had to beg for the remainder of his life. The rich man’s wealth and lavish
        lifestyle wasn’t directly responsible for his punishment in the afterlife, but the wealth and deceitful
        lifestyle fueled a disdain for his fellow man, and that ultimately is what landed him in hell. There
        are commandments in the Old Testament for showing kindness to the less-fortunate; the rich man disobeyed
        these.</char>

        word-for-word in English while retaining the succinctness that a chant requires. A chant is as much about
        rhythm as it is about the actual words. I surmise that since this was a chant, and since chants aren’t
        necessarily written in the same logical fashion as narratives are, this is one of the causes (though
        not the only one) for the disagreement in the principal manuscripts as to the precise wording of this

        style="it">That’ll work</char>…Lit<char style="it">: it is enough</char>. Some ambiguity, as Jesus could
        be taken to mean “enough of this nonsense” or “that’ll be enough swords.” The former is assumed to be
        correct, as it is connected to what Jesus said in v. 36: “have him sell his jacket [lit: cloak] and have
        him buy a sword.” What Jesus meant by this statement of v. 36 is that you’ll no longer need your cloak.
        Everyone owned a cloak, and most people owned just one, and it was used as a blanket at night—which would
        be your only blanket too. In the long-term, a cloak was an essential need of life, but in the short-term
        is not a necessity, like when one is engaged in moderate physical activity, since the body generates
        enough heat to keep oneself warm without needing a cloak for warmth. The cloak becomes necessary after
        the activity, of course. The sword refers to going to a war. Together, what v. 36 means is for you to
        get rid of your cloak since you won’t be needing it anymore, but acquire a sword in its place, since
        you will be needing that: You’re going to war and you’ll probably be killed. Jesus didn’t literally mean
        to buy a sword and go off to battle; his meaning was figurative. But the twelve didn’t see it as figurative,
        taking the statement literally. Jesus didn’t have enough time to explain himself, so he simply dropped
        the subject by saying “just forget it, ok.”</char>

      <char style="ft">Verses 43 and 44 are not found in some of the most important manuscripts (KJV: “43And there appeared
        an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and
        his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”)This passage has always been
        controversial, and that because of its content. Verse 43 has the same spurious feel to it as John 5:4,
        and verse 44 has been debated for centuries (see next note).</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">his sweat happened to drip on the ground like when drops of blood from a cut drip on
        the ground</char>…Jesus didn’t actually sweat drops of blood; this is a simile. The rate at which his
        drops of sweat dripped onto the ground is compared to the rate at which, say for example, you cut your
        finger with a knife—the rate at which that cut bleeds. That’s a high rate of perspiration, one which
        occurs when a person is engaged in highly strenuous exercise, usually complicated by warmer temperatures.
        The fact that Jesus wasn’t physically moving and that it was chilly enough later in the night for Peter
        to have to warm himself around a fire makes this extraordinary. On the other hand, there’s dubious (at
        best) scientific evidence to back up the claim that people under extreme duress sweat blood. It simply
        does not happen. So if Jesus did actually sweat drops of blood, as many assert, that removes that experience
        of prayer out of the realm of human experience and into the super-human, even supernatural, and in this
        instance would have exempted him from suffering as an ordinary human being.</char>

        The answer to Jesus’s question, <char style="it">what happened to the dried-out pieces, </char>is that
        the dried-out pieces are already in use with bodies still hung on them being crucified. As a result,
        there are no more pieces of wood lying around which can be used to crucify everyone who’s about to be
        crucified. The Romans crucified criminals on a regular basis, and undoubtedly reused the same crosses
        over and over, keeping them in a back room or a warehouse, as this would be easier than finding wood
        and building a cross each time a criminal needed to be crucified. So they kept enough crosses in storage
        to handle the day-to-day crucifixions, and these crosses are the “dried-out<char style="it"> </char>pieces”<char
        style="it"> </char>referred to in this verse. However, there were instances when the Romans performed
        mass-crucifixions, and the fall of Jerusalem in 70AD would be one such instance. In that case, they wouldn’t
        have been enough crosses in storage to perform all the crucifixions, as the roads would be lined for
        miles with those crucified. In that case, they’d have to cut down trees to get the lumber needed for
        all the crucifixions, hence the “pieces of freshly-cut lumber.”</char>
