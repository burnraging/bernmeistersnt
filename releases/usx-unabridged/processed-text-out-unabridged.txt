  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  MATT Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |According to church history, Matthew was the first of the four gospels to be written. Apparently, it|
                                        |was commissioned by the Jewish church, those Jews who came to believe in Jesus as the Messiah and continued|
                                        |to hold to their Jewish ways. For this reason it is steeped in Judaism and assumes the reader is familiar|
                                        |with the Judaism of the Old Testament.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Matthew, one of the twelve apostles, was a logical choice to write this book since he was an eyewitness|
                                        |to most of Jesus’s ministry, which is the majority of the book. It’s assumed that the parts in which|
                                        |he wasn’t an eye-witness, he interviewed those who lived in Israel who were themselves eyewitnesses of|
                                        |John’s ministry, etc.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Church history also says that Matthew was originally written in Hebrew then translated into Gk. The GT|
                                        |has a simplistic and awkward feeling, the same sort you get when you follow subtitles of a foreign movie.|
                                        |It is apparent in the GT that Matthew was not a native Greek speaker. He does not have the command of|
                                        |the language which Paul and Luke have. But one thing is clear: an extensive amount of research went into|
                                        |the Gospel of Matthew.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But Matthew is rich in figures of speech, rich in symbolism, and has a Semitic feel to it. This gives|
                                        |it a uniqueness among the NT books. The figures of speech have a richness which is difficult to follow|
                                        |for those not intimately familiar with the Bible and those who can’t see the figures of speech beneath|
                                        |the literal words. The more literal translations, the KJV in particular, preserve the colorful language|
                                        |at the expense of being more difficult to comprehend. In order to make it more comprehensible, much of|
                                        |the rich language has to be abandoned, which is a pity. To complicate matters, Matthew quotes Jesus saying|
                                        |things that cause one to stop and scratch his head for a while.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |So that these treasures of literature don’t completely fall through the cracks of translation, copious|
                                        |footnotes supplement the rendered text to point to the original, beautiful language. In addition, because|
                                        |Matthew is such a lively book, it merits a more lively translation. If one looks through all the layers|
                                        |of translations, simplicity of language, myriads of OT references, one sees that Jesus was a colorful|
                                        |speaker, much like those simple ministers who can break a congregation out into laughter and a moment|
                                        |later bring them to tears. Of interest, also, is that there are a couple of parables which are told like|
                                        |an ordinary story, no surprises. An interesting story, but one which, part way through, ceases to be|
                                        |an ordinary story and goes off the rail into something bizarre. Examples are the parable of the wheat|
                                        |and the tares (Matth. 13), parable of the vineyard day-laborers (Matt. 20). |

                                        |is important as Matthew was written for a Jewish audience. It’s to show that Jesus fulfills the promises|

                                        |to us today was important in OT times. It shows the mercy of God and providence of God as Jesus descended|

                                        |the case of the husband is treated differently than the case of the wife, as the husband was permitted|
                                        |by law to initiate a marriage and to initiate a divorce. The wife could only ascent to it or acquiesce|
                                        |to it. Therefore, their situations are different, and Jesus speaks to both separately. In modern times,|
                                        |we would simply say, <char style="it">whoever gets a divorce and remarries (except in the case of sexual|

                                        |an eye and a tooth for a tooth” was OT law; the same was also embedded in Hammurabi’s law code. If someone|
                                        |wrongs you, you have the legal right of retaliation, the right to get even. For mankind, this is natural|
                                        |law; “turning the other cheek” is therefore a point of contention for many. A couple things to consider.|
                                        |First, the point Jesus was making is that you don’t have to retaliate when you’re wronged. He didn’t|
                                        |mean that you shouldn’t protect yourself against those who try to harm you. Second, read Acts 23:1-10,|
                                        |where Paul was actually slapped on the cheek, and ask yourself, “Did Paul turn the other cheek?” Same|
                                        |thing for Acts 16:37: when Paul, a Roman citizen, had been illegally beaten, he demanded his rights.|
                                        |Also see Acts 22:25.|
     M                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Turning the other cheek is to present the same “face”—the same disposition—which you presented previously.|
                                        |Don’t change your disposition based on the way people treat you. For example, an employee is working|
                                        |at a retailer. While the employee is politely explaining a company policy, the customer behaves rudely.|
                                        |The employee turns the cheek when he continues to show politeness after the customer behaves badly. An|
                                        |example of turning the other cheek is when Joseph decided to divorce Mary (Matt. 1:19): he chose to do|
                                        |it quietly rather than to retaliate by making a stink about it.|
     M                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Turning the other cheek is not as extreme and uncommon as it appears. In fact, even non-Christians turn|
                                        |the other cheek from time to time. Waitresses who are treated rudely by their customers but continue|

                                        |it to mean that Christians should refrain from ascertaining guilt or innocence, i.e. they shouldn’t decide|
                                        |whether another person’s deeds are moral or immoral, and to make such decisions brings judgment upon|
                                        |ourselves. Not only does this contradict common sense but it’s not consistent with other teaching of|
                                        |the NT. It’s the case of building a doctrine on one verse of Scripture and not taking all of Scripture|
                                        |into consideration. Those who wrote the NT lived in the times of Jesus and were either spent much time|
                                        |around him (and conversed in the same native language), were taught directly by him, or had contact with|
                                        |those who did. Had Jesus meant that Christians shouldn’t ascertain moral guilt or innocence of others,|
                                        |then their writers would reflect that. But their writings do not. In other words, Paul’s epistles violate|
                                        |the notion that “don’t judge” means one shouldn’t look at another Christian and decide if what they’re|
                                        |doing is right or wrong. For example, Paul wrote these statements in 1 Cor. 5, <char style="it">For I|
                                        |verily as absent in body but present in spirit, hath judged already, as though I were present, concerning|

                                        |extended to spiritual conditions. But in this passage, the leper must be certified (the certification|

                                        |etc. In the Bible the phrase <char style="it">son of</char> means someone who’s a perfect example, who|

                                        |being. <char style="it">Son of man</char> means several things. It means the perfect man; one who has|
                                        |the full spectrum of human qualities alive and fully functioning in himself; a sort of Renaissance man;|
                                        |a single specimen who’s the most suitable representative for the human race; a person who stands in proxy|
                                        |for all human beings; a person of character and ability; and in this context, the Man. All these describe|

     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">bury my father…</char>this<char style="it"> </char>is likely an expression and a hyperbole,|

                                        |applicable in NT times as well. If <char style="it">bury my father </char>is an expression indeed, then|
                                        |Jesus’s reply <char style="it">Let the dead bury their own dead </char>is a play on that expression.|
                                        |The “dead” Jesus refers to are the spiritually dead; the expression therefore means, “Let the spiritually|

                                        |word <char style="it">receive </char>used here refers to those who take in and shelter such a prophet,|
                                        |provide him with meals while he’s stays with them, and clothe him, if necessary. These gifts of food,|
                                        |shelter, and clothing are the prophet’s “wages” referred to in this passage. What it means to receive|
                                        |a prophet in the name of a prophet is to welcome and support that prophet simply out of respect for his|
                                        |calling and his ministry and not because of his charisma, his personality, a personal like or dislike|

                                        |back a “prophet’s wage”: a payback blessing from God in the form of material goods in this lifetime and,|
                                        |in addition, of spiritual rewards in the life to come. |

                                        |style="it">miracles of the season</char>. God performed different kinds of miracles depending on what|
                                        |was needed at the time. Elijah’s miracles were the send-down-fire-from-the-sky type. God performed those|
                                        |kinds of miracles in Elijah’s time (i.e., Elijah’s season or Elijah’s dispensation) because that was|
                                        |what was needed or appropriate for that season. God was performing through Jesus mostly healing miracles,|
                                        |as the season had changed from that of Elijah’s to a season of the mercy of God. The miracles in Jesus’s|
                                        |ministry were of a different nature than Elijah’s, but the Pharisees expected Jesus to vindicate himself|
                                        |through Elijah-type miracles. The Pharisees were demanding a miracle that was relevant to Elijah’s dispensation|
                                        |and would not recognize a miracle which was relevant to Jesus’s dispensation. They could look at the|
                                        |sky, noting the time of day and the weather season, and know what kind of weather to expect, but could|
                                        |not differentiate what miracle was appropriate for the time they lived in.|

                                        |back from the dead as he said he would. Jesus is saying that he won’t do any miracle on-demand except|
                                        |for that singular miracle of coming back from the dead. In reality, Jesus did miracles all the time,|
                                        |and the Pharisees could have just followed him around and saw one, but the Pharisees wouldn’t accept|

     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">you don’t have any bread?…</char>Jesus reprimands them because all they’re caught up|
                                        |in thinking about where they’re going to find food. That should have faith that God will provide them|
                                        |food and look to the kingdom of heaven.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">how many basketfuls you picked up…</char>The account of the leftover baskets here in|
                                        |vv. 9, 10 is repeated Mark 9:17. The lesson is the same: in both miracles of multiplication, the disciples|
                                        |finished with the same number of baskets as when they started. For that matter, had they fed more, they|
                                        |still would have finished with the same number of baskets as they started. The food was not multiplied|
                                        |when Jesus gave thanks before the meal. Jesus did not pray and a heap of food appeared. Instead, the|
                                        |miracle occurred each time a disciple reached his hand into a basket to hand out more food. The food|
                                        |was multiplied on-the-spot over and over again, as many times as was needed. The point Jesus makes is|
                                        |that God’s provision for our daily bread happens on-the-spot, right when it’s needed, as many times as|

                                        |say that petros is a different word than petra, that petros means a rock fragment, that while Peter is|

                                        |the result, but nevertheless, an attempt is made. As it was in ancient times, so it was up until the|
                                        |last century or so, than coins were tethered to their intrinsic value in gold or silver. The average|
                                        |biblical commentator did simple conversions based on the value of silver. But this does not give meaningful|
                                        |results, as the leaps in industrial productivity have made silver relatively plentiful compared to ancient|
                                        |times. The cost of silver in today’s US dollars is around $0.76/gram—but that in no way reflects the|
                                        |purchasing power of silver today verses silver in ancient times. A more accurate method for conversion|
                                        |is to base it on the cost of unskilled labor. Even that varies enormously between industrialized nations|
                                        |and non-industrialized nations. The cost of labor in ancient times can be ascertained from Matt. 20:2,|
                                        |which is namely 1 denarius (4g silver) per day. In US in the 19<char style="sup">th</char> century, a|
                                        |day’s labor went for around $0.80, which was around 18g of silver, or 4.5 times more silver per day than|
                                        |what a worker in ancient times received—which demonstrates the inadequacy of simple conversions based|
                                        |on the price of gold or silver. But if one assumes that an unskilled worker makes $12/hour nowadays in|
                                        |industrialized nations, and therefore is paid $100 per day, then a denarius would represent $100 in today’s|
                                        |purchasing power. Of course, in contemporary, non-industrialized nations, the price of labor per day|
                                        |might be $5–$10, which is substantially less than industrialized nations. So the 100 denarrii equate|
                                        |to $10,000 of purchasing power in industrialized nations, but only $500 in non-industrialized nations.|

                                        |one’s standing before God. One who is clothed properly has right standing before God. This is what Jesus|
                                        |is referring to here. There is a righteousness that man attempts on his own and a righteousness which|
                                        |God provides. Man’s righteousness is his own clothing, and, in this parable, his own clothing is not|
                                        |the proper attire for a wedding. The only attire which is proper for a wedding is that which God provides,|
                                        |His wedding outfit. The bad folk in v.10 who were invited were given the proper clothing to wear, meaning|
                                        |that they received a righteousness given by God, and therefore were not thrown out of the wedding.|

                                        |are the called, few are the chosen</char>. From the repetition of words in this passage, it’s clear that|
                                        |Jesus in this verse is referring to the ones who have been invited to the wedding. In other words, the|

                                        |refers to those who in v.8 qualify (are worthy). Jesus is saying that many are invited to the wedding|
                                        |but only a few show up and are dressed properly when they do. In that light, God is not arbitrarily choosing|
                                        |a few out of the many, but lays down simple, easy requirements that only a few will comply with.|

                                        |reads scrolls out loud to the congregation during church services; those in the congregation did not|
                                        |read scrolls themselves, even at home. Matthew’s note here is given to the deacon, with the intention|
                                        |that the deacon read this note to himself ahead of time before the Scripture reading in front of the|
                                        |congregation, and do some research on what the abomination of desolation is, to refresh himself on Daniel’s|
                                        |prophecies, and complete this research before the reading. Then the deacon, when he reached this verse|
                                        |while reading to the congregation, would pause reading the scroll and explain to the congregation in|

                                        |roofs as porches. What Jesus is saying is to take the quick way down off the roof of the house, which|
                                        |is the ladder on the outside of the house, rather than the slower way down, which is the stairs or ladders|
                                        |on the inside of the house, and while going through the house pick up some belongings. This is a figure|
                                        |of speech, akin to a hyperbole. In reality, those warned to flee would have two minutes or so—but only|
                                        |two minutes—to gather some belongings for the road, get the kids, unhitch the donkey, and get out of|

                                        |can’t march easily. Women with infants (breastfeeding women) will have difficulty because there’ll be|
                                        |a limited amount of food to eat compounded by the calories burned while travelling at a fast clip. Such|
                                        |women won’t be able to produce as much milk in these conditions. Furthermore, children who are still|
                                        |breastfeeding likely are still in diapers, and infants are more difficult to carry around on a backpack|
                                        |too, or the like. But it seems that Jesus is using examples of women in a figure of speech, to represent|

                                        |either the winter time or on Sabbaths and holidays be difficult? The likely answer is that during both|
                                        |of these times, there’s no previously stored food available which can be taken in a hurry for the trip|

                                        |was, is a place of self-denial, of fasting, of repentance. The bedroom (closet) is a place of prayer.|

                                        |to these holy days as well. This meant that no work could be done on the Passover, being a Sabbath. Therefore,|

******************  MARK   **************

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  MARK Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |According to church tradition, Mark is the one referred to as John-Mark, son of Mary, in Acts 15:37,|
                                        |to whose house Peter went after the angel freed him from the prison in Jerusalem. John-Mark is also the|
                                        |cousin of Barnabas. Some believe that his mother Mary is the one who furnished the upper room used for|
                                        |the Last Supper and also used on the day of Pentecost. Some believe that the “young man” whom Mark refers|
                                        |to in Mark 14:51,52 is none other than himself, corroborating the theories. But most agree that the “Mark|
                                        |my son” whom Peter refers to in 1 Pet. 5:13 is the same John-Mark and is the author of the Gospel of|
                                        |Mark.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Mark was not actually Peter’s son, but he was a close enough companion and brother that Peter claims|
                                        |him as his figurative son, not only a son in the faith but a son in relation. Church tradition says that|
                                        |Mark was Peter’s interpreter, likely interpreting Aramaic into Greek as Peter itinerated throughout the|
                                        |Roman Empire. Serving as Peter’s interpreter, Mark would re-tell the same stories over and over again.|
                                        |He also spent a lot of time with Peter, everything from travelling to dining. No doubt, Mark spoke to|
                                        |Peter a lot and asked many questions about the missing details of the life of Jesus.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Also according to church tradition, Peter was martyred in Rome. Mark was there at that time, and the|
                                        |brethren asked him to commit all of what Peter had told him over the years to a book. This book is the|
                                        |Gospel of Mark. Mark’s gospel is written to a Roman audience, so it does not dwell on things that would|
                                        |be interesting to a Jewish believer of the day who believed in the Messiah. Mark’s gospel is full of|
                                        |drama, action, encounters, confrontation. The teachings it contains are more down-to-earth than Matthew|
                                        |or Luke, though they are wrapped in analogy (parable) as Jesus taught them.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Mark’s Greek is simple. He does not have the command of the language that Luke and Paul do, and his Gospel|
                                        |makes repeated use of simple words rather than drawing on less common, more specific words. There’s rich|
                                        |detail in the description of characters that looks like it came straight from the mouth of Peter. It|
                                        |vividly paints a familiarity with the character. For example, the story of the woman with the hemorrhage,|
                                        |which begins in Mark 5:25. The details give us a clear picture of this woman’s ordeal:|
            NON_VERSE_CONTENT_INDENTED: |A woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, having suffered a great deal at the hands of many doctors,|
                                        |spending everything she had—and nothing was helping but instead things were trending more to the worse…|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The details about the length of her affliction and how she had spent everything she had trying to find|
                                        |a cure leaves a stronger impression than if Mark had simply wrote, “there was a woman who had a really|
                                        |bad hemorrhage…”|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Another example comes from the story of Herod and John the Baptist. Herod kept John locked up in jail,|
                                        |and with detail Mark supplies about Herod (Mark 6:19,20), one acquires a familiarity with Herod:|
            NON_VERSE_CONTENT_INDENTED: |So Herodias maintained a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and wasn’t yet able to do so,|
                                        |since, throughout, Herod had a reverential awe of John, knowing him to be an upstanding man, right in|
                                        |the eyes of God and holy, and was keeping him safe. After listening to him many times, he became conflicted,|
                                        |yet still enjoyed listening to him.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |…the story continues after Herod’s stepdaughter finishes her dance. The silly girl “rejoined the party|
                                        |with hasty eagerness”; one can feel the glee coursing through her cruel, juvenile head.|
            NON_VERSE_CONTENT_INDENTED: |He swore up and down to her multiple times, “Whatever you ask me for, I’ll give it to you—anything you|
                                        |want—anything at all.” She excused herself and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother|
                                        |said, “John the Baptist’s head.” Straightaway she rejoined the party and with hasty eagerness said, “I|
                                        |want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter—right now.”|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |On the other hand, Mark is loud, clumsy, and careless as a writer, in spite of apparently having a scribe|
                                        |work with him to proof-read his Greek and to translate words for obscure objects and the like. In spite|
                                        |of his simple use of Greek, the translator must pause and think what Mark meant to say. He over-uses|
                                        |the imperfect and present subjunctive tenses for effect. He uses <char style="it">and</char> when he|
                                        |should use <char style="it">or</char> and vice-versa (ex: Mark 11:28). He gets some simple events out|
                                        |of sequence, like Mark 12:8, where it literally reads, “They took him, killed him, and drove him outside|
                                        |of the vineyard.” As correlated with Matt. 21:39, he means, “They took him, drove him some place outside|
                                        |of the vineyard, and killed him there.” In other words, they first drove him out of the vineyard then|
                                        |killed him, not the other way around.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Modern criticism asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel first, then it became the basis for Matthew and Luke.|
                                        |The critics are quick to dismiss reports from early church witnesses who contradict this theory, and|
                                        |are slow to propose theories of how the commonality could have come about.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Another point of contention is the ending of Mark’s gospel, Mark 16:9–20. A footnote in a contemporary|
                                        |translation such as the NASB states that this ending is missing from two of the oldest manuscripts. Modern|
                                        |critics claim that the ending of Mark has been lost for all time, seizing upon this in their eagerness|
                                        |to poke holes in the integrity of the Scriptures. We do not have the detail of information we would like|
                                        |to solve this mystery, however there are enough fragments scattered over time to postulate a likely scenario.|
                                        |This is analogous to how the NTSB determines causes of crashes in smaller aircraft: they sift through|
                                        |the evidence and eliminate possibilities until they’re left with the “likely” cause of the crash. They|
                                        |cannot say with absolute certainty what caused the crash, but they can state with confidence what likely|
                                        |caused the accident.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |In this train of thought, the mystery of the ending of Mark is likely explained in this way: the ending|
                                        |was intentionally truncated from certain manuscripts in the late third or early fourth centuries by order|
                                        |of one in authority, perhaps even Eusebius of Caesarea himself. The reason this person did so was because|
                                        |he refused to believe what was written in Mark 16:16-19. Ironically, these manuscripts, which are called|
                                        |the <char style="it">Alexandrian text-type</char>, are the most accurate in most every other respect|
                                        |to the originals, as the editors who produced them made a concerted effort to eradicate the false emendations|
                                        |(mostly insertions) which had accumulated over time in manuscripts everywhere, most likely in the second|
                                        |and third centuries, and they predate any false changes made in the fourth century and onwards. To a|
                                        |large extent, scholars in the 19<char style="sup">th</char> and 20<char style="sup">th</char> centuries,|
                                        |observing the faithfulness and accuracy of the hand of correction which guided the Alexandrian manuscripts,|
                                        |could not fathom that the same party who had corrected so many verses in the NT would be the one most|
                                        |instrumental in trashing the largest and most important disputed passage in the NT—but this is precisely|
                                        |what they did.|

                                        |and since the skins are sealed shut, such gases cause an increase in pressure, which causes a new skin|
                                        |to stretch, and therefore the total volume in the sealed container to increase, thereby reducing the|
                                        |pressure. Old skins, those which have been used once already for making wine, have been stretched fully|
                                        |and do not shrink after the wine has been poured out of them. When grape juice is fermented in them a|

                                        |any more, the pressure buildup from the second fermentation cannot be relieved and causes the skins to|

                                        |also called “the sent ones” </char>(i.e. apostles) in v. 14 and the phrase, <char style="it">And he made|
                                        |the twelve</char>, in v. 16, but there is not strong evidence whether this is genuine or not. The assumption|
                                        |is that it is not genuine.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">demons…</char>Lit: <char style="it">the demons</char>. In classical Gk., this phrase|
                                        |meant <char style="it">divine visitations, </char>and referred to special talents or powers that select|
                                        |folks had, and also came to mean an inferior race of divine beings. As this evolved in time, it is used|
                                        |in the NT to refer to an evil race of divine beings. This is the meaning Mark selected to use here, by|
                                        |choosing the phrase <char style="it">the demons</char>, which is not used much in the NT,<char style="it">|
                                        |</char>instead of the usual phrase <char style="it">unclean spirits</char>. Mark emphasizes that these|
                                        |evil spirits are an entire supernatural race of a sort. The phrase <char style="it">unclean spirit </char>emphasizes|
                                        |the vile, unnatural, and evil nature of these beings; the phrase <char style="it">the demons </char>emphasizes|
                                        |that these beings are a supernatural race.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">Peter</char>…The name comes from a Gk. word means <char style="it">rock</char>. Jesus|
                                        |is not only assigning him this name but declaring that Simon has the characteristics of this new name.|
                                        |Although many interpret <char style="it">rock </char>to mean stability, the meaning of <char style="it">rock|
                                        |</char>as revealed in the NT (ref. Matt 16:18, Eph. 2:20) is a foundation to build upon, which specifically|
                                        |points to a foundational leadership position in the Church. This list of apostles here in Mark 3 ranks|
                                        |them according to the preeminence Jesus assigns to them. Therefore, in listing Peter first and giving|
                                        |him the name Peter (”the rock”), Jesus has made Peter the first among his disciples and the one who’ll|
                                        |lead the early church after his ascension.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">No one can enter the strong man’s house unless he first binds the tough guy</char>…Jesus|
                                        |stated this in the context of the way Satan and his demons operate. This verse is one of the most important|
                                        |rules for understanding how demons take hold of people. What Jesus is saying is that it is not possible|
                                        |for demons to simply approach someone and take control of them, believers and unbelievers alike. In order|
                                        |for evil spirits to get any sort of control over a person, they must break that person’s will first.|
                                        |Breaking their will is “binding the strong man.” Only then, can they “enter the strong man’s house.”|
                                        |A person who is fully demon-possessed has had his willpower systematically broken, and for this reason,|
                                        |someone must cast the demon out of him, since he has not the willpower to do it himself. However, any|
                                        |believer can simply exercise his will and authority in Christ and drive any demonic influence from himself.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">blaspheme the Holy Spirit…</char>Jesus says that this one sin called “the blasphemy|
                                        |of the Holy Spirit” is unforgiveable. Jesus spoke of the same thing in Matt. 12:32 (ref. note there).|
                                        |What exactly, then, is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? The answer is in plain sight, as Jesus was insinuating|
                                        |that the Scribes had committed this sin, and what the Scribes did is specified in v.30. Here the Scribes|
                                        |could see the miracles of Jesus, and they attributed them to the devil. Believing in miracles does not|
                                        |require the amount of faith as believing in something which is unseen does. The hardness of heart that|
                                        |denies the undeniable will never turn to God and will therefore never receive forgiveness, ever.|

                                        |sense, because of the disagreement in plurality, specifically that one cup of water is being offered|
                                        |to “you all”: several people. This leads to the conclusion that the Gk. phrase for giving a cup of water|
                                        |is an idiomatic expression, the meaning of which is obvious. In addition, there is some disagreement|

                                        |this alternate reading has been rejected as spurious, the authors’ instincts for the true interpretation|
                                        |of these verses should not be. Therefore, the assumption is that v. 49 speaks of meats being seasoned|
                                        |with salt while being roasted, with salt added as a preservative. Verse 50 reads, <char style="it">as|
                                        |you have salt embedded in yourselves</char>. This becomes a metaphor; believers are compared to a hunk|
                                        |of meat which is roasted over a fire, having salt applied to them. After the roasting is complete, they|
                                        |have the salt in themselves, which means that they have the preservative effects of it. This affect is|
                                        |what allows them to live in peace with one another.|

                                        |by any person, only by his Father. For the same reason, he rebuked demons when they said that he’s the|
                                        |Christ. It is the truth indeed, but such a truth he will only hear spoken by his Father. Second, he is|
                                        |still under the grand trial appointed to him by his Father, which will only be complete after his crucifixion.|

                                        |fig season and as a result cursed the tree. Why did Jesus expect to find figs on a tree when it wasn’t|
                                        |fig season? There are two times a year in which a fig tree bears figs. The main crop is in the late summer|
                                        |or fall and a secondary crop (called a <char style="it">breba</char>) is in the spring. The breba crop|
                                        |comes from shoots from the previous fall’s crop. Also, over the winter a fig tree will shed leaves. New|
                                        |leaves grow back in the spring, and this is what the phrase <char style="it">in leaf</char> refers to|
                                        |in v. 13. Also, the appearance of these new leaves coincides with the breba crop; hence, Jesus saw the|
                                        |new leaves and expected to see figs. When Mark said in v.13 that “figs weren’t in season,” he’s referring|

                                        |A couple of relevant facts concerning the Gk. grammar in this short statement. First, the verb tense|
                                        |(present) of <char style="it">have </char>insinuates not just having once and being done with it but|
                                        |having continuously. Second, the lack of the definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>is|
                                        |conspicuous and was omitted intentionally by Mark. As a point of contrast, consider the example of Acts|
                                        |3:16, where the definite article is used before <char style="it">faith</char> (and this in a prepositional|
                                        |phrase, which often omits an expected definite article). In the case of v. 22 here, the omission of the|
                                        |definite article emphasizes the nature of the faith. Furthermore, the word <char style="it">God </char>is|
                                        |in the genitive case, but when a possessive is constructed in Gk. (an example in English would be, “This|
                                        |is Mary’s jar,” where <char style="it">Mary </char>appears in the possessive form), it normally consists|
                                        |of the definite article first, followed by the noun, followed by perhaps another article, then the genitive|
                                        |form of the noun doing the possessing. Since the initial definite article is missing, this disrupts the|
                                        |normal pattern of a Gk. possessive form, and signals a different meaning to the reader. Third, the lack|
                                        |of definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>emphasizes the nature of the faith.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">Have the God-kind of faith…believe that you have received…</char>Some of the ancient|
                                        |manuscripts have doctored a few key words in vv.23,24. This is related to previous note. A minor change|
                                        |is in v. 23: some manuscripts have inserted the word <char style="it">to</char>, changing it from: <char|

                                        |doorman’s fault and not the servants’, since the servants are expected to sleep at night. The doorman|

                                        |more important duties. The doorman’s temptation is to neglect his night watch duties, as the servants,|
                                        |those senior to him, will sleep through the night and therefore not keep tabs on him. The admonition|

                                        |modern times, dyes are synthesized at a low cost from chemical compounds, and so there is an abundance|
                                        |of cheap, multi-colored clothing. In ancient times only by harvesting Murex snails from the ocean could|
                                        |one produce a purple dye, so the clothing made from this dye was expensive. Since only the wealthy nobles|

                                        |too much vinegar would make the drink unpalatable, and apparently they mixed myrrh to limit the extent|

                                        |myrrh was also slightly narcotic, and Jesus apparently refuses it so that the wine won’t ameliorate his|

     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Let us look at these claims in detail.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |First, Mark mentions that Mary Magdalene had had seven demons cast out of her. Any forger would know|
                                        |that Mary Magdalene was brought up in v.1 and would’ve written accordingly. But the extra statement of|
                                        |her having demons cast out is not an introduction but a reminder of the grace she had received, resulting|
                                        |in a tender heart which caused her to be the first to believe when the others wouldn’t. To emphasize|
                                        |this, Mark, when he said <char style="it">had cast out</char>, chose to use the Gk. perfect tense over|
                                        |the aorist for emphasis. In support of this, v.10 begins with the words <char style="it">that lady</char>,|
                                        |which invites the reader to detach himself and ponder her history. The other women weren’t address in|
                                        |that fashion.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Second, there are a few words which Mark uses in this passage that don’t appear elsewhere in his book|
                                        |(never mind the fact that every chapter of Mark has unique words used in its chapter which Mark uses|
                                        |nowhere else). Let us look at these words:|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(i) <char style="it">Accompany</char> (v.17). This is a more specific word that pre-pends the word <char|
                                        |style="it">with </char>to <char style="it">follow. </char>Certainly Mark knew the meaning of this word.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(ii) <char style="it">Serpent</char> (v.18). A common word.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(iii) <char style="it">Hurt</char> (v.18). Ranks 2808<char style="sup">th</char> out of 5394, where 1|
                                        |is most common and 5394 is least. This word is uncommon.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(iv) <char style="it">Poison</char> (v.18). Derived from a very common root.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(v) The phrase <char style="it">so then</char> (v. 19). Two extremely common words used as a phrase.|
                                        |Mark certainly knew the meaning of the phrase, but didn’t use it anywhere else.|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |(vi) <char style="it">Working alongside</char> (v.20). This is the verb form of the commonly-used noun|
                                        |<char style="it">fellow-worker.</char>|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  LUKE Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke, the beloved physician (Col . 4:14), the faithful companion of Paul, is the author of one of the|
                                        |four officially-sponsored Gospels. We assume that Paul authorized Luke to write it, and since it was|
                                        |associated with Paul, it’s target audience was the gentile church, more specifically the Christians planted|
                                        |by Paul’s ministry. Evidence points to Luke being a slave or a freedman, serving or having served one|
                                        |Theophilus, for whose benefit he writes not only the Gospel of Luke but its sequel, the Book of Acts.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The facts Luke recorded in his Gospel were obtained from him conducting first-hand interviews (he says|
                                        |this in 1:2) with many eyewitnesses to the ministry of Jesus. To do this, Luke would have had to have|
                                        |spent a few months in Israel, and would have spoken directly with Mary the mother of Jesus and recorded|
                                        |her very words in order to obtain such precise details of Jesus’s birth. The likely time of his doing|
                                        |these interviews would have been around AD 55, when Paul was in Israel during his third missionary journey.|
                                        |Had it been any later than this, these eyewitnesses would have been deceased already, not to speak of|
                                        |the sack of Jerusalem in AD 70.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke was thorough and meticulous. He was likely a native Greek speaker; his command of Greek surpasses|
                                        |Matthew’s, Mark’s, and John’s by a large measure, and is only rivaled by Paul’s and by those who wrote|
                                        |the epistles of Jude and Hebrews. Luke has full command of the nuanced richness of the Greek language,|
                                        |and he can capture in a word or a word inflection something which takes an entire phrase to render in|
                                        |English.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Though Luke has the education and intelligence to write complex, sophisticated passages—which he does|
                                        |in Luke 1:1–4—he refrains from doing so and writes in a down-to-earth manner throughout his book. From|
                                        |time to time, he dresses up a sentence or two, using colorful wording where more straightforward wording|
                                        |would suffice. An example is Luke 7:1; another example is Luke 8:15 “beautiful and morally good;” another|
                                        |example is the simile of Luke 22:44, where Luke compares Jesus sweat to drops of blood. But throughout|
                                        |the book, he is mindful of detail and correctness, as what he writes must reflect what the eyewitnesses|
                                        |told him in face-to-face interviews. In the example of the Pharisee and the tax collector praying at|
                                        |the temple (Luke 18:11,13), Luke says that both stood, but uses a different form of the same verb <char|
                                        |style="it">to stand, </char>subtlety conveying the difference in their standing postures. Moreover in|
                                        |18:13, Luke’s prose garnishes the story beautifully (literal rendering): “But the tax collector standing|
                                        |at a distance was not wanting neither to lift up the eyes to heaven.” Luke is sparing in his use of special|
                                        |forms and expressions, but by being sparing when he does use special forms, his usage is more effective.|
                                        |For example, in Luke 17:37, Luke uses the present tense to mean the past tense—he does not do that often,|
                                        |like in the other Gospels.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Of the four Gospels, Luke captures the most sober and chilling warnings of the judgment to come: do the|
                                        |right thing or pay for it later, even if the payment might be deferred to the life to come. Some examples|
                                        |of this are as follows. Luke 12:20: “Fool—the Grim Reaper is coming for you this very night. Now everything|
                                        |you saved away: who’s it going to go to?” Luke 13:8,9: “The gardener considered things and replied, ‘Boss,|
                                        |leave it be this year as well; meanwhile, I’ll dig around it and put down fertilizer, and we’ll see if|
                                        |it produces figs in the coming year. But if it doesn’t, you can cut it down.” Luke 13:27,28: “Get away|
                                        |from me, the lot of you, practitioners of wrong-doing.’ There will be the weeping and the gnashing of|
                                        |teeth, at that time when Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets connected with God’s involvement|
                                        |with mankind (God’s kingdom) will be seen. Those people, though, get the boot.” Luke 14:24: “I’ll tell|
                                        |you this much: not a single one of those people who were invited will taste even a morsel of my dinner.”|
                                        |The rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16). Luke 19:27: “However, my enemies, those who didn’t want me to rule|
                                        |over them as their king, bring them here and slay them right in front of me.”|

                                        |many have attempted to create a written record of the life of Jesus but did a mediocre job of it. He’s|
                                        |not referring to the Gnostic Gospels or some other heretical works, but to a few Christians who made|
                                        |early attempts to create what we now know as the Gospels but whose workmanship was a failure. Luke says|
                                        |here that he’ll correctly the problem and write his account accurately. Luke, the man of learning that|
                                        |he was, was versed in the correct method of writing history, the theory of which had been formulated|
                                        |by the first century. This passage gives us valuable insight into the formation of the four Gospels.|
                                        |None of the four were haphazardly written, all four gained the approval of the church leadership, and|
                                        |the “many” that Luke refers to in v.1 were rejected because they didn’t live up the standards set by|
                                        |the four that have been handed down through the ages. The four gospels were sponsored, by the church,|
                                        |approved by the church, and propagated by the church.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |To achieve the self-set goals Luke stated in vv3,4, in addition to fulfilling the requirements for writing|
                                        |proper history, Luke had to have conducted direct, meticulous interviews with the eyewitnesses of what|
                                        |he wrote about. From the content in the first few chapters of his Gospel, he certainly would’ve had to|
                                        |interview Mary mother or Jesus, or perhaps (and this is a stretch) one of Jesus’s siblings, at a minimum,|
                                        |the shepherds who were there at his birth, etc. Conducting these interviews and documenting them would’ve|
                                        |taken a few months, would’ve had to have taken place in Israel, and would’ve had to have taken place|
                                        |in the lifetime of all the witnesses. The timeframe which fits these criteria is Paul’s second and third|
                                        |missionary journeys, in particular his third, which was around A.D. 55. This would’ve been the latest|
                                        |date for the composition of Luke’s Gospel, as beyond that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’s birth would’ve|

                                        |addresses Theophilus like he’s an aristocrat or that he had authority over him or both. This evidence|
                                        |has led scholars to conjecture that Luke was either a freedman, once a slave to Theophilus, or perhaps|
                                        |still a slave. But Theophilus had assigned him to be an assistant to Paul, donating Luke to Paul’s ministry|
                                        |like someone would donate a car to a charity. This might explain why Luke was the only person still with|
                                        |Paul at the time of his death (2 Tim. 4:11)—he had no choice but to stick with him. In any event, slaves|
                                        |in ancient Rome were often educated, and Luke certainly was. In addition, the name Theophilus means God-friend.|
                                        |We’ll assume that his name’s not a coincidence, that he wasn’t born with the name but changed it or acquired|
                                        |it when he became a Christian. In any event, both his name and the interest he has in the events surrounding|

                                        |was born a slave. Two great books were written by his student-followers: <char style="it">Discourses</char>|

                                        |The priesthood was a hereditary caste consisting of males who descended from Aaron, brother of Moses,|
                                        |of the tribe of Levi. The priests were not required to marry women from within that caste. Luke goes|
                                        |out of his way to mention the fact that Elizabeth was in the Aaronic lineage even before giving her name.|
                                        |This emphasizes the purity of John the Baptist’s parents’ pedigree, the level of sanctity, consecration,|
                                        |and cleanness, the Old Testament prerequisites for holiness. These John inherited as a result. The extreme|
                                        |degree to which the couple were sanctified to God would only magnify the intensity of the view that God|
                                        |was punishing Zechariah and Elisabeth by not providing them with a son (v. 7), one who would propagate|
                                        |the priesthood on their behalf. As there was no sin that Zechariah and Elisabeth were culpable of, whereby|
                                        |they would’ve received God’s disfavor and reproach, it must’ve been a mystery to the people why God would|

                                        |making an analogy to this. In the same way, people who receive word of God are “captured alive” in a|

                                        |this was done because the verse is awkward and enigmatic. Verse 39 describes a person who, while in the|
                                        |act of drinking the older wine, claims that he prefers the older to the newer, without giving due consideration|
                                        |to the new. While drinking the old, his heightened awareness of its subtle, unique flavor causes him|
                                        |to lose any objectivity to the different qualities that the new will possess. His fondness for the wine|
                                        |at the moment produces a reaction which rejects any substitute—even to his detriment, as he may thoroughly|
                                        |enjoy the new wine also, were he to just give it a chance.|

                                        |stockholders) thinks they can tinker with it and either to improve it or to shave a few pennies off its|
                                        |cost. But the old product is better. Or, don’t you miss the way they built such-and-such a few decades|

     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |These analogies are relevant to this passage. There were movements of God going on at the time, one of|
                                        |austerity (John the Baptist) and one of celebration (Jesus). Both are very different from one another.|

                                        |the other. Jesus says that both are necessary and that there’s a time and place for both. Another application|
                                        |is that the old-timers had a more powerful presence of the Holy Spirit in their services than we do today.|

                                        |example: “Know them which labor among you,” 1 Thess. 5:12). In the NT, if someone who claimed to be a|
                                        |Christian conducted himself in an immoral manner, this person was to be treated like an infidel. But|
                                        |ascertaining such behavior is not judging. Judging is drawing conclusions, based on a person’s history,|
                                        |concluding what their fate or destiny must be. Condemning a person is determining that a person who has|
                                        |guilt due to sin will never be able to escape it, that part or all of their life is irredeemable—Even|
                                        |though it may in fact be irredeemable. To judge someone is to weigh them by their motives and not by|
                                        |their actions. To condemn someone is to assign them consequences. Concerning judging, ref. note of Matt.|

                                        |centurion was a Gentile and that the Jews were not supposed to have any contact with the Gentiles—certainly|
                                        |not any close contact. This is why the centurion said in v. 6 that it’s not appropriate for Jesus to|

                                        |style="it">and grant that my servant be healed, </char>is the reading chosen by the UBS NT, the correct|
                                        |choice. The UBS choice is consistent with and confirmed by the centurion’s statement in verse 8 which|
                                        |says,<char style="it"> I say to this one, have him come, and he comes</char>. The verb tense used in|

                                        |clear: the centurion is giving an order to a third party, the order being for the third party to relay|
                                        |another order to the person, the one who’s being summoned. What the centurion wants is for Jesus to relay|
                                        |a command through a third party (his friends), instead of Jesus giving a person-to-person order without|
                                        |the third party relay. This is the way that chain-of-command-structured authority hierarchies work; you|
                                        |can give a command to a subordinate who will in turn pass the command down the chain of subordinates.|

                                        |verses in the NT. It is commonly understood to be Satan being cast out of heaven prior to the creation|
                                        |of man (ref. Is. 14:12; Ez. 28:16; Rev. 12:7–9). This is not the case. Instead, Jesus is seeing in the|
                                        |spiritual world (ref. “discerning of spirits”, 1 Cor. 12:10) what the seventy-two who had been sent out|
                                        |were doing in the natural world. Jesus was watching in real time; each time they cast out a demon, he|
                                        |saw a lightning strike.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The elements to the correct interpretation of this passage, first, is that the word translated <char|
                                        |style="it">was watching </char>is in the Gk. imperfect tense. In this case, it insinuates multiple, repeated|
                                        |action, not a single action; plus it insinuates Jesus watching something unfold in real-time (in other|
                                        |words, watching concurrently as the disciples were doing it). Second, the Gk. word for <char style="it">heaven|
                                        |</char>(<char style="it">ouranos</char>/οὐρανός/Strong’s 3772) can mean either the sky (Acts 1:1), heaven|
                                        |itself (Luke 10:14), the spiritual world around us (1 Cor. 12:2; Eph. 6:12), or a place of spiritual|
                                        |dominion. In the case of Luke 10:18, <char style="it">ouranos </char>means the third: a place of spiritual|
                                        |dominion. Third, the word <char style="it">Satan </char>is used as a synecdoche/metonymy for the word|
                                        |<char style="it">demon</char> (also in Matt. 12:26; Luke 13:16). Fourth, the word <char style="it">fall|
                                        |</char>refers to somebody or something losing its authority or dominion, usually by force (Rev. 18:2;|
                                        |Rev. 12:7–9).|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The correct interpretation of Jesus seeing multiple demons get cast down in real-time is relevant to|
                                        |the enclosing context. In other words, Jesus sent the disciples out, and in v. 17 they come back rejoicing,|
                                        |telling what had happened. Jesus regurgitating something which happened thousands of years before would|
                                        |be irrelevant and incongruous to the remark his disciples just made.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">legitimately claim and lay hold of</char>…Lit: <char style="it">inherit</char>. To <char|
                                        |style="it">inherit</char> or <char style="it">the inheritance</char> or simply <char style="it">possess|
                                        |</char>refer to the same biblical concept. The concept of the inheritance is that God has a specific|
                                        |place He has reserved for you, that you have claim to, and He promises to bring you to it (inheriting)|
                                        |and to keep you in it (salvation), and to restore you to it should you lose it (redemption). The concept|
                                        |of the inheritance starts in the OT with God promising Abraham a land, not only to him but to his descendants,|
                                        |and this land is eventually subdivided into continuously smaller pieces, down to individual, single-family|
                                        |lots. Such subdividing of the land is enumerated in Joshua chapters 13–22. Though the concept of the|
                                        |inheritance begins with God communicating to His man, His tribe, His people that He has promised them|
                                        |a portion of land, it then extends into the journey to get to that land and to the obedience required|
                                        |to take possession of that land. Some examples: Ps. 37:9,29; Prov. 10:30; Is. 14:21; Is. 57:13; 60:21).|
                                        |The concept is applicable beyond land to anything God promises a believer to have, which in the case|
                                        |of v. 25 refers to eternal life.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">eternal life</char>…This phrase is used throughout the NT, particularly in the Gospel|
                                        |of John. From the face-value meaning of the words, <char style="it">eternal life </char>would appear|
                                        |to mean life after death, but there are a couple of problems with that interpretation. First, the OT,|
                                        |and by extension Judaism, emphasizes the here-and-now and de-emphasizes life after death, to the point|
                                        |where some Jews (the Sadducees) didn’t even believe in life after death. Second, Jesus said in v. 28,|
                                        |“Do this and you shall live.” He’s talking about the here-and-now, not the life to come. This leaves|
                                        |the unanswered question: what exactly does the NT mean by the phrase <char style="it">eternal life</char>?|
                                        |The answer comes from reading all the passages that talk about eternal life, reading them with an understanding|
                                        |that it’s talking about the here-and-now, not life after death, and meditating on the evidence. The answer|
                                        |will then present itself.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">To choose the one good thing is what’s needed. You see, Mary considered her options|

                                        |is one of many. Put together, it’s assumed that this paints a picture of Mary choosing between good and|
                                        |bad options.|

                                        |context the omission of the definite article indicates the nature of the gift which the Father is giving,|

                                        |Also, the GT emphasizes the fact that the man is wearing armor, as v. 22 literally reads, <char style="it">he|

                                        |assumed to be an expression or an idiom. Therefore, the meaning is not presumed to be the word-for-word|
                                        |literal interpretation; the exact meaning of this expression is inferred from the context. Some notes|
                                        |on the grammatical construct of this expression in the GT:|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |1. The appearance of the definite article (<char style="it">to</char>) precludes this phrase from being|
                                        |in the vocative case; it must therefore be accusative|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |2. The word <char style="it">poimnon</char> <char style="w" strong="G04168">ποίμνιον</char>)<char style="it">|
                                        |</char>is the diminutive form of <char style="it">poimnā </char><char style="w" strong="G04167">ποίμνη</char>)<char|
                                        |style="it">. </char>Diminutives are likely candidates for usage in expressions.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |3. The use of the adjective <char style="it">micron </char>is somewhat redundant considering that <char|
                                        |style="it">poimnon </char>is already a diminutive, and by implication describes something small.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |4. Preceded by the definite article, the adjective is attributive and not predicative, which makes it|
                                        |more likely to be an expression.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |3. The use of the definite article means that Luke is referring to something specific.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">Sell…make…make</char>…The verb tense used here (the aorist) for these imperative verbs|
                                        |insinuate a few things. First, this tense is more emphatic than the default tense (the present). Second,|
                                        |it implies a one-time action. The one-time action of selling and giving doesn’t mean that there won’t|
                                        |be subsequent times in which this must be done, but it means that one doesn’t have to sell one’s belongings|
                                        |every time one accumulates belongings. Jesus is being emphatic to get them to break a mindset of hoarding|
                                        |possessions, hoarding them for fear of not having enough in a time of need.|

                                        |12:50), along with 1 Cor. 10:2 and with the accounts of John the Baptist, shed light on what the word|
                                        |<char style="it">baptism </char>means in the Bible, and consequently what it is for a Christian to be|
                                        |baptized. In Luke 12:50, the baptism Jesus is referring to is his death and resurrection. In 1 Cor. 10:2,|
                                        |the nation of Israel was baptized into Moses by the cloud and the sea. And John the Baptist’s baptism|
                                        |was one of repentance. These passages on baptism reveal the following: Baptism is a totally transformative|
                                        |event. A person’s post-baptism life is changed entirely with respect to his pre-baptism life. The person|
                                        |being baptized enters into a binding contract, a covenant, of some sort. In order to undergo the transformation|
                                        |associated with baptism, the person being baptized must surrender his life to the transformation. After|
                                        |the baptism, the covenant which the person entered into is subject to terms, terms not only for the one|
                                        |baptized but also for God. God commits Himself to terms which consists of promises, and though a person|
                                        |is bound by the terms of the covenant, on the other hand he benefits from the terms God commits to, acquiring|
                                        |the promises. This baptism-covenant pattern summarizes Christianity: a total commitment by the one being|
                                        |baptized to the terms of the covenant (God’s commandments); access through faith to the promises of God|
                                        |(found in the Bible) which protects one from the depravations of life.|
     H                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">And now why do you also not decide amongst yourselves what’s the right thing to do about|
                                        |a dispute…</char>In this parable, Jesus tells his followers that each person should objectively consider|
                                        |both sides of a dispute he’s embroiled in, and determine if his opponent’s case is stronger than his|
                                        |own. Jesus is teaching them to impartially weigh the merits of both sides of the case. He repeats this|
                                        |point in a different parable in Luke 14:31. But in addition to objectively considering both sides to|
                                        |an argument, what Jesus says in vv. 57–59 is that once you weigh both sides of a dispute, you’ll find|
                                        |that your case is in fact the weaker of the two, and that being the situation, it would behoove you to|
                                        |settle the dispute between just the two of you and not let it go before a judge and have him settle it|
                                        |instead. This parable has several applications, the first application is that one is better “settling|
                                        |out of court” and receiving the remission of sins offered by Christ and not attempting to prove one’s|
                                        |own righteousness based on works in a courtroom before God, where the verdict will be against you. Another|
                                        |application is walking in the Spirit rather than walking in your plain self. If you weight the evidence,|
                                        |you’ll find that plain-self, as it turns out, is dominated by the carnal nature, and as such cannot fulfill|
                                        |the lofty requirements of the Christian life. Christians should recognize that living their life apart|
                                        |from the indwelling Spirit is a losing proposition and should seek to redress the problem as soon as|
                                        |possible.|

                                        |modern times, if one couldn’t pay the fine or penalty meted out by a court settlement, then that person|
                                        |was thrown in prison (debtors’ prison) until he could pay. The problem, of course, is that once in prison,|

                                        |the point Jesus makes in v. 59: once thrown in prison, you’ll get not breaks on the settlements and you’ll|

                                        |a best-guess. Some problems with this passage of vv. 34,35 is this. First, salt doesn’t just become insipid|
                                        |(loses its saltiness). Salt is a simple compound that doesn’t spoil like a biomass. Second, in v. 35,|
                                        |the suggestion is to not put the salt in the ground or the compost pile (lit: <char style="it">manure|
                                        |pile</char>). Even if salt did lose its potency, it’s still salt, and as salt it will poison any ground|
                                        |or compost it’s applied to. One will never put actual salt in the ground or in a compost pile. There|
                                        |must be more to the story here.|

                                        |of mythology who’s god of the underworld. It is also a synecdoche for the underworld itself, the place|
                                        |where people go after they die. The writers of the NT used the word <char style="it">Hades </char>in|
                                        |an abstract manner; in other words, they used it to refer to the place people go when they die. However,|
                                        |just because the NT uses the word Hades doesn’t mean that it concurs with all of what the Greeks thought|
                                        |of the underworld. It is simply the place where the dead go. As can be seen in this story, it consists|

                                        |As it appears, when Lazarus became too old or too frail to perform his duties, the rich man tossed him|
                                        |out on the street, where he had to beg for the remainder of his life. The rich man’s wealth and lavish|
                                        |lifestyle wasn’t directly responsible for his punishment in the afterlife, but the wealth and deceitful|
                                        |lifestyle fueled a disdain for his fellow man, and that ultimately is what landed him in hell. There|
                                        |are commandments in the Old Testament for showing kindness to the less-fortunate; the rich man disobeyed|

                                        |<char style="it">babies </char>in v. 15, and this word <char style="it">babies </char>normally refers|
                                        |to newborns, but it’s inferred that Luke is referring to toddlers and not newborns, since babies are|
                                        |too young to respond to a person beckoning them to come. However, since the word <char style="it">babies|

                                        |(toddlers) rather than just children generically, since the word children has connotations of a minor|

                                        |chant, originally chanted in Aramaic, was translated tersely into Gk. As Gk. is compact due to its uses|

                                        |style="it">That’ll work</char>…Lit<char style="it">: it is enough</char>. Some ambiguity, as Jesus could|
                                        |be taken to mean “enough of this nonsense” or “that’ll be enough swords.” The former is assumed to be|
                                        |correct, as it is connected to what Jesus said in v. 36: “have him sell his jacket [lit: cloak] and have|
                                        |him buy a sword.” What Jesus meant by this statement of v. 36 is that you’ll no longer need your cloak.|
                                        |Everyone owned a cloak, and most people owned just one, and it was used as a blanket at night—which would|
                                        |be your only blanket too. In the long-term, a cloak was an essential need of life, but in the short-term|
                                        |is not a necessity, like when one is engaged in moderate physical activity, since the body generates|
                                        |enough heat to keep oneself warm without needing a cloak for warmth. The cloak becomes necessary after|
                                        |the activity, of course. The sword refers to going to a war. Together, what v. 36 means is for you to|
                                        |get rid of your cloak since you won’t be needing it anymore, but acquire a sword in its place, since|
                                        |you will be needing that: You’re going to war and you’ll probably be killed. Jesus didn’t literally mean|
                                        |to buy a sword and go off to battle; his meaning was figurative. But the twelve didn’t see it as figurative,|
                                        |taking the statement literally. Jesus didn’t have enough time to explain himself, so he simply dropped|
                                        |the subject by saying “just forget it, ok.”|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Verses 43 and 44 are not found in some of the most important manuscripts (KJV: “43And there appeared|
                                        |an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 44And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and|
                                        |his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”)This passage has always been|
                                        |controversial, and that because of its content. Verse 43 has the same spurious feel to it as John 5:4,|
                                        |and verse 44 has been debated for centuries (see next note).|

                                        |the ground</char>…Jesus didn’t actually sweat drops of blood; this is a simile. The rate at which his|
                                        |drops of sweat dripped onto the ground is compared to the rate at which, say for example, you cut your|
                                        |finger with a knife—the rate at which that cut bleeds. That’s a high rate of perspiration, one which|
                                        |occurs when a person is engaged in highly strenuous exercise, usually complicated by warmer temperatures.|
                                        |The fact that Jesus wasn’t physically moving and that it was chilly enough later in the night for Peter|
                                        |to have to warm himself around a fire makes this extraordinary. On the other hand, there’s dubious (at|
                                        |best) scientific evidence to back up the claim that people under extreme duress sweat blood. It simply|
                                        |does not happen. So if Jesus did actually sweat drops of blood, as many assert, that removes that experience|
                                        |of prayer out of the realm of human experience and into the super-human, even supernatural, and in this|
                                        |instance would have exempted him from suffering as an ordinary human being.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  JOHN Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |John’s Gospel stands apart from the other three—Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Synoptic Gospels—in more|
                                        |ways than one. It’s content is different, it’s chronology is different. The Greek that John uses is very|
                                        |simple and is, for the most part, readily translated word-for-word into English. However, underneath|
                                        |the simplistic wording is an enigmatic book which makes vague, abstract generalizations it does not explain.|
                                        |John’s epistles are even more simplistic yet enigmatic and vague.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |On the one hand, John’s writing needs a good copy editing. Among other things, he uses the wrong verb|
                                        |tenses, is too ambiguous, assuming that the reader will have no problem filling in the missing content.|
                                        |Had I submitted something comparable to the way that John writes as a high school term paper, my English|
                                        |teachers would’ve marked it all up in red.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |On the other hand, John has his own peculiar meaning of words and phrases that differ from everything|
                                        |else in the NT and which can only be learned by studying his writings, the simple, vague phrases which|
                                        |are enigmatic and profound. In fact, from a language perspective, John’s Gospel should be viewed in a|
                                        |separate light from the remainder of the NT, so different is his writing. Inside this simple fisherman|
                                        |was a deeply spiritual man, one who was Semitic and not Western, one who used words and grammatical constructs|
                                        |his own ways and not the way everyone else does.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Of all the books in the NT, John’s Gospel has enjoyed preeminence from the days of the early church.|
                                        |This is proven by the fact that the oldest surviving manuscripts NT manuscripts, and the most numerous|
                                        |of the oldest, are of John. And if Matthew was written to Jews, Mark to Romans, Luke to Greeks, then|
                                        |John was written to Christians.|

                                        |The usage of such a figure of speech begs the question: what idea, notion, etc. is the writer communicating|

                                        |clauses, the present tense seems to emphasize a difficulty of some sort—perhaps even a long, drawn-out|

                                        |Galilee, etc. Also by referring to Judeans, the implication is that these are the Jews who occupy the|

                                        |miracle Jesus ever performed (ref. v. 12), and it’s significant that it occurred at a wedding. This wedding|
                                        |has a symbolic meaning, and what Jesus says here addresses the symbolism of the event. The wedding symbolizes|
                                        |God’s plan for the human race. God intended all of mankind to live life as though it were one long wedding|
                                        |celebration of a sort, but then sin entered into the world and spoiled the party. Wine is what generates|
                                        |the frivolity and lightens the mood, causing the guests to loosen up and celebrate. Wine symbolizes the|
                                        |means by which mankind can enter into life’s celebration. But also, as red wine has a color similar to|
                                        |blood, at the same time it’s symbolic of the blood Jesus shed on our behalf. The symbolism is this: the|
                                        |party is over until someone supplies the wine (the blood), which brings life back to a dead party. When|
                                        |Mary tells Jesus they have no wine, on the symbolic level, she’s telling him to give the blood which|
                                        |will restore the human race to its festivities. This is why Jesus replied, <char style="it">my time has|
                                        |not yet arrived</char>—the time for him to shed his blood had not yet arrived.|

                                        |the church; etc. But the Last Day [singular] refers to the fulfillment of a different promise, that is,|
                                        |what God will do with those who died, in this case with believers who died trusting in Him. For unbelievers,|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Verses 1-11 of this chapter (and John 7:53b, the verse right before) are the story of the woman caught|
                                        |in adultery. For reference, this is translated in the note following. This story indeed is a beautiful|
                                        |illustration of the gospel, and this is the reason why it was spliced into the Gospel of John after John|
                                        |wrote it, as it is a spurious addition: the external evidence (i.e. the manuscript evidence) is overwhelming.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |As far as the internal aspects of this passage (and this is quite subjective), the GT of this passage|
                                        |appears to be more polished than what John writes (John’s text is herky-jerky); this passage is more|
                                        |fluid and therefore easier to translate that what’s found in John’s gospel. Furthermore, John tends to|
                                        |shy away from using specific, descriptive words such as v. 4/<char style="it">in the very act </char>(<char|

                                        |write something with just his finger, seeing that there’s no soil wherewith to form recognizable letters|

                                        |in the morning, and all the folk-people began to come to him, and he sat teaching them. 3The Scribes|
                                        |and the Pharisees brought him a woman caught by surprise in adultery, and stood her right in front of|
                                        |everyone. 4They said to him, “Teacher, this here woman was caught in the very act of adultery. 5Now in|
                                        |the Law of Moses it’s commanded that such a person be stoned to death. So what do you have to say?” 6They|
                                        |were saying this to test him, so that they would have something to accuse him of. Jesus was crouched|
                                        |down and kept on writing on the ground. 7As they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and|
                                        |asked them, “Let he who’s without sin throw the first stone.” 8He crouched down again and continued writing|
                                        |on the ground. 9One by one, the listeners began to leave, from the oldest, and he was left alone, the|
                                        |woman being right in front. 10Jesus straightened up and told her, “Woman, where are they? No one’s condemning|
                                        |you.” 11She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said, “Nor do I condemn you. Go and, from now on, don’t sin anymore.”|

                                        |words here for <char style="it">thief </char>and <char style="it">robber </char>are differentiated in|
                                        |a similar fashion to their English renderings. Generally speaking, a thief attempts to avoid confrontation|
                                        |when stealing; a robber, on the other hand, assaults the person or persons whom he steals from. A robber|
                                        |therefore employs physical harm and violence on a regular basis, and is a much rougher, belligerent,|
                                        |and violent criminal than the ordinary thief. In this hendiadys, Jesus explains that this thief is not|
                                        |your ordinary thief, but one who commits unwarranted and wanton acts of violence in addition to his thievery.|
                                        |When Jesus speaks of the thief in v. 10, the thief he refers to is the same one he describes in vv. 1,8.|
                                        |So the thief of v. 10 is a violent destructive thief, not just simply a larcenist.|

                                        |style="it">he will enter and exit and find pasture</char>. Jesus compares himself to a sheep pen door|
                                        |for a couple of verses. The sheep must pass through the door to get into the pen and must pass through|

                                        |eat, drink, etc. The sheep must divide their time between the pen and the pasture; they cannot stay in|
                                        |the one or the other for too long a period. Therefore, they are constantly being shuttled into and out|
                                        |of the pen, and must pass through the door—and this door is narrow—each time. If they’re in the pen for|
                                        |too long, they’ll need to get out; if they’re in the pasture for too long, they’ll need to get in. They|
                                        |must pass through the door in order to have their needs met, in summary.|

                                        |mouth—a similar type of symbolism. It may be that John is implying that, just as the bread was physically|

                                        |Father, can he prepare a place. He having to go to the cross is not tentative but arduous; hence the|

                                        |Obvious to the reader of the GT, v. 14 is a repetition of v. 13a. The difference between the wording|
                                        |in these two verses is that v. 13 is a more compact repetition, omitting a few words with the confidence|
                                        |that the reader will understand that they were omitted for brevity. Therefore, the repetition of the|
                                        |statement is a figure of speech, one where Jesus wants to be clear about what he’s saying and to emphasize|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  ACTS Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke writes another long treatise for Theophilus, who may have been his former master, a sequel to his|
                                        |Gospel. He picks up the story as he left off in his Gospel, and by the time he reaches Acts 16:10 the|
                                        |narrative switches from <char style="it">they </char>to <char style="it">we</char>, as Luke joins Paul|
                                        |on his journeys.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The book is named Acts of the Apostles, but it might be better named Acts of the Early Church.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke at times will break into long sentences, like Acts 2:30,31. Of course, this long sentence is a quotation|
                                        |from Peter, and in that passage Luke captures a side of Peter which is unseen in the Gospels. In that|
                                        |spontaneous oration of Acts 2—which is one of the high points of the entire book—Peter follows a train|
                                        |of thought through a few quotations from the Old Testament with remarkable clarity and agility, to the|
                                        |point that even his opponents marveled at his newly-found rhetorical abilities (Acts 4:13). These came|
                                        |from the Holy Spirit which came upon him on Pentecost.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |More so than the other Gospel writers, Luke’s command of Greek allows him to pepper the text with a word|
                                        |here or there, broadening the meaning with nuanced implications, some of which take an entire half-sentence|
                                        |to convey to the English reader. An example this is in Luke 2:39, where he adds an additional word (<char|
                                        |style="it">and</char>).|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke has a knack for finding imaginative metaphors. For example, in Acts 1:17 he compares Judas’s misfortune|
                                        |of being the one who betrays Jesus to someone who casts lots and loses. In Acts 2:1, the counting of|
                                        |days until Pentecost uses a term commonly used by ship captains as they fill their quota of cargo or|
                                        |tackle or whatnot before setting sail. In Acts 9:1, Paul is “still huffing [lit: breathing] murderous|
                                        |threats at the Lord’s disciples.” Interspersing hyperbole with metaphor, Acts 17:21 says, “Now all Athenians|
                                        |and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for anything other than talking about or hearing about|
                                        |something novel.”|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Luke quietly introduces Paul (Saul)—who after Jesus is the most influential figure in Christianity—in|
                                        |Acts 7:58 by showing him in the backdrop of the stoning of Stephen, letting the circumstances describe|
                                        |who Paul was rather than a description itself. Luke uses this introduction to transition from Stephen’s|
                                        |stoning at the end of the seventh chapter into Paul’s zealous persecution at the beginning of the eighth,|
                                        |eventually culminating in Saul’s conversion. In his deft use of indirection, in Acts 12:18, instead of|
                                        |directly saying “…a lot of commotion took place..,” he says instead, “When daylight came, no small amount|
                                        |of commotion took place among the soldiers.”|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |An additional benefit gleaned from Luke’s narrative here is that it sheds light on expressions and idioms|
                                        |used throughout the NT. There are several occurrences of the expression “name of Jesus” where a character|
                                        |is doing this or that in the name of Jesus. The student of the Bible deduces the underlying meaning of|
                                        |the name of Jesus by its preponderance in Acts. Another example is “enter God’s kingdom” (Acts 14:22):|
                                        |the context of this verse indicates that this is an idiom, and one should keep that in mind when Jesus|
                                        |says how difficult it is for a rich man to enter God’s kingdom.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |In the earlier chapters of Acts, much of the dialog and wording sheds light on certain NT concepts. The|
                                        |fourth chapter specifies what the name of Jesus is; in Acts 4:9, we have captured in writing an incident|
                                        |of testing the Lord, and this expanded understanding of what it is to test the Lord sheds light on other|
                                        |NT verses, in this case for example, Matt. 4:7, 1 Cor. 10:9.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |To top it off, a pattern emerges in the story line, and it goes like this: a miracle occurs, the miracles|
                                        |draws the undivided attention of those who witness it, as their attention is captured, the message of|
                                        |the Gospel is delivered, and those who hear it are converted. Treats like that are found by those who|
                                        |look for them.|

     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">stating</char>…Lit: <char style="it">witnessing</char>. The Gk. word <char style="it">witness|
                                        |</char>is used throughout Acts, John’s Gospel and his epistles, and elsewhere in the NT. This usage in|
                                        |v. 40 here is about as good a definition of what is meant by witnessing as can be found anywhere in the|
                                        |NT. First, begin with an understanding of the usage of <char style="it">witness </char>in the OT, which|
                                        |is a person testifying in a court of law. After that, study the context of v. 40 here, and the definition|
                                        |of <char style="it">witnessing </char>becomes apparent. Apply this understanding to other places in the|
                                        |NT where <char style="it">witness </char>is used (Acts 1:8 for example).|

                                        |have said that this (and Acts 4:35) rings of Karl Marx’s quotation, “From each according to his ability,|
                                        |to each according to his need.” Keep in mind the following, however. First, Luke states this as a fact|
                                        |and does not say that it was a command, confirmed by what Peter said in Acts 5:4. Second, the apostles|
                                        |were convinced that Jesus would return to earth any day now—certainly no more than a few weeks hence—so|
                                        |what’s the use of owning property? Third, Acts 8:1 said that there was a great persecution against the|
                                        |church in Jerusalem. In such a persecution, those persecuted would surely have had their property confiscated,|
                                        |so they might’ve anticipated this and sold what they owned preemptively. Fourth, not everyone sold what|
                                        |they owned; otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to meet from house to house (v. 46), as there wouldn’t|
                                        |have been any houses to meet at. Fifth, this was an extraordinary period of revival, and extraordinary|

                                        |Holy Spirit</char>. In the Bible the word <char style="it">spirit </char>has multiple meanings; sometimes|
                                        |it means <char style="it">Holy Spirit</char>, sometimes it means a person’s spirit, sometimes it refers|
                                        |to a deeply-rooted disposition of one sort or another (example of that is 2 Tim. 1:7). The NT writers|
                                        |understood the potential for ambiguity, and if, when writing, they were referring to the Holy Spirit,|
                                        |they added qualifiers to the word <char style="it">spirit </char>where ambiguity might exist. (Or they|
                                        |added qualifiers for emphasis.) The qualifiers consist of adding an article, adding the word <char style="it">Holy</char>,|
                                        |or<char style="it"> </char>forming a full predicative construct. So in v. 5, such a qualifier is added,|
                                        |as Stephen is <char style="it">full of the Holy Spirit</char>, not <char style="it">full of spirit</char>.|
                                        |But the usage in v. 3 has no qualifiers, is paired with another personal quality <char style="it">wisdom</char>,|
                                        |so therefore does not refer to the Holy Spirit.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">put in charge of this matter</char>…This key phrase indicates why the seven—the first|
                                        |church deacons—had to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do their job. They were put in charge|
                                        |of the food distribution in order to ensure that it was being done fairly, that widows were not being|
                                        |overlooked because of their ethnicity. This required spirit and wisdom. But it is not a necessary prerequisite|
                                        |for the ordinary church worker to be filled with spirit and wisdom in order to do the simple, mundane|
                                        |labor that all churches require (such as being an usher, a greeter, etc.). Faithfulness and a willingness|
                                        |to work with others is about all such a worker needs. Furthermore, the takeaway from this passage is|
                                        |that a deacon is an overseer, one who can oversee an area of responsibility which is fraught with moral|
                                        |challenges; the run-of-the-mill church worker is not a deacon. If the qualification for every church|
                                        |worker was that he had to be filled with spirit and wisdom (in addition to being faithful and getting|
                                        |along with others), then there would be very few church workers, and much work would remain undone. Also,|

                                        |upwards in hope and faith. Circumcision is the OT pact, the acceptance of and entry into God’s covenant.|
                                        |Also, the removal of the foreskin in the circumcision ceremony symbolizes the peeling away and discarding|

                                        |removal of the jackets (cloaks actually) was done so that the witnesses would be able to move about more|
                                        |freely when casting the stones. It’s also a gesture of intent, analogous to high school boys who are|
                                        |about to get into a fight and taking off their jackets and showing how tough they are while doing so.|
                                        |Once the high school boy takes off his jacket, he turns a person next to him and hands him his jacket|
                                        |for safekeeping. Now the boy who’s about to get into a fight would’ve been flanked by his close friends,|
                                        |so the person he hands his jacket to is a close friend. All of this paints a picture of who Saul was;|
                                        |he was standing next to the witnesses, so he was part of the inner clique, someone who was trusted, someone|
                                        |who, though younger, was permitted to tag along closely with the high-priest-caste. When the witnesses|
                                        |put their jackets next to Saul, the assumption was that Saul was responsible for their safekeeping. As|
                                        |the witnesses quickly scanned their throng looking for someone to entrust their jackets to, Paul was|
                                        |the logical choice because of his trustworthiness, his close proximity to the witnesses (indicating his|
                                        |zeal), and his youth (indicating that he was the younger among elders). It’s more appropriate to give|
                                        |a young man menial duties than someone who’s older and more senior.|

                                        |had ladders or stairways which led up to them. A rooftop provided privacy from the confines of the house|
                                        |(ref. Prov. 25:24), and one presumes that Peter sought such privacy for prayer. Peter got a whiff of|
                                        |the smoke from the midday meal, he was hungry already, and it distracted him. God used this distraction|
                                        |as a vehicle to teach him something new.|

                                        |creatures are specified to be clean or not clean, and if clean, permissible to eat. However, there are|
                                        |other passages in the Law of Moses where a person, for example, will be unclean for a while, but then|
                                        |can purge the uncleanness from himself and thereby become clean again. Verse 14 here alludes to this|

     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The vision came to Peter when he was hungry and the vision was concerning food—at least superficially.|
                                        |In a broader sense, it was redefining what is and isn’t permissible for Peter to do, according to Jewish|
                                        |beliefs, and the lifting of the ban on non-kosher foods is applicable to the lifting of the ban on Gentiles|
                                        |themselves. And—incidentally—this is one of a few NT passages which teaches that Christians are not subject|

                                        |in the NT where physical sickness is said to be an oppression of the devil. If this is so, how can sickness|

                                        |to Antioch (v. 26). In the rift between Barnabas and Paul in Acts 16:36–41, Barnabas’s instincts derived|

                                        |Christ, an act of their free will, made them unworthy of eternal life. Those who rejected Christ were|

     v 3                                |because of the Jews that were in that locale. You see, they all knew that he had a father who was a westerner.|

     V 9              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |A vision was seen by Paul over the course of a night: some Macedonian man stood planted in one place|
     v 9                                |begging him, “Cut across <char style="it">the Aegean Sea</char> to Macedonia and help us out.” |
     V10              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |Like he saw in the vision, we<char style="sup">[A]</char> immediately sought to depart for Macedonia|

     v15                                |that I’m faithful to the Lord, come stay at my house,” and she wouldn’t take “no” for an answer<char|

     V17              VERSES_NARRATIVE: |She followed Paul around and kept on yelling, “These men are servants of the Most High God, ones who|

                                        |were the seed out of which the church at Philippi was formed, and as a result the Philippian church—the|
                                        |one Paul’s epistle was addressed to—consisted entirely of women. Upon examining Paul’s epistles, the|

                                        |became grieved that moment and immediately cast the spirit out of her. Paul wouldn’t have procrastinated|

                                        |that the magistrates here are Gentiles. Perhaps the magistrates were Jews after all, and this would explain|
                                        |their animosity towards Paul and Silas. Also, in vv. 21,22 the bosses who dragged Paul and Silas before|
                                        |the magistrates harp on the fact that Paul and Silas are Jews encouraging Romans to adopt Jewish practices.|
                                        |This would mean that the bosses are painting Jews (Paul and Silas) as troublemakers in front of other|
                                        |Jews (the magistrates) for their own personal gain (playing the race card, as we say nowadays).|

                                        |insinuates anyone who’s “his,” or anyone who is under his authority, which would include any other jailers|

                                        |rendered literally, the jailer must’ve lived in an apartment on a floor above the prison. This agrees|
                                        |with other details in the narrative. In v. 27, the jail keeper was awakened from his sleep by the earthquake,|
                                        |as he was sleeping on the upper floor of the same building which was shaken. Also, the problem of sending|
                                        |a message across town in the middle of the night to awaken his family and have them come to the prison|
                                        |(and many cities had curfews back then too) is solved. Verse 33 says that all of them were baptized <char|
                                        |style="it">immediately. </char>So when the jail keeper took Paul and Silas and served them a meal, he|
                                        |took them upstairs to his apartment, never leaving the jail. Taking Paul and Silas out of the building|
                                        |in the middle of the night likely would’ve cost the jailer his job and probably his life too.|

                                        |<char style="it">he entered into the synagogue</char>. This idiom is used in elsewhere in the NT, specifically|
                                        |in Mark 3:1; Luke 4:16; Luke 6:6, 13:14; 14:1; 17:1,2,10; 18:19; 19:30; 28:8; James 2:2. It has a few|
                                        |different meanings (or multiple meanings at the same time). What should be kept in mind is that a synagogue|
                                        |is first and foremost an assembly of people, in the same way that a church is an assembly of people,|
                                        |and secondly a building or some other premise. Therefore, this expression means: He introduced himself|
                                        |to those in the synagogue and attended one of their meetings; He became a member of the synagogue; He|
                                        |became affiliated with the synagogue; He visited the synagogue. It may be that this expression denotes|
                                        |a formal custom of introduction where a new member is greeted by those in the synagogue. As part of this,|
                                        |the new member’s credentials are submitted, and if he’s learned enough in the Scriptures, he’ll be given|
                                        |the opportunity to stand before the synagogue and teach—or at least to talk in smaller, more informal|
                                        |groups. This idiom is also used in phrases like “enter into the kingdom of heaven,” “enter into eternal|
                                        |life,” etc., as in Matt. 7:21; 19:17,23; 25:21, 26:41; Luke 11:52; 22:40,46.|

                                        |a bit idiomatic. The usage of <char style="it">upon</char> is the same as 25:9,26 where Festus asks Paul|

                                        |a single strand of hair is slim. Therefore, Paul’s remark here is an expression, a figure of speech,|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  ROM Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Paul, the great pioneer of Christianity, the great theologian of Christian doctrine, makes a treatise|
                                        |out of the first half of this long letter to the Romans. |
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The combination of Paul’s mastery of Greek., the customizing of his writing to a non-Jewish audience,|
                                        |and his lucid prose make it easy on the translator, as his works can be translated nearly word-for-word|
                                        |and the result be intelligible enough to serve as the final rendering. Therefore, if one compares various|
                                        |works of translations, even the ones which deviate from the traditional, literal rendering, one finds|
                                        |that the translations are similar. Paul uses his powerful vocabulary and understanding of the grammar|
                                        |to pack nuances into a pithy text, rather than relying on figures of speech like a few of the other NT|
                                        |writers do.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Reasoning, philosophy, and the ability to look at various aspects of difficult questions are Paul’s bread|
                                        |&amp; butter. Whereas Jesus’s teachings are remarkably insightful, Paul’s teachings are remarkably philosophical—and|
                                        |the first half of Romans is the pinnacle of this. Paul takes the reader on a long, single thread until|
                                        |the ninth chapter, when he finally segues to another.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Since Romans delves into such thought-provoking theological and philosophical topics, the approach in|
                                        |translation is akin to the Amplified Bible, a compromise between preserving the literal wording and clarifying|
                                        |the end-result. As an analogy, scholars say that the writings of the philosopher Immanuel Kant should|
                                        |not be read directly by someone unschooled in the philosophical terminology Kant uses, as they will not|
                                        |understand it. This is partly the case with Romans also, as Paul’s multi-faceted meaning of his use of,|
                                        |for example, the word <char style="it">law </char>in conjunction with his inclusion or omission of the|
                                        |definite article is over the head of the unschooled reader, compounded by the fact that most translations|
                                        |don’t propagate through to the rendered version the inclusion or exclusion the definite article on a|
                                        |word-for-word basis anyways, as the final product in English would be awkward at best.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |To ameliorate this, I’ve preferred a word-for-word rendering of the definite article before <char style="it">law|
                                        |</char>and <char style="it">sin </char>in particular and before other words as well because I believe|
                                        |that this is valuable information that Paul is communicating, that it has a large impact on what he’s|
                                        |trying to convey, and that it’s essential that the reader get this “unfiltered.” But by doing so, I must|
                                        |sacrifice some readability for clarity. To compensate and to fully explain the meaning of the preceding|
                                        |word in conjunction with its optionally-included article, immediately following, I add an explanation|
                                        |inside of parenthesis and set off by <char style="it">i.e</char>. Generally speaking, if the next occurrence|
                                        |of the word in the same chapter merits the same explanatory phrase, I omit the parenthetical note for|
                                        |brevity’s sake, assuming that the reader will understand that it’s the same as the previous.|

                                        |whereby a person can be sure that if he acts on such a promise, God will fulfill his promise. There are|
                                        |thousands of promises in the Bible, and these are given for our benefit, to know that God has guaranteed|
                                        |something. On the other extreme is 1 Cor. 12:18, where God places each believer in Christ’s body capriciously.|
                                        |In the case of Jacob and Esau, where God chose Jacob and rejected Esau, reading into the story, God’s|
                                        |choice was not arbitrary, but was based on the heart of Jacob and of Esau. Furthermore, Jacob’s and Esau’s|
                                        |hearts were fixated while they were still in Rebekah’s womb—which is unusual. While, certainly, God chose|
                                        |Jacob over Esau before they were born and had “committed any good or bad deed” (v. 11), God saw their|
                                        |hearts before they were born and decided based on what was in them. When says in v. 15 that God will|
                                        |have mercy on whomever He chooses, it implies that no one is in a position to come to God and demand|
                                        |something by means of justice (ref. 3:19,20); this excludes God from being “unfair” (v. 14). |

                                        |This view says that Jesus was a man, but was subject to the same demise of any other human being. Although|

                                        |as the comprehensive body of thought on a subject matter the ancient Greeks captured in a book (a scroll).|
                                        |Thus, the great philosophers wrote treatises on everything from science to politics. These treatises|
                                        |were the logos for a subject, the written word on that subject. On the other hand, a rhema is a spoken|
                                        |word on a subject, as indicated by its usage in Heb. 12:20. Since it’s spoken and not written, one infers|
                                        |a few things about it. First, it isn’t a comprehensive erudition on a subject. For this reason, John|
                                        |called Jesus the Logos and not the Rhema. Second, since it’s spoken, it’s applied to a particular situation|

                                        |logos. Third, the rhema spoken about in v. 8 the “word of faith” is the word which is “in your mouth|
                                        |and in your heart” and is spoken out “of faith.” Rhema is the logos, the written word, planted in one’s|
                                        |heart and spoken out of one’s mouth. The promise given in v. 9 is that anyone who speaks such a rhema|

                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The inhabitants of the Greek city of Corinth were better educated and more affluent than most of Paul’s|
                                        |other churches, and the contents of his letters to the Corinthians show a church which is a mixture of|
                                        |polar extremes, of extremes in spirituality and carnality; extremes in maturity and immaturity; extremes|
                                        |in fervency and apathy. The list goes on. But perhaps more than any other NT church, the church at Corinth|
                                        |was most like the church in the modern West, and for this reason when one reads the epistle, it’s as|
                                        |though Paul had us in mind specifically when he wrote it.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Paul’s many talents are on display in this letter. He’s not just a lofty theologian, but he can handle|
                                        |difficult people, doing so with a mixture of encouragement, rebuke, and reasoning. He appeals to their|
                                        |best side, he chastises them when their bad side dominates. But he never forgets to remind them that|
                                        |they’re specially chosen people.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The rich variety of content in this letter, and the great chapter on love, the chapters on the gifts|
                                        |of the Spirits, the chapter on death and resurrection are simply the highlights, reflects the breadth|
                                        |of the Corinthians’ spirituality. If we today are Corinth, then by proxy we are the recipients of a rich|
                                        |epistle, and this should give us hope.|

                                        |adding this phrase makes Paul’s statement oxymoronic at face value. Evangelization, when successful,|
                                        |results in people receiving Christ, and those who receive Christ should be baptized. Therefore, successful|

                                        |Paul was exhibiting weakness and fear when speaking to the Corinthians—not when preaching publicly. The|
                                        |reason he was in weakness and fear was out of reverence for the message of Christ crucified accompanied|

                                        |smaller so as to not quench the Holy Spirit (1 Thess. 5:19), so as to give the Holy Spirit greater license|
                                        |to manifest his power. As we know from the NT, Paul was not naturally like this; on the contrary, he|
                                        |was the opposite. But the Corinthians put such a high premium on speakers with great oratory skills,|

                                        |to the touch. </char>The commentators aren’t exactly sure what this refers to; some say it refers to|
                                        |a man who lives a soft life—which is reasonable. But considering that the context is egregious sexual|
                                        |sin, and that the other sins listed in this verse are severe, this word here might refer to men who dress|
                                        |like and behave as though they’re women. |
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">To me, everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial</char>…Though Paul|
                                        |said that everything is permissible, it’s impossible to accept this statement at face-value, as he lists|
                                        |a few things in this chapter which are not permissible for anyone to do, stealing and being covetous|
                                        |for example. How is this logical dilemma to be solved? Paul is stating his perspective—his philosophy—on|
                                        |whether he will engage in an activity or not. Rather than looking at some deed as permissible or forbidden,|
                                        |he changes the perspective to look at whether said deed is beneficial or non-beneficial. The understanding|
                                        |is that whether it’s permissible or not will logically align with whether it’s beneficial or not. The|
                                        |examples of greed and covetousness Paul categorizes as non-beneficial, so it’s irrelevant whether they’re|
                                        |permissible or not, since Paul’s not going to do them anyways because they’re non-beneficial. By this|
                                        |reasoning, whether something is permissible or not is moot. Adopting this perspective goes a long way|
                                        |to resolving the issue of legalism which inevitably arises in the pursuit of religion.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">all sins that a person happens to commit are done outside the body, but the fornicator|
                                        |commits a sin which is done to (or even into) his own body</char>…The reason why fornication differs|
                                        |from all other sins, being a sin done to your body, is given in the previous verses: a fornicator unites|
                                        |his body with the person he commits the act with, and the two become a single body. When a couple is|
                                        |united sexually, their bodies merge into one body. Merging your body with someone who’s trash causes|
                                        |your body to be corrupted by the trash from the other body.|

                                        |the tight coupling of the phrase <char style="it">among us </char>to the other two phrases. So Paul’s|
                                        |saying that our bodies form a temple and within this temple the Holy Spirit dwells. The analogy is the|

                                        |appears in the present tense, insinuating continuous action rather than a one-time act—hence the added|
                                        |phrase <char style="it">go about touching</char>. Second, this verb is unusual in that it has one meaning|
                                        |when used in the active voice (<char style="it">to light on fire) </char>and another meaning when used|
                                        |in the middle voice (<char style="it">to touch</char>). Since the active voice is the primary tense,|
                                        |the meaning in the middle voice influenced by a hint of the meaning from the active voice. Most of the|
                                        |NT occurrences of this verb are in the middle voice, and they not only mean <char style="it">to touch|
                                        |</char>but also acquire some of the active voice’s definition to more specifically mean <char style="it">to|
                                        |touch for the purpose of instigating something. </char>This verb is used when Jesus touches someone to|
                                        |heal them; he touched the person but did so for a purpose. What is “lit on fire” so-to-speak is determined|
                                        |by the context, and the context of v. 1 here insinuates touching sexually. To further reinforce the point|
                                        |that <char style="it">haptō </char>means more than a simple touch, take a close look at Col. 2:21. Note|
                                        |how <char style="it">haptō </char>appears in that passage with <char style="it">thigganō </char><char|

                                        |other NT references (such as Matt. 5:31) that, in ancient times, only the husband had the right to instigate|

                                        |should have joy). In other words, this isn’t a license for a person to divorce simply because he’s unhappy.|

                                        |potential for ambiguity. Paul was cognizant of this as he was committing his words to paper (parchment,|
                                        |actually) and explicitly selected <char style="it">wife </char>or <char style="it">husband </char>by|

                                        |said that, cultural traditions stretch back for millennia, traditions where women wear head covering.|
                                        |It appears that Paul is talking about a tradition which was peculiar to the Corinthians, where it was|
                                        |shameful for a man to have something over his head in a public forum of some sort, while it was shameful|
                                        |for a woman to not have something over her head in the same forum. There’s a parallel between one’s head|
                                        |which is a body part and one’s head which is the next level up in the submission chain (Paul speaks of|
                                        |the “head” in Eph. 5:23 the same way). So the woman not having a covering over her head would be seen|
                                        |as a sign of disrespect to her head, to man.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">Because of this the woman ought to have control over her head because of the angels</char>…Speculation|
                                        |again due to the ambiguity in this verse. The Gk. words for <char style="it">have control over </char>can|
                                        |also be rendered <char style="it">be</char> <char style="it">having authority. </char>The phrase <char|
                                        |style="it">through the angels </char>can be rendered in a couple of variations such as <char style="it">by|
                                        |means of the angels, on account of, </char>or <char style="it">through the angels. </char>The question|
                                        |is whether <char style="it">her head</char> (lit., <char style="it">the head</char>)<char style="it">|
                                        |</char>in this verse refers to the woman’s physical head or to her higher-up (man). Assuming that the|
                                        |latter is the case and that <char style="it">head </char>here doesn’t refer to her physical head, then|
                                        |this would mean that the woman exercises power, authority, and control over the man, but it is done by|
                                        |means of the angels. This agrees with Paul’s previous observation that woman came out of man, but man|
                                        |is birthed by woman; both woman comes from man, and man comes from woman; neither is superior; both are|
                                        |dependent on the other. This is simply a restatement of v. 12. In keeping with this, the woman has authority|
                                        |(has control over) the man, a control which is accomplished on a spiritual level by the employment of|
                                        |angels.|

                                        |with the adjective ending <char style="it">tikos, </char>a suffix<char style="it"> </char>which “marks|
                                        |ability or fitness” of the verb it appends according to Bullinger. The adjective, having been formed,|
                                        |is used substantively as a noun in this verse, forming a new noun. This new Gk. noun means “belonging|
                                        |to or of pneuma; of the pneuma.” As pneuma has multiple meanings—a spiritual being (the Holy Spirit,|
                                        |a human spirit, a demonic spirit); related to things of the spirit; prevailing attitude—pneumatikos acquires|
                                        |these flavors of meaning: related to or of the Holy Spirit; related to or of a human spirit; or simply|
                                        |the word <char style="it">spiritual</char> as it’s understood in English. Though Paul didn’t invent this|
                                        |word, he coined the usage of it in the NT. The meaning of pneumatikos in Paul’s writings is best understood|
                                        |from the way Paul uses it and from firsthand Christian experience—not from what’s written in the lexicons.|
                                        |When pneumatikos appears in the NT, the context will guide you as to which of these various definitions|
                                        |to use. In v. 1 here, the context suggests things related to or pertaining to the Holy Spirit, where|
                                        |<char style="it">Holy Spirit </char>is a synecdoche which refers to his workings, similar to the way|
                                        |Holy Spirit is used a synecdoche to refer to the baptism in the Holy Spirit (an example being Acts 8:15).|
                                        |So pneumatikos as used here refers to things that the Holy Spirit does and not the Holy Spirit himself|
                                        |per se. This is not the case in other NT usages of pneumatikos, as pneumatikos’s meaning is context-dependent.|

                                        |something done for the edification of the body. Not everyone has this ministry. But there is another|
                                        |kind of tongues described in 14:4 which is for personal edification. The restriction of “not everyone|

                                        |prophecy, tongues, and knowledge. Not one, not two, but all three will cease. Some have taught in the|

     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But there is coming a time—probably after death—when all three will cease, including knowledge. One might|
                                        |see why tongues and prophecy will cease, but what about knowledge? Does this mean that when we get to|
                                        |heaven, we’ll forget everything we knew on the earth? I should think not. The answer lies a bit deeper,|
                                        |specifically in an understanding of the Gk. word used for <char style="it">know</char>. NT Gk. has two|
                                        |principle verbs for “to know,” and from the verbs all the other forms, in this case the nouns, are derived.|
                                        |The first word is <char style="it">oida</char>, and it&apos;s actually an awkward form of another verb|
                                        |which means “to see.” The other word is <char style="it">gnōskō</char>. Oida and <char style="it">ginōskō</char>,|
                                        |although both translated &quot;to know&quot;, have distinct meanings. Oida means to know because a fact|
                                        |or thing is obvious, it’s something one knows because one has seen it, hence the connection to the verb|
                                        |“to see.” Ginōskō, on the other hand, refers to knowledge that one has obtained without the use of the|
                                        |senses. Ginōskō involves a level of abstraction, or reasoning, to arrive at the thing known, since it’s|
                                        |not directly discernable. For example, I “oida” that the shirt I’m wearing is red, but I “<char style="it">ginōskō|
                                        |</char>“ that the spare-penny dish at the checkout line at the convenience store is usually empty, because|
                                        |people are more apt to reach for a penny when they’re two or three cents short of the next dollar than|
                                        |they are to remember to put their spare pennies in the dish. Ginōskō is also a root used to derive other|
                                        |words, but in every case the meaning still involves some thought process. Hence, ginōskō or its derivatives|
                                        |are, among others, translated “understand,” “discern,” or “recognize.” In the NT, ginōskō is sometimes|
                                        |used in reference to spiritual knowledge, because spiritual things cannot be seen, and faith, by nature,|
                                        |believes in what one cannot see, and therefore is always abstract.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But there’s coming a day when the faith necessary to believe in God won’t be necessary, because we won’t|
                                        |be living on this earth anymore. All ginōskō knowledge will be replaced with oida knowledge, which will|
                                        |not cease—only ginōskō knowledge will. Questions and mysteries will be done away with too, at that time.|
                                        |But while we’re still here on earth, there are certain things we must know without having seen, or having|
                                        |conclusive proofs demonstrated to us. There’s things that also happen to us, or to others we know, that|
                                        |are a mystery. Why did this tragedy occur? Many ask, was it God’s will? Where was God in all of this?|
                                        |A lot of things we don’t—nor ever will—know the answer to, not here on this earth. This doesn’t mean|
                                        |that there’s not a good explanation for it; what it does mean is that the explanation is beyond our reach.|
                                        |Often when people don’t have the answer, they must fill that unknowing in them and produce their own|
                                        |explanation, and often this results in speculations about God’s will. This has become the source of a|
                                        |lot of poor doctrine. Just accept the fact that there are certain things that we’ll never understand|
                                        |in this lifetime until the perfect comes, but that there’s probably a good explanation for these things.|

                                        |A puzzling verse. J.B. Phillips, author of <char style="it">The New Testament in Modern English </char>(1958|
                                        |version), wrote, “This is the sole instance of the translator’s departing from the accepted text. He|
                                        |felt bound to conclude, from the sense of the next three verses, that we have here either a slip of the|
                                        |pen on the part of Paul, or, more probably, a copyist’s error.” In other words, Phillips is justifying|
                                        |the fact that he swapped a couple words to make sense of this verse. I disagree with Phillips; however,|
                                        |this verse must be supplied with interpolations to make sense of it. Verse 22 begins with the Gk. word|

                                        |Hōste connects two thoughts, and an interpolation has been added to beginning of the verse to make this|
                                        |more apparent (Matt. 12:12 is an example). Verse 22 is tightly coupled with v. 21, being linked to the|
                                        |quotation from Is. 28:11–12. What this means is that tongues is a sign that the prophecy from Isaiah|
                                        |has been fulfilled, so that those who don’t believe should recognize it as the fulfillment of this prophecy.|

                                        |based on the context and is affirmed by v. 2, which says that a person who speaks in tongues speaks to|
                                        |God. Many have taken the first half of v. 28, “Now if there’s no interpreter, have him remain silent|
                                        |in church,” to mean that there should be no speaking in tongues in church whatsoever unaccompanied by|
                                        |an interpretation. For this reason, Paul added the second half of v. 28 to allow speaking in tongues|
                                        |done without interpretation, as long as it’s done quietly (i.e. <char style="it">to himself</char>).|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Many claim that the Bible commands that all speaking in tongues must be followed by an interpretation,|
                                        |but there’s not a single example of a message in tongues followed by an interpretation when one closely|
                                        |examines every instance of speaking in tongues in Acts. In fact, in each of those instances, not only|
                                        |was there no interpretation given, but everyone was speaking in tongues at the same time. None of those|
                                        |who were speaking in tongues in Acts are “outsiders” (see above note), so it’s alright for them all to|
                                        |speak in tongues at the same time since they’ll all be self-edified.|
     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Furthermore, as v. 28 says “…have him remain silent in church…” but also says “…let him speak to himself|
                                        |and to God,” we should infer that what Paul meant by “remain silent in the church” is actually a command|
                                        |to not speak in a loud voice so as to address the congregation rather than a command to not speak at|
                                        |all—otherwise, how can such a person simultaneously remain silent and speak to himself? This observation|
                                        |gains importance later on in this chapter when Paul talks about women keeping silent in church. The same|
                                        |applies in that case for women: he’s not saying that women can’t talk at all in church, rather he’s saying|
                                        |women shouldn’t talk out loud in a way that they address the entire congregation. This observation makes|
                                        |sense, as the problem in the Corinthian church was multiple parties trying to speak to the entire congregation|
                                        |at the same time, talking over top of each other—one speaking to himself or speaking in a subdued voice|

                                        |to, and this is not a slight against the Holy Spirit. This passage insinuates that a prophet will receive|

                                        |“If they want to learn something in particular, let them ask their husbands at home” implies that the|
                                        |women were disrupting the entire church by interrupting the speaker with a question. Not only were they|
                                        |interrupting the speaker, Paul’s remark, “did the word of God issue forth from you (etc),” indicates|
                                        |that their questions did not come from a sincere, humble desire to learn but from a position of arrogance,|
                                        |from a know-it-all attitude. These reasons are why Paul said it was disgraceful for the women (these|
                                        |women) to speak in church.|
     G                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |But we know that women were permitted to speak in church at that time, since Acts 21:9 mentions four|
                                        |young women who prophesied. In order to prophesy, these women would have to do so in a church setting,|
                                        |and doing so meant that they were addressing the congregation while prophesying. This fourteenth chapter|
                                        |plus the ancient treatise called the <char style="it">Didache </char>indicate that the first century|
                                        |church had prophets stand up and address the congregation in prophesies on a regular basis—something|
                                        |which is radically different than even what Pentecostals do nowadays. I imagine that the four daughters|
                                        |of Acts 21:9 took their turn at the pulpit.|

                                        |is responsible for those decisions, whom everyone relies on to ensure that the decisions are intelligently|
                                        |made. The second is the Latin <char style="it">princeps</char>: the one who does a thing first. The princeps|
                                        |is the person who’s the most eminent, most distinguished, the first person; the leading citizen of the|
                                        |country; the person who’s the best at something and therefore has taken the lead; the person everyone|
                                        |relies on the most to lead the way when facing difficulties. In modern terms, the captain of a sports|
                                        |team is a princeps: the best player, and as the best takes the initiative the most, and as a result of|
                                        |taking the initiative, he’s the one who leads and drives the others to victory.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Dominion [kuriotās, <char style="w" strong="G02963">κυριότης</char>)]—The literal meaning is <char style="it">the|
                                        |nature of lordship</char>. It is “the majestic power that a lord wields, ruling power, lordship, dominion”|
                                        |(Danker &amp; Bauer). The nature of lordship is the assumption that the expected order of things is for|
                                        |there to be a lord and that this lord will rule over others, and that there are guidelines by which this|
                                        |is done, either codified in law or in an unspoken understanding. As this word is derived from <char style="it">lord</char>,|
                                        |it follows that it refers to the powers a lord has and the way that he obtained them. Unlike the word|
                                        |<char style="it">authority, </char>a lord is not a ruler who derives his power from the government, but|
                                        |rather is like the owner of a large private estate, say, somewhere out in a remote rural area. In a feudal|
                                        |system this would include a dukedom or earldom, but a lordship can be much smaller also. Those who live|
                                        |in remote, rural areas are in many respects autonomous from the rest of society, including the government.|
                                        |While the lord rules like an authority (eksousia), his sphere of power doesn’t fall under the authority|
                                        |to another, so within his sphere he’s not answerable to anyone else. As expected, this also refers to|
                                        |a lordship seat which is transferrable, like from father to son, etc.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Throne[(thronos, <char style="w" strong="G02362">θρόνος</char>)]—A ruler whose powers extend to sitting|
                                        |on a judgment seat: arbitrating disputes, acting as a judge in a civil or criminal proceeding; receiving|
                                        |emissaries; forming policy, including do so with the advice of a counsel. The throne is not an ad-hoc|
                                        |judgment seat, but is a persistent seat, passed from person to person. As is apparent, there’s overlap|
                                        |in these terms for rulers.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Pastor/shepherd [poimān, <char style="w" strong="G04166">ποιμήν</char>)]—(Ref. note of 1 Pet. 5:2). This|
                                        |Old Testament word means <char style="it">leader</char>, but the implication is that this person is leading|
                                        |ordinary people (sheep) and not soldiers under his chain of command. The sheep-analogy means that such|
                                        |a leader will have to deal with problems that are eradicated in an army due to the discipline instilled|
                                        |into that army. The problems Moses had to deal with when leading Israel in the wilderness are analogous|
                                        |to a shepherd over sheep. Since poimān has its roots in the Old Testament, the word is only used in conjunction|
                                        |with ecclesiastical leadership.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |To come forward as a leader [proistāmi,<char style="w" strong="G04291">προΐστημι</char>)]—This appears|
                                        |in the NT as a verb but is also used substantively as a noun. It literally means <char style="it">to|
                                        |stand forward</char>, and appears in Rom. 12:8; 1 Thess. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17. Danker &amp; Bauer defines|
                                        |it first, “to exercise a position of leadership, rule direct, be at the head of,” and second, “to have|
                                        |an interest in, show concern for, care for, give aid.” There are only three occurrences in the NT and|
                                        |all are in relation to church leadership. |
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Steward [oikonomos, <char style="w" strong="G03623">οἰκονόμος</char>)]—Someone whom a lord (the ruler|
                                        |of a sizeable estate) puts in charge of the affairs of the estate. Luke 12:42; 16:1; Titus 1:7 are examples.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Overseer, bishop [episkopos, <char style="w" strong="G01985">ἐπίσκοπος</char>)]—The Gk. word means “one|
                                        |who visits,” more specifically, “one who checks up on things to ensure that things are in order”; hence|
                                        |the NASB rendering <char style="it">episkopos</char> as <char style="it">overseer</char>. What we nowadays|
                                        |call a “head pastor.” Someone who’s the single individual who’s the head over a congregation. This position|
                                        |didn’t exist in the early days of the church, as the early church was ruled by elder councils, probably|
                                        |imitating the way that synagogues were ruled by elders. Apparently, as Christianity diverged more and|
                                        |more from Judaism, the forms of church government diverged as well, with churches replacing elder councils|
                                        |with bishops. |
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Deacon [diakonos, <char style="w" strong="G01249">διάκονος</char>)]—A deacon is a leader (a poiman) in|
                                        |the church who has oversight over a specific area in the church, but does not have total oversight like|
                                        |a bishop does. Deacons existed in both elder-ruled and bishop-ruled churches. Nowadays, we call a deacon|
                                        |an associate pastor or a ministry director. A deacon is similar to a steward (see how these two words|
                                        |are used together in Col 1:25) but applied to a church context, as the word’s used in the NT. Deacon|
                                        |appears in Rom. 12:7; 1 Cor. 16:15; Eph. 6:21; 1 Tim 3:10.|
     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Slave or servant [doulos, <char style="w" strong="G01401">δοῦλος</char>)]—This word is translated either|
                                        |servant or slave. As slavery was pervasive in the ancient world, most of the times a <char style="it">doulos</char>|
                                        |is a slave, but since the slavery-mindset is absent from us in modern times, we must make distinctions|
                                        |in this word. This word means a servant, a menial servant, one who takes orders and is not entrusted|
                                        |with any significant responsibilities. This word means a slave, someone who’s owned by another person;|
                                        |someone who’s locked into this position; forced servitude. Doulos as appears in the NT can refer to one|
                                        |or multiple of these definitions, and the most appropriate rendering is dictated by context. In the NT,|
                                        |a doulos can be a menial servant without specifically or explicitly referring to someone who’s locked|
                                        |into slavery, i.e. owned by another person. In this respect, a person who’s “locked into” a nine-to-five|
                                        |job is a doulos of a sort, even though he’s not a bona fide slave.|

                                        |is required. A good explanation from one of the commentators is that an interpolation was intended, one|

                                        |the prepositional phrase usually translated <char style="it">on behalf of </char>has been bent from its|
                                        |traditional meaning to mean something that symbolizes something else. Also, the verb <char style="it">to|
                                        |baptize </char>seems to acquire some middle voice usage, but that’s speculative. Those who disagree with|
                                        |these explanations—and there are several good reasons to do so—are welcome to explain how their interpretation|

                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |If it wasn’t enough that Paul wrote his longest epistle (slightly longer than Romans by verse count),|
                                        |he writes a second—and not a short one either. How did the Corinthians merit two lengthy epistles, whereas|
                                        |the Ephesians or Philippians did not?|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |And based on what Paul wrote in the first letter, does the second show any signs that the Corinthians|
                                        |improved? Is the second epistle a part II of the first? No, the tone that the letter begins in is completely|
                                        |different, as Paul repeatedly uses words like suffering, tribulation, and consolation in the first chapter.|
                                        |The second chapter finds Paul expressing sorrow; the sting from the first letter is apparent. Is the|
                                        |sting mutual, as the second epistles describes the anguish, sorrow, and even tears Paul underwent as|
                                        |he penned the first? But the end of the book is telling: Paul says “the more I love you, the less I’m|
                                        |loved” (12:15).|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Of all the churches Paul founded, the Corinthian was not the most spiritual, but as it is true of a parent|
                                        |of several children whose favorite child is not the one who’s the best behaved, so it is with Paul and|
                                        |the Corinthians, as the volume he wrote to this church, the extremes of emotion, surpass the other churches.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |In the first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul gives a hint here, a detail there, of the difficulties|
                                        |he faces. But in this second epistle, as Paul progresses through the letter, his allusions become sentences,|
                                        |then the sentences become paragraphs. This culminates in the twelfth chapter as he talks about his “thorn|
                                        |in the flesh”—an oft misinterpreted passage.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The Greek text is from one who has full command of the language, unlike the Gospels or like John’s writing.|
                                        |The writer was educated, the recipients were as well. Many times a more uncommon word was chosen when|
                                        |a simple word would have sufficed. But there is none of the awkwardness one finds, for example, in James|
                                        |or in the Gospels. The writing is fluid, howbeit with words and phrases omitted for brevity, like one|
                                        |does when texting on a phone. This is one of the more challenging NT books translate, ranking alongside|
                                        |Jude, but that also makes it one of the most satisfying.|

                                        |which became imprinted into the wax, so that the cooled wax retained this image. The receiver would inspect|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |1. God has placed his stamp of approval on something|

                                        |pledge. </char>As seen in the OT (one example is Prov. 6:1–5), loans were secured with collateral, so|
                                        |a person who needed to borrow a small amount of cash for a day or two could leave his cloak with the|
                                        |person who lends him the money as collateral. Now on a few occasions Paul in his epistles states that|
                                        |the Holy Spirit is given to us like collateral for a loan. What he means is:|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |1. God hands us something immediately with the promise He’ll “repay” us with something greater in the|
                                        |future. In other words, the Holy Spirit is God’s guarantee to us that He’ll give us something greater|
                                        |in the future|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |2. The Holy Spirit is something we get to hold onto and make use of in the meantime|
     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |3. The Holy Spirit will never—can never—be taken away from us, as he is “surety”|

                                        |to the following: In Roman times, generals returned from a battlefield victory in a procession and led|

                                        |</char>the usage here means <char style="it">a living example; a glimpse</char>. Paul’s life and his|
                                        |companions’ lives exemplify a life of death and, even more, of life and even more life. Paul goes into|

     A                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">the third heaven</char>…The ancients had a different view of the universe than we do,|
                                        |and they assumed that the spiritual world, which includes heaven itself, is simply a layer on top of|
                                        |another layer. So the Gk. word<char style="it"> </char>for <char style="it">heaven </char>conflates a|
                                        |couple of concepts we do not. The first of the “heavens” is the sky above. The second heaven-layer, being|
                                        |above that of course, is where the sun, the moon, and the stars exist. We call it outer-space, but they|
                                        |assumed that these astronomical objects were closer to the earth than they actually are. They assumed|
                                        |that the sun travelled across the sky each day in the second “heaven.” So the third heaven is the layer|
                                        |above the second, but since the second includes all physical objects (and from our perspective extends|
                                        |to the far reaches of the universe), the third layer steps into the spirit-world. Now, is this spirit-world|
                                        |heaven as we know it? Paul calls it <char style="it">paradise </char>in v.4, so it may be. Ref. notes|

                                        |is not used literally in any of the aforementioned references. This idiom was originally used to describe|

                                        |10:9 for example), but at other times means weakness as the English word suggests. When asthenia is used|
                                        |to mean sickness, it refers to a prolonged, undiagnosed ailment which lasts for a long time and causes|

                                        |cap it off, v. 10 says “for when I’m weak,” where “weak” summarizes the words before it, which are “insults,|
                                        |dire need, persecutions, and circumstances of distress”—none of which are a sickness of any sort. This|
                                        |implies that the insults, dire need, persecutions, and circumstances of distress are Paul’s weakness.|

                                        |one must perform miracles, healings, or something of a supernatural nature. This is because Philip (Acts|
                                        |21:8) is the only evangelist that the NT identifies by name, so his example must serve as the archetype|
                                        |for all evangelists. In other words, since Philip performed miracles, and Philip is the only evangelist|
                                        |in the Bible, all evangelists must perform miracles in order to conform to the strictest definition laid|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  GAL Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |After Paul’s usual long-winded introduction, he curtly states the reason he’s writing, namely that the|
                                        |Galatians have abandoned the Gospel for some other gospel. This is the subject of the book. The issue|
                                        |at hand was whether a person could believe in Jesus directly without the additional constraint of becoming|
                                        |Jewish and following all the requirements found in the Law of Moses. An important aspect of Paul’s message|
                                        |was that one could believe in Jesus and remain a Gentile. This in fact is the definition of Christianity|
                                        |as qualified by the New Testament, and equipped with this teaching, Paul went about spreading Christianity|
                                        |throughout the Roman Empire.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But there remained a faction of Jews who, though they accepted Jesus as the Messiah and believed in him,|
                                        |insisted that adherence to the practices of Judaism was necessary, and therefore rejected Christianity|
                                        |as defined as believing in Jesus without having to follow Jewish practices. The Book of Galatians is|
                                        |Paul refuting and thwarting this heresy. Had he not done so, Christianity as we know it might have died|
                                        |off in the first century.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Galatians is Paul’s thesis of why the Gentiles have access to the promises of God, and not just the Jews.|
                                        |Paul demonstrates that this was God’s plan all along, that the Old Testament promises that this will|
                                        |one day take place, that faith is—and always was—the key to accessing justification, that the Law of|
                                        |Moses is just one step in God’s long-term plan for mankind, that it was at best a stop-gap anyways and|
                                        |at worst an obstacle if approached apart from faith. If Judaism were a house, then Christianity would|
                                        |be an addition built on top of it.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Most of the Greek text is simpler than—say—2 Corinthians, about on par with Romans, but there a few passages|
                                        |which are tricky (4:12–16 for one). The subject material can be difficult to grasp, but once understood,|
                                        |it comes together into a nice, logical framework.|

                                        |</char>In this context, it’s referring to Jesus coming into the rights and privileges which were reserved|
                                        |for him. This passage starting from v. 1 draws an analogy between a child who is born the son of the|
                                        |lord of a great estate but is raised no differently than a household slave. Once he reaches an age of|
                                        |maturity, he joins his father and becomes a joint-owner of the estate. Jesus underwent this process by|
                                        |being born into this world and having to live under the dictates of the Law—but only for a fixed time|
                                        |interval. The interval expired when he was raised from the dead. At that time he assumed his full privileges|
                                        |as Son of God. This is also what Heb. 1:5 refers to.|

                                        |redacting of the manuscripts in this area goes to show how difficult vv. 12–16 are to make sense of.|

                                        |wanted to pluck out their eyes and give them to Paul out of sympathy. As difficult as the passage of|
                                        |vv. 12–16 is to interpret, a healthy skepticism is in order. But the context of this passage doesn’t|
                                        |confirm this dubious claim. Verse 15 begins, “why aren’t you happy anymore?”, while verse 16 begins,|
                                        |“So this means I’ve become your enemy…?” No concurrence is found ; the context suggests that this is|

                                        |the Bible, cities are metonymies for a concentration of those who intensely believe and put into practice|
                                        |a particular doctrine, religion, etc. The present-day Jerusalem of v. 25 is a metonymy for those who|
                                        |expect to obtain righteousness by adhering to the Law, whereas the Jerusalem above represents righteousness|

                                        |who have a genuine relationship with Christ. Reading the first half of the first chapter, one immediately|
                                        |sees why Bible studies—in fact, entire seminary courses—are set on this Paul’s letter, as, reading it,|
                                        |one is swept away in a whirlwind of the extend of what God did for us in Christ. The structure is simple,|
                                        |the same word is often repeated, but it communicates profound thoughts—one after another.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Ephesians runs the gamut of spiritual life. The first couple of chapters of the book are about how believers|
                                        |were taken out of sin and given grace beyond their wildest imagination, and will be given even more in|
                                        |the ages to come. The last few chapters are advice on living day by day in our present lives, followed|
                                        |by the war we wage against the devil. All of it is like a sweet pastry which is best consumed a nibble|

                                        |in James 3:2. The metaphorical sense of this is signaled by the use of the more specific Gk. word for|

                                        |Also, choosing <char style="it">anār </char>over <char style="it">anthrōpos </char>refers to the physical|
                                        |size of a grown-man’s body. The comparison to a full-grown body continues in the phrase <char style="it">to|

                                        |has a full-grown body. The metaphor is that, when our body is fully grown, we will have attained the|
                                        |same height and weight as Christ. The reference to children in v. 14 continues this stature-metaphor.|
     G                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">to put on</char> <char style="it">once and for all…</char>There is a noteworthy change|
                                        |in verb tense between the verb <char style="it">to put aside </char>in v. 23 (Gk. present tense) and|

                                        |</char>and <char style="it">once and for all </char>are insinuated by these tenses. Also, as these two|
                                        |verbs are imperatives, a present-tense imperative is softer than an aorist-imperative. So the command|
                                        |<char style="it">to put on </char>is like an order that an army captain would give to one of his soldiers|
                                        |or that a lord would give to one of his slaves. So the command to put on the new-self is more urgent,|

                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The church at Philippi is introduced in Acts 16, where Paul is diverted to Macedonia, where Philippi|
                                        |is, by an angel which told him, “Cut across the Aegean Sea to Macedonia and help us out.” Shortly after,|
                                        |he meets women in Philippi who gathered outside the city by the river, and these women were the basis|
                                        |for the church at Philippi. In fact, of the names mentioned in this letter to the Philippians, only women|
                                        |are found. Scholars speculate whether this church consisted entirely of women at the time Paul wrote|
                                        |this epistle.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |By the tone and content of the letter, the church in Philippi is one of the stronger, more spiritual|
                                        |churches that Paul founded. Because of this, it’s fitting that they be all women, since the low-profile|
                                        |dedication of women such as these has carried Christianity—even before that, going back to Jesus’s ministry—since|
                                        |the beginning, an oft overlooked and seldom noted cause for the strength, vigor, and propagation of Christianity|
                                        |through the millennia.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The letter to this spiritual church contains few rebukes, few corrections concerning doctrine, and is|
                                        |salted with Paul’s tender affections. The lack of quotations from the OT indicates that those whom the|
                                        |letter was addressed to had no affiliation with Judaism, no knowledge of the OT. They were Gentiles through|
                                        |and through.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The GT is smooth, easily converted into another language, but draws on a deep vocabulary.|

                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |As mature, committed, and faithful that the churches in Ephesus and Philippi were, judging by the introductory|
                                        |part of Paul’s letter, the church in Colossae was on par with them, and one might argue more so. The|
                                        |entire first chapter is a discourse on who Jesus is and what he received by means of his death and resurrection.|
                                        |This knowledge is not revealed in the Gospels but is reserved for the epistles and forms a bedrock on|
                                        |the question of who Jesus was and is.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But by the second chapter, Paul is dropping hints that there are a few, persuasive people among them|
                                        |who are steering them in the wrong direction. We find out that this is in regard to practices of the|
                                        |Law, but the warnings Paul gives are not as severe as what he told the Galatians.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |And Paul repeats the admonishments he gave to wives, husbands, children, and slaves same as what he gave|
                                        |the Ephesian church. He probably told all of his churches this.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |There’s nothing out of the ordinary to be found in the Greek text. A good depth of vocabulary, but Paul|
                                        |doesn’t get into heady points of philosophy one finds in some of his other epistles, which removes that|
                                        |difficulty from the translator’s plate.|

                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Scholars believe that this epistle here is the first of Paul’s. There are both praises and admonishments,|
                                        |but not as severe as what the Corinthians received.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The longing Paul has to see those “dear to us” (2:8), his “pride and joy” (2:20), the steps he took so|
                                        |that he “wouldn’t a burden on any of you” (2:9) permeate this letter. The longing is reiterated this|
                                        |way: “How can we possibly thank God enough for you for all the joy we’ve been elated with in the presence|
                                        |of God because of you” (3:9).|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |This longing of one Christian to see another Christian has withered and died in the church in America,|
                                        |another indication of her decline.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But towards the end of the book, a couple of things which seem out of place leap out at the reader. The|
                                        |first is Paul having to address a problem of sexual immorality—and it appears to have been adultery—in|
                                        |the church. Though a spiritual church, it was not without its glaring, peculiar faults. Second is an|
                                        |answer to one of their questions, namely how will they known when the end will come. Perhaps the mystery|
                                        |is not why this church asked this question but why few if any of Paul’s other churches didn’t. |
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The underlying text is consistent with what he sent to the Colossians, as the two churches are similar,|
                                        |and Paul’s writing style is likewise similar.|

                                        |[<char style="it">lust</char>]. It’s normal for a person to have sexual desire, even a strong desire,|
                                        |but Paul’s talking about a desire that’s been amplified beyond normal amounts of sexual desire (strong|
                                        |as that may be). The Gk. word <char style="it">passion </char>is also used to describe the passion of|
                                        |the pain and suffering of death, like the passion of Christ when he was crucified—this is how strong|
                                        |of a word it is. Sexual predators and sex offenders reach this point, the point where their passion of|
                                        |desire takes control of them and they commit criminal acts. A couple notches down, it will also cause|
                                        |the ordinary person to conduct immoral acts.|

                                        |the matter</char>…Applying logic to this statement here from v. 6 in relationship to the passage as a|
                                        |whole, Paul is telling those in the church not to “defraud” their fellow brother in Christ, and this|
                                        |in relationship to sexual morals. There are two possibilities: first, Paul could be talking about a man|
                                        |having an affair with another man’s wife. Second, Paul could be talking about a man sleeping with the|
                                        |young, unmarried daughter of another man. I believe it’s more likely that Paul is talking about the former|
                                        |than the latter. Therefore, the definition of <char style="it">the fornication </char>(v. 3) is adulterous|
                                        |liaisons. This added with the additional evidence from 1 Cor. 5:1 suggest that the word <char style="it">fornication|
                                        |</char>as used in the NT is talking about grossly immoral sexual acts. Or, put another way, when Paul|
                                        |addresses the issue here and in 1 Cor. 5:1, he’s talking about something which is grossly immoral. The|
                                        |church, however, makes no distinction between sexual acts which are grossly immoral and those which are|
                                        |mildly immoral when applying the word <char style="it">fornication. </char>They should.|

                                        |This Gk. word is a compound where the second word <char style="it">love </char>is the Gk. word <char|

                                        |of how likeable they are, whereas agapā sees value in a person sometimes in spite of how unlikeable they|
                                        |are. Note that the word for <char style="it">love </char>at the end of v. 10 is agapā, not philos.|

                                        |to Paul’s response to the first letter, or perhaps another one. Though the second chapter has these answers,|
                                        |from our perspective the answers are cryptic and need second-guessing since we aren’t privy to all the|
                                        |letters exchanged. Perhaps that makes it even more tantalizing and enticing to pore over.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |In the meantime, though, the Thessalonians had fallen on hard times and suffered persecutions. Unlike|
                                        |some of his other epistles, Paul is quick to point out that the wrath of God will come upon those who|
                                        |incite persecution—not the “turn the other cheek” stereotype. Paul closes with a defense of his conduct|
                                        |among them, particularly how hard he worked to earn his keep, and that others must do the same.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The text is typical of Paul’s epistles. Paul uses a wider range of vocabulary than one finds in the Gospels,|
                                        |to put things in perspective.|

                                        |Lineberry. Their reasoning for choosing “departure” over “a falling away” is that <char style="it">aphistāmi|
                                        |</char><char style="w" strong="G00868">ἀφίστημι</char>)<char style="it">, </char>the root verb from which|
                                        |apostasia is derived, means <char style="it">to depart. </char>Furthermore, they say that <char style="it">apostasia|
                                        |</char>(the noun form) only occurs twice in the NT, here in 1 Thess. 2:3 and over in Acts 21:21. Although|
                                        |the context of Acts 21:21 suggests that apostasia means “falling away” rather than “departure,” the critics|
                                        |claim that this isn’t sufficient evidence to negate the core meaning of aphistāmi. However, what these|
                                        |dissenters fail to take into consideration is the use of apostasia in the LXX. Apostasia is found in|
                                        |Josh. 22:22; 2 Chron. 29:19; 2 Chron. 33:19; Jer. 2:19. In all four cases, apostasia means “rebellion,|
                                        |unfaithfulness, backsliding.” In other words, it means the same thing as “a falling away from the faith.”|
                                        |Paul read from the LXX frequently and extensively (it might’ve even been his primary study-Bible), and|
                                        |he was familiar with the occurrences and usages of apostasia in these passages and was mimicking its|
                                        |usage here in v. 3. But in any case, between the LXX and Acts. 21:21, there are five occurrences of apostasia|

                                        |in the early church. Since Paul precedes this by saying that women should dress in good taste, modestly,|
                                        |and exercise good judgment and self-control, it stands to reason that these hairstyling, jewelry, and|
                                        |expensive clothes were not considered to be good taste, modest, or indicative of one exercising good|
                                        |judgment. Since we in modern times don’t consider the use of hairstyling, jewelry, etc. to be bad taste|
                                        |or indicative of a lack of judgment (except for a few very conservative denominations, most of which|

     B                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Let’s assume that the amount of gold in piece a jewelry is equivalent to the gold in a Roman Aureus (8g|
                                        |of gold), which was valued at 25 Denarii, and let’s assume each Denarius represented a day’s labor. If|
                                        |there are 312 working days in a years, this represents around 8% of a laborer’s annual income. So from|
                                        |the perspective of us in modern times, if a person earns $50,000 a year, an 8g piece of gold jewelry|
                                        |would cost around $5000 in today’s money (and the same 8g of gold goes for around $500 nowadays). This|
                                        |means that gold jewelry was more expensive for them back then that it is for us, as this hypothetical|

                                        |may be that these women were spending outrageous amounts of money on their dress, and from the remarks|
                                        |Peter and Paul made, were investing their self-image in their ability to dress lavishly and were trying|

                                        |is resolved by context. When Paul leaves instructions for the anār and the gunaika in Ephesians and Colossians,|
                                        |the context is obvious: the rendering is husband and wife. Here also the rendering is context-dependent.|
                                        |Is Paul talking about husbands and wives or men and women? Most translations choose men and women. To|
                                        |justify it being husbands and wives, there must be something in the context that indicates that this|
                                        |is the case. The evidence in that favor is that vv. 11,12 are similar to 1 Cor. 14:33–36, which we know|
                                        |was addressed to wives. Also, v. 15 talks about bearing children, which means that it’s addressed to|
                                        |wives. The subject is omitted from the sentence of v. 15, relying on the verb conjugation in conjunction|
                                        |with the context to insinuate that the subject is <char style="it">she. </char>It Gk., it’s not common|
                                        |to have the subject omitted entirely. In lieu of its total omission, a definite article is used as a|
                                        |pronoun, as a definite article is short, perhaps is even a proclitic. But by omitting the subject entirely,|
                                        |the writer assumes that the reader knows beyond any doubt that the subject to be used is easily insinuated|
                                        |by the context. Such is the case. Through this insinuation, v. 15 is tightly bound to the context. Therefore,|
                                        |since v. 15 addresses wives, not women, coupled with the similarity between this passage and 1 Cor. 14:33–36,|
                                        |one may put forth a weighty argument that the entire context of vv. 11–15 is of wives specifically, not|
                                        |of women in general.|

     E                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Now, in vv. 13, 14, Paul gives the reasons why a woman shouldn’t be giving instruction. First is the|

                                        |for this reason are less qualified to be instructors. In spite of this, Titus 1:3 allows women to be|

                                        |the garden, Adam was not deceived when he partook of the forbidden fruit, and this makes his sin more|

                                        |on. The amount Paul relied on such assistants (“deacons” in fact) becomes apparent from reading this|

                                        |Paul tells Titus is similar—almost exactly the same in points—to what he tells Timothy, and from this|
                                        |we can deduce that the guidelines Paul established for running the churches were uniform.|

                                        |it, this prophet was parroting an outrageously false, negative ethnic stereotype about Cretans, which|
                                        |the prophet categorically applies to all Cretans. Paul is vehemently condemning that kind of language.|

                                        |is a metaphor to the OT concepts of clean and unclean, concepts which are deeply rooted in the Law of|
                                        |Moses and touch all the temple rituals and quite a lot of other things. Once something was defiled (tainted),|
                                        |it could no longer be used in the temple service. Care had to be taken to keep or maintain people or|
                                        |things in a state of cleanness.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |The metaphor presented here is that a person who’s clean is one who’s pure in mind and spirit, and everything|
                                        |that person handles is automatically clean. A person who’s pure will look at any fact, teaching, philosophy,|
                                        |etc. and come up with practical applications, anecdotes, life-lessons, analogies, etc. which are pure,|
                                        |meaning they’ll support or complement Christian truths, principles, and values. But anyone who’s defiled,|
                                        |any fact, teaching, philosophy, etc. will ultimately lead to something twisted, to the point of contradicting|

                                        |two people have, like when David loved Jonathan. Agapā<char style="it"> </char>-love is a love that sees|

                                        |taught to philo-love their husbands, because the alternative is to become bored with them. When they|

                                        |also appears in 1:8 as a characteristic for bishops. One expects to find hosios used in 2:5 here, not|
                                        |hagnos. So the words should be more closely examined. The root-meaning of hagnos is separation. In the|
                                        |OT, things which were holy were separated from the unclean in order to preserve their holiness. This|
                                        |is hagnos. So when hagnos is used in reference to women, it’s talking about a separation—a separation|
                                        |even from men in a sexual way. This is how it’s acquired the means of <char style="it">chaste </char>(meaning|
                                        |kept sexually separate) in this verse here. Paul might’ve meant chaste exclusively and not pure or holy—we|
                                        |don’t know.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  HEB Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The Book of Hebrews is a treatise. The subject matter is the comparison between the Old and New Testaments,|
                                        |proving that the new covenant is better than the old covenant. Though veering off into many subjects,|
                                        |it returns to its principal subject.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Because of the intensity, a translator must concentrate intensely while translating, juggling both the|
                                        |translation and following the thread of reasoning. Interpolations must be supplied at critical junctures,|
                                        |otherwise the meaning risks being lost.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Speculations will forever abound as to who wrote this book, and the only evidence we can use to support|
                                        |any theory is from an analysis of the text itself and a comparison to the other writings of the New Testament.|
                                        |One piece of such evidence is that whoever wrote Hebrews had a mastery of Greek, it being probable that|
                                        |it was his native tongue. Also, he had studied the Septuagint extensively. Although his peculiar writing|
                                        |style isn’t immediately recognizable as what we find in Paul’s epistles, one should keep in mind that|
                                        |Hebrews is not a letter but an essay, and that the same writer will use one style when writing a letter|
                                        |and another when writing an essay. Furthermore, the author says in 13:23 that he’ll take Timothy with|
                                        |him when he travels: that sounds like Paul.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |On the other hand, a simple word such as <char style="it">whence </char>[<char style="it">hothen, </char><char|
                                        |style="w" strong="G03606">ὅθεν</char>)] is found in Hebrews in 2:17, 3:1, 7:25, 8:3, 9:18, 11:19, but|
                                        |is nowhere to be found in any of Paul’s writing. One would a simple word like that to be independent|
                                        |of whether what’s being written is an essay or an epistle.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Studying the entire book, we come to the conclusion that the writer was influenced by Paul’s teachings.|
                                        |As the last part of the last chapter talks about Timothy, he had to be a close associate of Paul’s, at|
                                        |the bare minimum; but whether it was actually Paul who wrote it, we’ll never know.|

                                        |instances also where the definite article is added, added apparently to prevent ambiguity. On the other|
                                        |hand, the omission of the definite article may be just that: the equivalent of (Gk. has none) an indefinite|
                                        |article (or perhaps none at all) is what was intended and what’s being conveyed; the definite was not|
                                        |intended. Though I’m not insisting that this is correct, I do favor the latter, the deciding factor being|

                                        |to be</char>. Naturally, its meaning is decided by context. Something else which is noteworthy is that|
                                        |the infinite <char style="it">inherit </char>has a verb tense which insinuates ongoing action, as opposed|
                                        |to a one-time action. So the heirs are about to be inheriting, going to be inheriting, or destined to|
                                        |be inheriting salvation on an ongoing basis. This begs the question, what does <char style="it">salvation|
                                        |</char>mean in this context? Many Christians, scholars, and translators assume it means “receiving Christ|
                                        |in the new birth” or something similar. When applying this definition to this verse, the dilemma is that|
                                        |the angels are sent to assist only those who are about to or are going to inherit salvation, not those|
                                        |who already have inherited it, as the word <char style="it">mellō </char>refers to something which is|
                                        |going to happen in the future but hasn’t happened yet. For this reason, in this verse the word <char|
                                        |style="it">salvation </char>does not mean receiving Christ in the new birth, but it means being rescued|
                                        |from catastrophe. This is its core meaning anyways, so the only surprise should be that Christian scholars|
                                        |failed to apply it properly in the first place. The last piece to the puzzle is the meaning of <char|
                                        |style="it">inherit. </char>The Gk. and English meanings are essentially the same: it means coming and|
                                        |actually possessing what’s been set aside as yours, what’s rightfully yours. Inheriting salvation here|
                                        |is not being born-again some time in the future, but it means coming into the relief in a dire situation|
                                        |of that which is rightfully yours, a person who is already a Christ-follower. Angels are sent to assist|
                                        |Christ-followers with coming into the relief which is rightfully theirs, and to come into this relief|
                                        |on an ongoing basis.|

                                        |stimuli. In this context, it refers to the capacity to understand, to gain insight, and to exercise discernment|
                                        |based on information which one obtains through all sources that a person obtains information from. This|
                                        |is additionally confirmed by the choice of the Gk. word used for <char style="it">good </char>in this|
                                        |verse [<char style="it">kalos</char>, (καλῶς /Strong’s 2773)], as this word refers to goodness perceived|
                                        |from the outside, as opposed to goodness which exists on the inside of someone. The goodness is perceived|
                                        |from the outside through the faculties of perception spoken of here. But in practical terms, what the|
                                        |writer of Hebrews is referring to is a person who through practice and experience is able to observe|
                                        |a given situation and through little pieces of information gleaned here and there is able to see the|
                                        |good and the evil in that situation, and distinguish between the two. One example is this: years ago|
                                        |my brother-in-law used to top by my mother-in-law’s apartment briefly, bring friends occasionally, and|
                                        |after listening to these guys talk casually a bit could tell if they were no good or not. She was always|
                                        |right. Another example: I’m thinking of a well-known evangelist who had a huge ministry who died a few|
                                        |years ago. Just about everyone in the city in which he lived either praised him as a great saint who|
                                        |could do no wrong or condemned him as a horrible sinner who could do no right. The truth is that he was|
                                        |a mixture of both good and bad, but hardly anyone in the city would say that that was the case. The problem,|
                                        |you see, is that they couldn’t distinguish good from bad.|

                                        |derived from the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char><char style="w" strong="G00907">βαπτίζω</char>).|
                                        |The connection to the word <char style="it">baptism </char>is obvious; nearly every (perhaps every) rendering|
                                        |of <char style="it">baptism </char>in English comes from these words. Some translations like the NASB|
                                        |render this “instructions about washings,” which is incorrect. First, the words “instructions about”|
                                        |are an interpolation (that is to say, they don’t exist in the GT and were added to make sense of the|
                                        |text). Second, “instructions about washings” are covered in “repentance from dead works”; no need to|
                                        |cover it again. Third, the context decides any ambiguity. This word <char style="it">baptismos</char>|
                                        |appears four times in the NT, here and in 2 Cor. 2:12; Mark 7:4; Heb. 9:10. The times in which it means|
                                        |a dipping in water or ceremonial washings are obvious by the context. As this passage is about “fundamental|
                                        |doctrines,” is not baptism a fundamental doctrine? Have their not been entire denominational splits over|
                                        |this issue? Is it not a pillar of the Christian faith? Fourth, although <char style="it">baptismos </char>as|
                                        |used in the NT is context-variable, the verb <char style="it">baptizō </char>is mostly used to refer|
                                        |to baptism. Fifth, those who render <char style="it">baptismos</char> as “instructions about washings”|
                                        |do so primarily to avoid the obvious fact that this word is plural (baptisms) not singular (baptism).|
                                        |They do so because they believe there is only one type of baptism relevant to the church today, namely|
                                        |water baptism, and if they were to render this word literally as what it obviously is—baptisms—they would|
                                        |they would be forced to acknowledge that there is a second baptism, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and|
                                        |that this baptism wasn’t just for the early church but is for believers today.|
     C                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">eternal judgment</char>…The “fundamental doctrines of Christ” should be understood as|
                                        |the essential doctrines of Christianity. A brief description: “repentance from dead works” is the abandonment|
                                        |of the notion that obeying the Law of Moses or any other list of rules is your ticket to obtaining righteousness.|
                                        |This is coupled with “faith in God”: that we obtain righteousness by faith. As these are the crux of|
                                        |Paul’s message, the writer of Hebrews was at a minimum a disciple of Paul. Next are the “doctrines”:|
                                        |baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead coupled with eternal judgment. The doctrine|
                                        |of baptisms is that a person who accepts Christ as Savior should be immediately baptized in water without|
                                        |delay. Also, there is a second baptism which occurs after accepting Christ, that is the baptism in the|
                                        |Holy Spirit. It is accompanied by speaking in tongues. The doctrine of the laying on of hands institutes|
                                        |a holy ordinance for the church to practice in the form of one or several believers placing their hands|
                                        |on another believer while at the same time praying. This was done in the Bible for praying for the sick,|
                                        |for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and for ordination into the ministry. The next doctrine is the resurrection|
                                        |of the dead, which in the NT refers to life after death. The doctrine asserts that we don’t cease to|
                                        |exist when we die, but that we live on eternally in another life, in another body, be it eternal bliss|
                                        |or eternal damnation. The final doctrine, one which connect s to the previous, is eternal judgment: that|
                                        |when our lives are over, we will stand before God in judgment, the outcome for which will be rewards|
                                        |and punishments.|
     D                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |<char style="it">unable to engage again in the process of renewing themselves with the goal of repentance|
                                        |in mind</char>…The verb tense in the infinitive <char style="it">renew </char>speaks of the process of|

                                        |of changing. His will is altered to where he will not change again. It’s not that God cannot forgive|
                                        |him, it’s that he will never, ever change. The once-saved-always-saved teaching should be reconsidered|
                                        |in light of this passage.|

                                        |wording of the GT, the term “Holy of Holies” is introduced in 9:3, and the GT literally reads “holy of|
                                        |holies.” Thenceforth, however, the author of Hebrews shortens the literal phrase from <char style="it">holy|
                                        |of holies </char>to <char style="it">of the holies </char>(9:8); <char style="it">the holies </char>(9:12,25);|

                                        |appears in 10:19 is yet another usage of a shortened form of Holy of Holies, a repetition of the wording|
                                        |which appeared in 9:8 when you get right down to it.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  JAMES Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |James addresses his epistle to Jewish believers, as he was the leader of the Jewish faction of the church.|
                                        |His wisdom is in the Semitic style that his brother Jesus used rather than the Greek style that Paul|
                                        |uses, giving it an unusual flavor which complements the other epistles.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Church tradition holds that James prayed so much that his knees were calloused. His dedication to prayer|
                                        |comes across in the letter.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Looking at the Greek text, James’s writing style is straightforward, shying away from some of the exotic|
                                        |verb tenses and particles one finds Luke and Paul using, but he also displays a deep vocabulary, using|
                                        |words which are not found anywhere else in the NT. For example, the words <char style="it">like </char>and|
                                        |<char style="it">driven by, </char>both occurring in 1:6; or the word <char style="it">declarations</char>|
                                        |(<char style="it">boasting</char>) in 3:5; or the word <char style="it">stoker </char>in 3:6. James’s|
                                        |writing is rich in metaphors and other figures of speech and is seasoned with words and concepts which|
                                        |came directly from his brother, such as the “trophy of life” in 1:12. James’s generous use of metaphors|
                                        |(like “bridle his tongue” in 1:26) and other figures of speech makes this a rich piece of literature|
                                        |and should be high on the list of books in the Bible that should be read purely for literary content,|
                                        |such as English class readings.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But it’s more important to get the gist of what James says rather than parse with a fine-toothed comb|
                                        |his writing looking for logical fallacies, as his writing is similar to John’s, not written like a science|
                                        |textbook. A fair amount of interpolations are necessary to prevent the book from being lost on the reader.|
                                        |An example of this is 4:5, where he cites the Old Testament and Bible scholars can’t find the exact verse|
                                        |he’s quoting from.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |But after granting this allowance and understanding who James is, one begins to see things from his point|
                                        |of view. He talks about the “perfect code” and “freedom’s code” being the Law of Moses on the surface,|
                                        |but underneath focuses on the more important aspects of the Law that Jesus emphasized, such as loving|
                                        |your neighbor and helping the poor. Unlike many of the strict Jews of the day, James isn’t caught up|
                                        |in the rituals of the Law; a keeper of the Law will act in love towards others—not like the rich, whom|
                                        |he disdains since they are oppressive.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Speaking of the rich, James defines the Judeo-Christian perspective of oppressor vs. oppressed, telling|
                                        |the oppressive-rich to stop oppressing the poor, excoriating them morally. This is unlike the Marxist|
                                        |perspective which seeks to eliminate the rich and change the entire economic system.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |James pulls in concepts from the Old Testament and gives us continuity, taking the cue from Jesus, as|
                                        |both James and Jesus teach that these concepts have not changed but have been better defined. The Law|
                                        |of Moses is the most prominent example, but there are other concepts such as “God is One” (2:19; 4:12)|
                                        |and what the nature of faith is.|

                                        |James makes the distinction between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers. Since James’s authority|
                                        |is over the church in Jerusalem, and perhaps all of Israel, he extends his pastoral care to all believing|

                                        |those living in Israel. At the time this epistle was written, there were more Jews outside of Israel|
                                        |than there were in Israel. But the schism in the early church between the Jewish and the non-Jewish believers|
                                        |would naturally cause the Jewish believers living outside of Israel to gravitate towards and affiliate|

                                        |wreath. The word <char style="it">life</char> leans on the definition Jesus put forth in John 6:53, “if|
                                        |you won’t eat the Man’s flesh and drink his blood, you don’t have life within you.” In the next verse|
                                        |Jesus goes on to talk about eternal life, which is that special fullness of life that God gives. By this|
                                        |reasoning, the word <char style="it">life </char>in v. 12 here does not refer to physical existence but|
                                        |rather is the same concept of life and eternal life which Jesus taught. What James is saying is that|
                                        |perseverance through trials and temptations results in a deep richness to one’s life.|

                                        |in this verse is similar in meaning to the way it’s used in Heb. 10:1; i.e., it’s not a physical shadow|
                                        |but rather an imperfect representation of another object. The Gk. words for<char style="it"> variation|

                                        |ancient times that the movement of the planets, the rotation of the earth, etc. are extremely precise|
                                        |and entirely predictable. Therefore, James is saying that the same God who put into place such precision|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  PET1 Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The final one of the multiple faces we see of Peter is contained in his epistle, and it’s hard to imagine|
                                        |them being the same person. The Peter of the Gospels is impulsive; the Peter of Acts is the first church|
                                        |leader; the Peter of Galatians is called out for wrong-doing—but the Peter of this epistle is gracious|
                                        |and mature.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Peter the pastor admonishes the readers in a positive manner, steering them in the right direction, calling|
                                        |them to a higher walk with the Lord, encouraging them, reminding them of who they now are.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Like other epistles, the Greek text is choppy, as one expects in a letter. A translator finds himself|
                                        |gleaning the gist of what Peter writes and wording it in his native language, deviating from the word-for-word|
                                        |methodology. Sometimes the letter appears to have grammatical errors or the literal reading isn’t so|
                                        |logical (an example is 2:5). The novice reader may have trouble following all of Peter’s OT references.|
                                        |In spite of the fact that what Peter says isn’t written in a straightforward manner, Peter’s message|
                                        |is clear. Case in point is the beginning of the third chapter, when Peter is talking about what women|
                                        |wear. Logical?—not exactly. But the point is clear.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Peter’s epistle is tender and commends what some would categorize as feminine virtues (3:8), and he has|
                                        |obviously been transformed from the impetuous fisherman of the Gospels. But his epistles hops about from|
                                        |here to there, randomly redirected to apocalyptic insights and symbolism found in the Old Testament a|
                                        |few verses later (3:19–22). The speed at which Peter makes points, but then hops to another topic, is|
                                        |breathtaking. He never lets the foot off the gas pedal, covering a lot of ground in a short letter. Upon|
                                        |reading the epistle in one sitting, the reader will likely affirm that everything which could have been|
                                        |said was said and that nothing more need be added.|

                                        |The word <char style="it">inheritance </char>as used in the NT leverages the concept of an inheritance|

                                        |was partitioned by tribe, by clan, and finally by family. This spiritual “land” consists of promises|
                                        |given in the Bible; of the movement of the Holy Spirit collectively in a denomination, a church, and|

                                        |in the NT. The most tremendous growth spurt that a human being experiences is when a one is a newborn|

                                        |There are multiple words in the NT which essentially mean <char style="it">to order, to give a command,|
                                        |</char>etc. The stem from which the word <char style="it">arrange </char>comes means to given an order,|
                                        |and it was a military term used when a commander issued orders to deploy units of phalanxes, etc. on|
                                        |a battlefield. A good arrangement of the units, and one which was carried out successfully, was crucial|
                                        |to victory on the battlefield. So <char style="it">hupotassō</char> means to allow oneself to be “arranged”|
                                        |by the person in command, knowing that the one in command has the overall view of what needs to be put|
                                        |and where and is placing you in position according to a master plan—a plan which you might not even be|
                                        |familiar with. This shade of meaning to the word <char style="it">submit </char>differs from a shade|
                                        |of meaning of an underling being crushed by an oppressive overlord.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |In this regard, the Gk. word <char style="it">hypakouō</char> <char style="w" strong="G05219">ὑπακούω</char>),|
                                        |which corresponds <char style="it">to obey</char>, literally means <char style="it">under the giving-ear-to.|
                                        |</char>This refers to being under the audible sound—the voice commands—of another person. The nature|
                                        |of the word is that one person is to simply obey the spoken-orders (and this would apply to any order,|
                                        |not just a spoken one) of the one above him. The emphasis is on simple obedience to the order, without|
                                        |questions asked and without an expectation that the one obeying will understand the big-picture. And|
                                        |this is where submit and obey diverge. The one who submits understands that his submission is necessary|
                                        |to accomplish the overall goal; that he should understand the overall goal and understand that he is|
                                        |one of multiple parties, all of whom must do his part and comply with his specific command for the sake|

                                        |Therefore, a child or a slave is expected to obey, not submit, but an adult, one who has heavy responsibilities,|
                                        |such as a soldier, is told to submit, not obey.|
     F                FOOTNOTES_NORMAL: |Throughout history, there have been two methods whereby the common soldier takes orders from a superior:|
                                        |the soldier can submit or he can obey. Generally speaking, armies where the soldiers submit are more|
                                        |effective than armies where the soldiers obey. Those who submit are encouraged to think beyond their|
                                        |individual contribution, and because of that, a person who submits may at times improvise according to|

                                        |plan. Soldiers who simply obey will fear potential retribution due to improvisation and not exploit opportunities|

                                        |nicely in the context. As Christianity evolved into the late first and early second centuries, churches|
                                        |governed by elder bodies were replaced by churches governed by a single person—a bishop. They sought|
                                        |to stamp out any suggestion in the NT that churches can or should be governed by elder boards and not|
                                        |by bishops; hence, the addition of the word <char style="it">episkopountes </char>to some of the manuscripts.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  PET2 Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |2 Peter is a long, brilliantly-written diatribe against evil people and has a different flavor than 1|
                                        |Peter, and this is one reason why the authenticity of its authorship is in question. 2 Peter and Jude|
                                        |are similar books and both faced opposition when the canon was first formalized, with several dissenters|
                                        |who wanted to exclude it.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The Greek writing style is a bit choppy in parts, but fluid overall. There is a beauty to the prose as|
                                        |it keeps on a subject while moving from point to point. The transitions are smooth, the verses are sprinkled|
                                        |with metaphors. Overall, the book is as enjoyable to translate as it is to read. It’s a pity that this|
                                        |translation squashes beautiful figures of speech such as found in 2:9 which in the Greek text literally|
                                        |reads, “the Lord knows to rescue the pious”; the figure of speech means that the Lord has a long history|
                                        |of rescuing the pious and will certainly continue to do so.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |This epistle has many vocabulary words not found elsewhere in the NT. Between this and the fact that|
                                        |it has not received the attention and scholarship that the more popular NT books have received makes|
                                        |it more difficult to resolve the meaning of certain words, an example being 2:17 where the word “mist”|
                                        |is assumed to be “drizzle.”|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The assertion that the author makes in 3:16, namely that he considers Paul’s epistles to be on par with|
                                        |Scripture, is a view which didn’t evolve until later; when writing his epistles, Paul didn’t believe|
                                        |he was penning Scripture.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The author goes out of his way to assure us that this letter is in fact the second epistle (3:1), but|
                                        |giving that assurance is not reassuring: the letter smells like a fraud—howbeit, a well-written one.|
                                        |The epistle expends too much vitriol railing against the corrupt and too little encouraging believers,|
                                        |which doesn’t help its case. And perhaps it is this vitriol which caused a writer other than Peter to|
                                        |lie and claim to be him. We’ll never know.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  JOHN1 Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The epistle of 1 John repeats several phrases from the talks Jesus had at the Last Supper and shortly|
                                        |after, chapters 14–17. Since a large percentage of the Gospel of John consists of the last couple of|
                                        |weeks of Jesus’s life, namely the Last Supper, John was profoundly moved by it and repeated it in 1 John.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |1 John is enigmatic, and appears at times to contradict itself. John presents things in binary form,|
                                        |in diametrically opposed qualities: love vs. hate, light vs. darkness, sin vs. righteousness. Like his|
                                        |Gospel, many of the words he prefers take on their own peculiar meanings, words such as <char style="it">receive</char>,|
                                        |<char style="it">witness</char>, <char style="it">dwell</char>, <char style="it">children</char>, <char|
                                        |style="it">fathers</char>. To appreciate this epistle, the reader must approach it from a different perspective|
                                        |than the other epistles, one that’s less cerebral and more spiritual. Naturally, this is the very aspect|
                                        |which many have come to love, as this epistle has endeared itself into their hearts.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The Greek text is perhaps the simplest in the NT; this is the preferred first non-textbook reading assignment|
                                        |for the novice Greek student. John intentionally uses a small set of words and simple grammatical constructs.|
                                        |It comes across the same way in the rendered text.|

                                        |<char style="it">anointing</char>. Also, ref. note of Luke 4:18. The word <char style="it">anointing|
                                        |</char>refers to pouring oil over someone (ex: John 11:2). Throughout the Bible, anointing a person marks|
                                        |that person with extraordinary abilities, abilities which originate from God and are actuated by means|
                                        |of the Holy Spirit (are a manifestation of the Holy Spirit). These special abilities are specific to|
                                        |that one person and are for a particular purpose. In this context of 1 John 2, John’s usage of the word|
                                        |<char style="it">anointing </char>is an extraordinary ability bestowed on each believer, but like any|
                                        |anointing, the extraordinary ability is unique to that person; no other person receives the same anointing.|
                                        |The 1 John 2 anointing is the ability to understand how exactly one should conduct himself in a godly|
                                        |manner on a day-to-day basis. The 1 John 2 anointing gives a person the ability to discern for himself|
                                        |what the correct thing is for him to do in life. Incidentally, this passage here refutes the notion that|
                                        |any church leader (especially a cult leader) should be deciding what an individual church member should|
                                        |do in their circumstances of life, especially to a fine detail.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  JUDE Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |This epistle written in an unambiguous, fluid, textbook-like style not only demonstrates the writer’s|
                                        |command of Greek but also shows his clarity of mind and ability to express himself throughout a long|
                                        |warning about “certain people who have infiltrated our community.” But at the bottom of the epistle,|
                                        |there is some meat for Christians to feed on, and most gravitate towards this.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The author of this epistle writes in a style which is similar to that of 2 Peter, and the subject-matter|
                                        |of both epistles is the same. In fact, some uncommon words—and even phrases—are common to both 2 Peter|
                                        |and Jude. For example: <char style="it">gloom </char>(v. 6); <char style="it">glories </char>(v. 8 &amp;|
                                        |2 Pet. 2:10); the specific usage of <char style="it">blasphemy </char>(v. 9); <char style="it">ridiculous|
                                        |creature in nature </char>(v. 10 &amp; 2 Pet. 2:12); plus several more. Is it plausible that the same|
                                        |author wrote both epistles? The commonality of words and phrases means that, at a minimum, both authors|
                                        |were members of the same tight circle of associates.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Verses 6 and 7 build on a theory about fallen angels which scholars believe comes from the Book of Enoch,|
                                        |which the epistle quotes in vv. 14,15, treating the source material as though it’s canonical. And in|
                                        |v. 9 he draws from an account about Moses which comes from a writing other than the OT, but at the same|
                                        |time assumes the reader is familiar with the story.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |It’s no surprise, then, that when the church fathers gathered to settle the NT canon, these two books|
                                        |were heavily contested.|

  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>  REV Introduction  <<<<<<<<<<<<
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |The final piece of John’s portfolio of writings differs from the others. Revelation is a continuation|
                                        |of the prophesies in Genesis, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah, and the novice reader, lacking an overall|
                                        |view of the Bible, jumps into Revelation without first getting up to speed on those other books. This|
                                        |is explained in the author’s book <char style="it">A Path through Revelation.</char>|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |There are, however, numerous grammatical mistakes in Revelation, and this leaves one to wonder what the|
                                        |cause of these mistakes is. Can we assume that John wrote the book with the help of a scribe?— Scribes|
                                        |normally edit out such errors. In addition, it appears that John jumbles verb tenses throughout. This|
                                        |might be him seeing a vision in the present of something that will happen in the future as though it|
                                        |happened already but as though he witnessed it in real-time. Some of these mistakes are probably John|
                                        |not remembering the form of a particular verb. He does have a mastery of what the forms do, but Greek|
                                        |is convoluted. Some of the “mistakes” can be chalked up to John’s writing style, his peculiar figures|
                                        |of speech. The long note in Rev. 8:3 captures an example of such grammatical errors.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |Revelation does follow John’s propensity to utilize a smaller vocabulary than the likes of Paul, but|
                                        |the Greek text is both simple and complex at the same time. When translating it, one finds himself not|
                                        |so much following the literal meaning of the words and the nuances of the forms, but standing back and|
                                        |getting the gist of what’s being said and then putting that down. It’s as though one is listening closely|
                                        |to someone speaking to the broken-Greek, then putting the pieces together. At times, this becomes difficult|
                                        |because Revelation is so bizarre, and one doesn’t know if he’s encountering weirdness or John’s weakness|
                                        |in describing something. For example, Rev. 13:18, “it’s a man’s number”—not quite sure if that’s something|
                                        |ordinary that’s not explained well or if it’s yet another mystery of Revelation.|
                     NON_VERSE_CONTENT: |John’s final book complements his other writings since it differs in style from his gospel and his epistles.|
                                        |After a close reading of the Greek text, he appears to be a strong-willed person who does things his|
                                        |own way. He’s not as loud as Mark (and Peter by extension), but isn’t one who submits to accepted conventions|
                                        |of writing like Luke. To read John’s books is to enter his world and to go to him, for he will not go|
                                        |to you.|

                                        |that Ray Summers in his book <char style="it">Worthy Is the Lamb</char> claimed were grammatical mistakes.|
                                        |The verb <char style="it">stand </char>here is in the passive voice but most translations, such as the|
                                        |NASB, translate it as active. The word <char style="it">give </char>in v. 3 translated <char style="it">offer|
                                        |up</char> is future tense but should be subjunctive. The words <char style="it">the prayers </char>is|
                                        |in the dative case, which is unexpected. In v. 5 the verb <char style="it">to take </char>is in the perfect|
                                        |tense, but is used like it’s aorist. Some observations on the claim that these are grammatical errors.|
                                        |First, looking at John’s contributions to the NT as a whole and not just at Revelation individually,|
                                        |Revelation is the only book with these kinds of errors. In the grammatical incidences enumerated from|
                                        |this passage, it’s hard to imagine that these would not have been mistakes caused by ignorance of the|
                                        |language. Now, grammatical mistakes are made when someone’s careless, perhaps writing while he’s tired|
                                        |or writing in too much of a hurry. And that may be the case. But inspecting a couple of the verb forms|
                                        |which are listed here, the passive form of <char style="it">to stand </char>and the perfect form of <char|
                                        |style="it">to take </char>are less common than the expected forms. Someone who’s sloppy, careless, or|
                                        |rushed would use the more common forms instead of the less common. So what’s the conclusion? Perhaps|
                                        |John couldn’t remember some of the forms of words and knew that the reader would be able to figure it|
                                        |out. Or he understood what he was writing and deliberately chose to write it and these are not mistakes.|
                                        |This leaves a translator with the task of figuring out what he meant on a case-by-case basis.|

                                        |In NT times, the sky and heaven as we know it were conflated into one, and there were multiple layers|
                                        |(many say there were seven). Progressing through these layers, one goes from the atmosphere surrounding|
