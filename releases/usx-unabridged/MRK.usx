  <para style="ipi">According to church tradition, Mark is the one referred to as John-Mark, son of Mary, in Acts 15:37,
    to whose house Peter went after the angel freed him from the prison in Jerusalem. John-Mark is also the
    cousin of Barnabas. Some believe that his mother Mary is the one who furnished the upper room used for
    the Last Supper and also used on the day of Pentecost. Some believe that the “young man” whom Mark refers
    to in Mark 14:51,52 is none other than himself, corroborating the theories. But most agree that the “Mark
    my son” whom Peter refers to in 1 Pet. 5:13 is the same John-Mark and is the author of the Gospel of
    Mark.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Mark was not actually Peter’s son, but he was a close enough companion and brother that Peter claims
    him as his figurative son, not only a son in the faith but a son in relation. Church tradition says that
    Mark was Peter’s interpreter, likely interpreting Aramaic into Greek as Peter itinerated throughout the
    Roman Empire. Serving as Peter’s interpreter, Mark would re-tell the same stories over and over again.
    He also spent a lot of time with Peter, everything from travelling to dining. No doubt, Mark spoke to
    Peter a lot and asked many questions about the missing details of the life of Jesus.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Also according to church tradition, Peter was martyred in Rome. Mark was there at that time, and the
    brethren asked him to commit all of what Peter had told him over the years to a book. This book is the
    Gospel of Mark. Mark’s gospel is written to a Roman audience, so it does not dwell on things that would
    be interesting to a Jewish believer of the day who believed in the Messiah. Mark’s gospel is full of
    drama, action, encounters, confrontation. The teachings it contains are more down-to-earth than Matthew
    or Luke, though they are wrapped in analogy (parable) as Jesus taught them.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Mark’s Greek is simple. He does not have the command of the language that Luke and Paul do, and his Gospel
    makes repeated use of simple words rather than drawing on less common, more specific words. There’s rich
    detail in the description of characters that looks like it came straight from the mouth of Peter. It
    vividly paints a familiarity with the character. For example, the story of the woman with the hemorrhage,
    which begins in Mark 5:25. The details give us a clear picture of this woman’s ordeal:</para>
  <para style="iq">A woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, having suffered a great deal at the hands of many doctors,
    spending everything she had—and nothing was helping but instead things were trending more to the worse…</para>
  <para style="ipi">The details about the length of her affliction and how she had spent everything she had trying to find
    a cure leaves a stronger impression than if Mark had simply wrote, “there was a woman who had a really
    bad hemorrhage…”</para>
  <para style="ipi">Another example comes from the story of Herod and John the Baptist. Herod kept John locked up in jail,
    and with detail Mark supplies about Herod (Mark 6:19,20), one acquires a familiarity with Herod:</para>
  <para style="iq">So Herodias maintained a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and wasn’t yet able to do so,
    since, throughout, Herod had a reverential awe of John, knowing him to be an upstanding man, right in
    the eyes of God and holy, and was keeping him safe. After listening to him many times, he became conflicted,
    yet still enjoyed listening to him.</para>
  <para style="ipi">…the story continues after Herod’s stepdaughter finishes her dance. The silly girl “rejoined the party
    with hasty eagerness”; one can feel the glee coursing through her cruel, juvenile head.</para>
  <para style="iq">He swore up and down to her multiple times, “Whatever you ask me for, I’ll give it to you—anything you
    want—anything at all.” She excused herself and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother
    said, “John the Baptist’s head.” Straightaway she rejoined the party and with hasty eagerness said, “I
    want you to give me John the Baptist’s head on a platter—right now.”</para>
  <para style="ipi">On the other hand, Mark is loud, clumsy, and careless as a writer, in spite of apparently having a scribe
    work with him to proof-read his Greek and to translate words for obscure objects and the like. In spite
    of his simple use of Greek, the translator must pause and think what Mark meant to say. He over-uses
    the imperfect and present subjunctive tenses for effect. He uses <char style="it">and</char> when he
    should use <char style="it">or</char> and vice-versa (ex: Mark 11:28). He gets some simple events out
    of sequence, like Mark 12:8, where it literally reads, “They took him, killed him, and drove him outside
    of the vineyard.” As correlated with Matt. 21:39, he means, “They took him, drove him some place outside
    of the vineyard, and killed him there.” In other words, they first drove him out of the vineyard then
    killed him, not the other way around.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Modern criticism asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel first, then it became the basis for Matthew and Luke.
    The critics are quick to dismiss reports from early church witnesses who contradict this theory, and
    are slow to propose theories of how the commonality could have come about.</para>
  <para style="ipi">Another point of contention is the ending of Mark’s gospel, Mark 16:9–20. A footnote in a contemporary
    translation such as the NASB states that this ending is missing from two of the oldest manuscripts. Modern
    critics claim that the ending of Mark has been lost for all time, seizing upon this in their eagerness
    to poke holes in the integrity of the Scriptures. We do not have the detail of information we would like
    to solve this mystery, however there are enough fragments scattered over time to postulate a likely scenario.
    This is analogous to how the NTSB determines causes of crashes in smaller aircraft: they sift through
    the evidence and eliminate possibilities until they’re left with the “likely” cause of the crash. They
    cannot say with absolute certainty what caused the crash, but they can state with confidence what likely
    caused the accident.</para>
  <para style="ipi">In this train of thought, the mystery of the ending of Mark is likely explained in this way: the ending
    was intentionally truncated from certain manuscripts in the late third or early fourth centuries by order
    of one in authority, perhaps even Eusebius of Caesarea himself. The reason this person did so was because
    he refused to believe what was written in Mark 16:16-19. Ironically, these manuscripts, which are called
    the <char style="it">Alexandrian text-type</char>, are the most accurate in most every other respect
    to the originals, as the editors who produced them made a concerted effort to eradicate the false emendations
    (mostly insertions) which had accumulated over time in manuscripts everywhere, most likely in the second
    and third centuries, and they predate any false changes made in the fourth century and onwards. To a
    large extent, scholars in the 19<char style="sup">th</char> and 20<char style="sup">th</char> centuries,
    observing the faithfulness and accuracy of the hand of correction which guided the Alexandrian manuscripts,
    could not fathom that the same party who had corrected so many verses in the NT would be the one most
    instrumental in trashing the largest and most important disputed passage in the NT—but this is precisely
    what they did.</para>

        the Spirit himself is not like a dove. Pigeons are similar to doves, and are birds we are more familiar
        with. A pigeon flutters and flaps its wings as it lands on a spot in the park, but once it has landed,
        all the flapping and fluttering immediately ceases, and the pigeon then begins to walk slowly looking
        for food. So it was when the Spirit descended: a lot of activity and commotion, but once the Spirit came
        to rest on Jesus, the commotion ceased. But like the pigeon, the Spirit remained.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">freshly-squeezed grape juice…</char>Lit: <char style="it">new wine</char>. The Gk. word
        for wine means either grape juice (no preservatives, of course) or wine. The distinction in ancient times
        is that grape juice is simply wine which hasn’t fermented yet; freshly-squeezed grape juice will invariably
        ferment into wine (or vinegar if not done properly). The fermentation of the juice into wine yields gases,
        and since the skins are sealed shut, such gases cause an increase in pressure, which causes a new skin
        to stretch, and therefore the total volume in the sealed container to increase, thereby reducing the
        pressure. Old skins, those which have been used once already for making wine, have been stretched fully
        and do not shrink after the wine has been poured out of them. When grape juice is fermented in them a
        second time, since they have already been stretched to their maximum extent, and are not capable of stretching
        any more, the pressure buildup from the second fermentation cannot be relieved and causes the skins to
        burst.</char>

        Although many interpret <char style="it">rock </char>to mean stability, the meaning of <char style="it">rock
        </char>as revealed in the NT (ref. Matt 16:18, Eph. 2:20) is a foundation to build upon, which specifically
        points to a foundational leadership position in the Church. This list of apostles here in Mark 3 ranks
        them according to the preeminence Jesus assigns to them. Therefore, in listing Peter first and giving
        him the name Peter (”the rock”), Jesus has made Peter the first among his disciples and the one who’ll
        lead the early church after his ascension.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">No one can enter the strong man’s house unless he first binds the tough guy</char>…Jesus
        stated this in the context of the way Satan and his demons operate. This verse is one of the most important
        rules for understanding how demons take hold of people. What Jesus is saying is that it is not possible
        for demons to simply approach someone and take control of them, believers and unbelievers alike. In order
        for evil spirits to get any sort of control over a person, they must break that person’s will first.
        Breaking their will is “binding the strong man.” Only then, can they “enter the strong man’s house.”
        A person who is fully demon-possessed has had his willpower systematically broken, and for this reason,
        someone must cast the demon out of him, since he has not the willpower to do it himself. However, any
        believer can simply exercise his will and authority in Christ and drive any demonic influence from himself.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">blaspheme the Holy Spirit…</char>Jesus says that this one sin called “the blasphemy
        of the Holy Spirit” is unforgiveable. Jesus spoke of the same thing in Matt. 12:32 (ref. note there).
        What exactly, then, is the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit? The answer is in plain sight, as Jesus was insinuating
        that the Scribes had committed this sin, and what the Scribes did is specified in v.30. Here the Scribes
        could see the miracles of Jesus, and they attributed them to the devil. Believing in miracles does not
        require the amount of faith as believing in something which is unseen does. The hardness of heart that
        denies the undeniable will never turn to God and will therefore never receive forgiveness, ever.</char>

        to the Jews but has transgressed into a state of uncleanness, temporarily (like in the case of unclean

        and forbidden, and there were rules for restoring something which is unclean to clean. These rules should
        have been derived from the Law of Moses, but tradition was introduced alongside, and in cases supplanted,
        the Law of Moses, and this supplanting is what Jesus has issue with.</char>

        came to the house to get away from the crowds, because he needed a break. Then this Syro-Phoenician woman
        arrived and spoiled this respite. Jesus tells her that the Gentiles are a lower priority than the Jews:
        the children referred to in v.27 are the Israelites; the children’s bread is Jesus’s miraculous ministry;
        the children will “eat until they’re full,” then the Gentiles (the “dogs”) can take their turn. Her response
        is that the dogs eat at the same time as the children, not afterwards. Her faith got her the crumbs she
        was looking for.</char>

        reference that casting out evil spirits is contingent on fasting. Such false manuscript insertions (Mark
        9:29, 1 Cor. 7:5, Matt. 6:13, Mark 9:44) follow a pattern: years after the NT books were written, a few
        religious-minded folks read such passages and felt that God’s Word was not severe enough, or pious enough,
        or austere enough; or fearful of evil forces enough, and needed them to doctor it a bit.</char>

        By using the present tense here in <char style="it">is being handed over</char>, Jesus is summarizing

        sense, because of the disagreement in plurality, specifically that one cup of water is being offered
        to “you all”: several people. This leads to the conclusion that the Gk. phrase for giving a cup of water
        is an idiomatic expression, the meaning of which is obvious. In addition, there is some disagreement
        in the manuscripts for the words <char style="it">by name</char> (or, as others assume, <char style="it">in
        name</char>). Some manuscripts have changed <char style="it">in name </char>to <char style="it">in his

        such, a secondary translation of <char style="it">in name </char>was chosen, one found in the OT: <char

        copied this over to vv. 44 and 46. Ref. note of v.41. In any case, <char style="it">their worm</char>
        here is a plural adjective modifying a singular noun; therefore, the “worm” referred to here is likely
        a bodily ailment, a parasitic infestation of worms, something like tapeworms or roundworms (ascariasis).
        In his short description of hell in v. 48, Jesus says that those in hell have worm infestations on the
        inside and are surrounded by fire on the outside. As the symptoms of a worm infestation include (but
        are not limited to) nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, weight loss, general weakness,
        Jesus was saying that those in hell experience these symptoms.</char>

        For v. 49, some manuscripts read, <char style="it">for all sacrifices will be salted with salt. </char>Though
        this alternate reading has been rejected as spurious, the authors’ instincts for the true interpretation
        of these verses should not be. Therefore, the assumption is that v. 49 speaks of meats being seasoned
        with salt while being roasted, with salt added as a preservative. Verse 50 reads, <char style="it">as
        you have salt embedded in yourselves</char>. This becomes a metaphor; believers are compared to a hunk
        of meat which is roasted over a fire, having salt applied to them. After the roasting is complete, they
        have the salt in themselves, which means that they have the preservative effects of it. This affect is
        what allows them to live in peace with one another.</char>

        Christ. It is the truth indeed, but such a truth he will only hear spoken by his Father. Second, he is
        still under the grand trial appointed to him by his Father, which will only be complete after his crucifixion.
        In his humility, he doesn’t consider himself to have earned the title of ‘good’ yet, and won’t until
        he’s raised from the dead. At that time, his Father will call him good, and not he call himself good.</char>

        fig season and as a result cursed the tree. Why did Jesus expect to find figs on a tree when it wasn’t
        fig season? There are two times a year in which a fig tree bears figs. The main crop is in the late summer
        or fall and a secondary crop (called a <char style="it">breba</char>) is in the spring. The breba crop
        comes from shoots from the previous fall’s crop. Also, over the winter a fig tree will shed leaves. New
        leaves grow back in the spring, and this is what the phrase <char style="it">in leaf</char> refers to
        in v. 13. Also, the appearance of these new leaves coincides with the breba crop; hence, Jesus saw the
        new leaves and expected to see figs. When Mark said in v.13 that “figs weren’t in season,” he’s referring
        to the fall crop, not the breba crop.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">Have the God-kind of faith…</char>Lit:<char style="it"> Be-having faith of-God</char>.
        A couple of relevant facts concerning the Gk. grammar in this short statement. First, the verb tense
        (present) of <char style="it">have </char>insinuates not just having once and being done with it but
        having continuously. Second, the lack of the definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>is
        conspicuous and was omitted intentionally by Mark. As a point of contrast, consider the example of Acts
        3:16, where the definite article is used before <char style="it">faith</char> (and this in a prepositional
        phrase, which often omits an expected definite article). In the case of v. 22 here, the omission of the
        definite article emphasizes the nature of the faith. Furthermore, the word <char style="it">God </char>is
        in the genitive case, but when a possessive is constructed in Gk. (an example in English would be, “This
        is Mary’s jar,” where <char style="it">Mary </char>appears in the possessive form), it normally consists
        of the definite article first, followed by the noun, followed by perhaps another article, then the genitive
        form of the noun doing the possessing. Since the initial definite article is missing, this disrupts the
        normal pattern of a Gk. possessive form, and signals a different meaning to the reader. Third, the lack
        of definite article before <char style="it">faith </char>emphasizes the nature of the faith.</char>

        darkness progress from sunset to the middle of the night, just before daybreak, and finally to daybreak.

        at sunset, whether in the middle of the night, whether just before daybreak, whether daybreak</char>.
        His point is to cover the entire night, from beginning to end, starting when it begins to get dark and
        ending when it’s still a bit dark in the morning.</char>

      <char style="ft"><char style="it">But the point that I’m making in this story applies to you all as well</char>…In this
        parable, the servants are all assigned responsibilities, and their responsibilities by default include
        keeping watch during the day, as they’ll be up and about minding shop during daylight hours, but do not
        included keeping watch at night. The job of keeping the night watch is assigned solely to the doorman.
        If the estate owner were to come in the middle of the night and catch everyone asleep, it will be the
        doorman’s fault and not the servants’, since the servants are expected to sleep at night. The doorman
        is the lowest ranking servant on the estate (the Gk. word for <char style="it">doorman </char>is alternatively
        translated <char style="it">porter</char> or <char style="it">janitor</char>); the servants are assigned
        more important duties. The doorman’s temptation is to neglect his night watch duties, as the servants,
        those senior to him, will sleep through the night and therefore not keep tabs on him. The admonition
        Jesus makes is for the doorman (and us by extension) to stay alert every night, throughout the entire
        night, as the estate owner could come at any time.</char>

        Mark was the son of Mary, who owned the upper room where the Last Supper was held. Mark wasn’t one of

      <char style="ft">Those who deny that vv. 9–20 are genuine build their argument not on the manuscript evidence (which is
        certainly not in their favor) but instead on “internal” evidence, i.e. whether they think these verses
        fit Mark’s style of writing and his use of vocabulary. Their claims:</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(a) <char style="it">Mary Magdalene, whom he had cast out seven demons</char> (v.9). They claim that
        the writer is introducing Mary Magdalene here, noting the demons cast out of her, but in fact she had
        been referred to just a few times in the preceding verses and chapters.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(b) Some words occur in this passage that Mark doesn’t use anywhere else</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(c) The writing is simply not Mark’s style</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">Let us look at these claims in detail.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">First, Mark mentions that Mary Magdalene had had seven demons cast out of her. Any forger would know
        that Mary Magdalene was brought up in v.1 and would’ve written accordingly. But the extra statement of
        her having demons cast out is not an introduction but a reminder of the grace she had received, resulting
        in a tender heart which caused her to be the first to believe when the others wouldn’t. To emphasize
        this, Mark, when he said <char style="it">had cast out</char>, chose to use the Gk. perfect tense over
        the aorist for emphasis. In support of this, v.10 begins with the words <char style="it">that lady</char>,
        which invites the reader to detach himself and ponder her history. The other women weren’t address in
        that fashion.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">Second, there are a few words which Mark uses in this passage that don’t appear elsewhere in his book
        (never mind the fact that every chapter of Mark has unique words used in its chapter which Mark uses
        nowhere else). Let us look at these words:</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(i) <char style="it">Accompany</char> (v.17). This is a more specific word that pre-pends the word <char
        style="it">with </char>to <char style="it">follow. </char>Certainly Mark knew the meaning of this word.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(ii) <char style="it">Serpent</char> (v.18). A common word.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(iii) <char style="it">Hurt</char> (v.18). Ranks 2808<char style="sup">th</char> out of 5394, where 1
        is most common and 5394 is least. This word is uncommon.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(iv) <char style="it">Poison</char> (v.18). Derived from a very common root.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(v) The phrase <char style="it">so then</char> (v. 19). Two extremely common words used as a phrase.
        Mark certainly knew the meaning of the phrase, but didn’t use it anywhere else.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(vi) <char style="it">Working alongside</char> (v.20). This is the verb form of the commonly-used noun
        <char style="it">fellow-worker.</char></char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">(vii) <char style="it">Confirm</char> (v.20). Appears as 2803<char style="sup">rd</char> out of 5394.
        This word is uncommon and is not derived from a commonly used root.</char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">We can strike serpent, hurt, and poison from the list, since there are no alternatives for these words;
        Mark would’ve asked the scribe who was doing the actual writing to supply these words had he not known
        them and when he had need of them. This leaves four words, three of which are common, and Mark certainly
        knew, but he hadn’t used before. The list of uncommon words is whittled down to the single word <char
        style="it">confirm.</char></char>
      <char style="fp"></char>
      <char style="ft">As far as the style is concerned—and this is quite open-ended—true, Mark shifts his preference in verb
        tenses around, but this passage has little story-telling narrative. Another thing to note are the figures
        of speech used in vv.15,16. Would a forgerer risk using a figure or speech? Would a forgerer dwell on
        the disciples not believing when they should have (vv.13,14). While all these things with style are debatable,
        they are not definitive in determining whether the long ending of vv.9–20 is spurious or not.</char>
