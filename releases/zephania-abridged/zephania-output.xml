      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/>Jacob had Joseph, Mary’s husband, …and from her was born Jesus,
        who’s called “the Christ.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">In total, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David; there were
        fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian captivity; there were fourteen generations
        from the Babylonian captivity to Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18"><BR art="x-nl"/>The Way Jesus’s Birth Was After Mary was engaged but before
        she was officially married to Joseph—and before she was intimate with him—she found that she
        was pregnant, and that it was from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Her husband Joseph, being someone who always did the right thing and not wanting
        to disgrace Mary, decided to himself that he’d quietly break up with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20"><BR art="x-nl"/>After he talked himself into doing this—of all things—an angel
        sent from the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,“Joseph, you marvelous godsend, don’t
        be afraid to keep Mary as your wife; what she’s conceived in fact came from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She’ll give birth to a son, and you’re going to name him ‘Jesus’, since he will
        indeed deliver the people from their sins.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All of this has happened in order to fulfill the prophecy which came through
        the Prophet Isaiah, which says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23"><BR art="x-nl"/>Check this out! Our virgin here will get pregnant and give birth
        to a son, And they’ll call him Emmanuel (which translated means “God with us”)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Joseph woke up from the dream and did just as he was told to do by the angel
        sent from God and kept Mary as his wife</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and didn’t sleep with her until after she’d given birth to the son, whom he
        named Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Matthew chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the province of Judea, during the days
        of King Herod, out of nowhere these gurus called “magii” who came from the East and showed up
        in Jerusalem</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">going about saying, “Where’s that child-king of the Jews? The fact is, we saw
        his star while over in the East and came to worship him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Hearing about this made King Herod queasy, along with everyone else in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So he gathered the chief priests and the designated teachers called scribes and
        quizzed them to find out exactly where the Messiah would be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They told him, “In Bethlehem, Judea, since it’s been written about by the Prophet
        Micah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>”And for you, Bethlehem, Judea,
        by no means Do you come in last placeIn the Judean power rankings;For out of you will come a
        ruler who’ll lead my people Israel”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod stealthily summoned the magii and ascertained from them the time of
        the star’s appearance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and sent them to Bethlehem telling them, “Go ask around and gather all the facts
        you can about this child. Then after you find him, come tell me so that I can come and worship
        him too.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having heard this from the king, they went out and—just like that—the same star
        which they saw back east took the lead in front of them until it reached the place where the
        child was and then stood still up over that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Seeing what the star had done, they got really excited.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary and fell flat
        on their faces and worshipped him. Then they opened their chests and delivered gifts to him,
        gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And having received a divine instruction given through a dream to not return
        to Herod but instead to take another way out, they left to go back to their homeland.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now after they had departed, just like that an angel appeared in a dream to
        Joseph telling him, “Get up, grab the child and his mother, and run for your life to Egypt. Stay
        there until I tell you. Herod, you see, is going about seeking to eliminate the child.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and left for Egypt under the cover
        of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he stayed there until Herod passed away, in order that the prophet Hosea’s
        prophecy would be fulfilled, which says, “From out of Egypt I summoned my son.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when Herod realized that he’d been tricked by the magii, he got really angry
        and had all the children in Bethlehem and all the surrounding areas eliminated, from two and
        under, consistent with the time which he’d ascertained from the magii.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">It was then that the prophet Jeremiah’s prophecy was fulfilled, which says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>A sound was
        heard in Ramah— Weeping and wailing—Rachel crying over her childrenAnd she wasn’t wanting to
        be comforted,Since they’re gone for good</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After Herod died—just like that—an angel sent from the Lord appeared in a dream
        to Joseph while in Egypt</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20"><BR art="x-nl"/>saying, “Get up and take the child and his mother and go to
        Israel, now that those who’ve been craving to snuff out the child’s life are finally dead.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he got up and took the child and his mother and entered the country of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But since he heard that Archelaos had replaced his father as king of Judea,
        he was afraid to go over there. Getting instructions through a dream, he detoured over to the
        Galilean area,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and when he got there, he settled in a city called Nazareth, in order that what
        the prophets had prophesied would be fulfilled, that he would be considered to be a Nazarene.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Matthew chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now back in those days, John the Baptist appeared on the scene in the Judean
        countryside</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, “Straighten up and change your ways, since God’s involvement with mankind
        (the kingdom of heaven) just got here!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>You see, what’s taking
        place here is the prophecy from Isaiah which says, The sound of shouting in the countryside:“Block
        off the road the Lord will take!Barricade the streets he’ll be on!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">John dressed himself in a camel-hair outfit wrapped in a leather belt, and his
        diet consisted of grasshoppers and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">At that time everybody in Jerusalem and Judea and everybody from around the Jordan
        kept coming out to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were one after another being baptized in the Jordan River by him while
        pouring their hearts out in confessing their sins out loud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Seeing that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were showing up at his baptism,
        he said to them, “You nest of vipers, who convinced you to run for your lives because of the
        coming wrath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Have the change in lifestyle which goes hand-in-hand with the commitment to a
        change in ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And while discussing this among yourselves, don’t say, ‘We’re descendants of
        Abraham.’ Oh yes—I tell you, God is able to turn these stones here into descendants of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The axe is lying next to the tree trunk and is ready to be used: Every tree
        which isn’t yielding good fruit will be chopped down and tossed into a fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Me—I baptize in water towards the goal of repentance, but the one who’ll come
        after me is greater than me; I’m not worthy enough to carry him around by the soles of his shoes.
        But him—he’ll baptize in a fiery manifestation of the Holy Spirit—which words fall short to describe;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">with the winnowing fork in his hand, he’ll clear everything off his threshing
        floor too. He’ll store his wheat in the silo but will burn up the chaff with a fire that will
        never be put out.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus appeared on the scene in the Jordan region, coming from Galilee,
        to get with John, to be baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John brushed him off saying, “It’s me who needs to be baptized by you, but
        you’re approaching me instead?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus formulated a reply and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Let’s go through
        with it. This way, no doubt, it’ll be noted by us all that all the requirements were fulfilled.”
        </STYLE>He then permitted it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was being baptized, he came straight up out of the water, and—of all
        things—the sky opened up, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And—of all things—a voice spoke from the sky saying, “This one here is my Beloved
        Son, and I’m quite pleased with him.”</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Matthew chapter 3 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Jesus was guided by the Spirit into the countryside to be tempted by the
        devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After fasting for forty days and nights, he finally became hungry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3"><BR art="x-nl"/>and the Tempter came by and said, “If your position is indeed
        Son of God, speak so that these stones become bread.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR
        art="x-nl"/>“It’s written,Man will not live by bread only,But by every word coming out of the
        mouth of God”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the devil then took him to the holy city, and placed him on the battlements
        on the temple roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR
        art="x-nl"/>He turned and, in continuation, said, “If you’re indeed God’s son, jump off. I mean,
        it’s written,Where you are concerned,He’ll issue orders for His angels to follow.They’ll even
        lift you up by putting you on their hands,Lest your foot impact a stone.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus declared to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“But again it’s written, ‘You
        shall not vet the Lord your God, applying a test to determine whether He passes or fails.’”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So again the devil took him to a really high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms
        of the world and their glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, “All of these I’ll give to you, if you would fall and worship me.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Jesus, finishing the conversation, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR
        art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>“Depart, Satan! In regard to this, it’s written,You will
        worship the Lord GodAnd offer spiritual service to Him alone”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left him, and—then and there—some angels came and attended to
        him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Once he heard that John had been taken into custody, he withdrew to Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After leaving Nazareth for good, he took up residence in Capernaum-on-the-Sea
        in the region of Zebulon and Naphtali,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that Isaiah’s prophecy might be fulfilled, which says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>In the land of Zebulon and in the land of Naphtali
        On the road leading to the sea, on the other side of the JordanIn the region of Galilee—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>The folk sitting in darkness
        saw a great light, And for the ones sitting in a region Where they were under the shadow of deathA
        light shined on them</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>Starting then, Jesus began to go about and proclaim
        openly, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>Straighten up and change your
        ways,Since God’s involvement with mankind (the kingdom of heaven)Just got here!</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While sauntering down the Sea of Galilee coastline, he saw two brothers, Simon,
        whom they call Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting fishing nets into the sea, since they were
        fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Be my disciples, and I’ll make
        you fishermen who fish for men.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right away they quit being fishermen and became his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Continuing on from there, he saw another pair of brothers, James son of Zebedee
        and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their fishing nets. He called
        them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Right away they left the boat and their father and became his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He began to go about the entire region of Galilee teaching in the synagogues
        and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and treatingany kind of and all sorts of diseases
        and any kind of and all sorts of maladies among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">News of him spread throughout the whole region of Syria. They brought to him
        all kinds of people having something wrong with them…various kinds of sicknesses, those suffering
        or in pain, the demon-possessed, epileptics, paralytics…and he treated everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Large crowds from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, the Jordan, and from the other
        side of the Jordan followed him around.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Matthew chapter 4 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now seeing the crowds, he hiked up the mountains, and upon seating himself, his
        disciples came to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">He said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Go into the city to so-and-so and ask him,
        ‘The Teacher says, “I’ll soon be ready for my disciples and me to observe the Passover at your

      <VERS vnumber="19">The disciples did what Jesus told them to do and made preparations for the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When evening came, he was at the table with the Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">While they were eating, he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m telling you
        the truth—one of you all will betray me.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Being deeply grieved, they started telling him over and over, each one of them,
        “No way it’s me, right Lord?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He came up with a reply and said, “<STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Whoever raises
        his glass to offer a toast—this is the guy who’ll betray me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">While, indeed, the Man follows the trajectory defined
        for him in Scripture, on the other hand, there are bad things in store for that fellow who’ll
        betray him: that guy would be better off if he’d never been born.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Judas, his betrayer, responded, “No way it’s me, right Teacher?” Jesus, engaged
        by the remark, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“You said <STYLE fs="italic">it</STYLE>, <STYLE
        fs="italic">not me.</STYLE>”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, offered up thanksgiving,
        and broke it and gave it to his disciples and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Take <STYLE fs="italic">it</STYLE>
        and eat <STYLE fs="italic">it</STYLE>: this is my body.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He took a cup, offered up thanksgiving, and gave it to them saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“All

      <VERS vnumber="28"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant,

      <VERS vnumber="30">After they sang some hymns, they departed for the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Jesus said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR

      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter responded to the statement and replied, “Even if everyone else falls out
        with you, I never will.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m telling you, this very night
        you will deny me before a rooster crows three times.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter, in line with what he’d been told, said to him, “Even if I have to die
        together with you, I’ll definitely not deny you.” All the other disciples said the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and prompts the disciples,
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Sit here somewhere until I’m done praying over there.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and to
        be in anguish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Engaging them in conversation, he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My
        soul is thoroughly grieved to the point of death: stay here with me and stay alert.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He ventured out a bit and fell on his face in prayer saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My
        Father, if it’s possible, let this ordeal pass by and go away from me; nevertheless, not what
        I want but what you <STYLE fs="italic">want</STYLE>.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He went to his disciples and found them sleeping, and he, sizing things up,
        said to Peter, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“You all didn’t have the strength to stay focused with
        me for a short period of time?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Stay focused and keep praying, so that you don’t

      <VERS vnumber="42">Again, a second time, he went out to pray saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My

        to not drink <STYLE fs="italic">of</STYLE> it), let Your will come to pass.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He came again and found them sleeping, as their eyelids had grown heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Leaving them again, he went out to pray, saying the same thing for the third
        time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then he went to his disciples and, continuing to engage them, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Have
        you been sleeping in the meantime, getting rested up?…See now, the moment has arrived and the

      <VERS vnumber="46"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Get up, let’s get going!—Look! My betrayer has arrived!”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">While he was still speaking, at once Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived with
        a large crowd, with swords and clubs, sent from the high priest and the councilmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">His betrayer arranged ahead of time for there to be a signal saying, “Whomever
        I kiss, he’s the one; seize him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">He went straight over to Jesus and said, “Delighted to see you, Teacher!”, and
        kissed him cordially”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“What brings you here, bro?”</STYLE>
        They then went over and laid their hands on Jesus and apprehended him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, like that, one of the people who were with Jesus drew his sword and struck
        the high priest’s slave, slicing his ear off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Put your sword back where
        it belongs; you see, everyone who draws a sword <STYLE fs="italic">in order to use it </STYLE>will
        perish by a sword.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Or, do you suppose that I don’t have the ability

      <VERS vnumber="54"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">So now, how would all those verses in the Old Testament
        be fulfilled that say that things have to turn out this way?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">At that hour Jesus said to the crowd, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“You came out
        to apprehend me with swords and clubs like you were cornering a thug. Day after day I was sitting
        in the temple teaching and you didn’t seize me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">All of this happened so that Old Testament prophecies
        would be fulfilled.”</STYLE> Then all the disciples abandoned him and began to flee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">They took Jesus into custody and led him to the high priest Caiaphas, where
        the designated teachers and councilmen had gathered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Peter followed him at a distance all the way to the high priest’s courtyard
        and entered it and sat with the attendants in order to see how things would turn out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">The high priests and the entire Council were trying to find those who would
        give false, compelling testimony under oath against Jesus, so that they could have him killed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">and, while many were stepping forward and saying phony things in court, they
        couldn’t find any. But finally two came forward</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">and said, ”This is the guy who said, ‘I can tear down God’s temple and build
        it back up in three days’ time’.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">The high priest stood up and said to him, “You have nothing to say in response?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Jesus kept silent. The high priest said to him, “For the love of God, I
        charge you to testify here before us if you are the Messiah, the Christ, the Son of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Jesus, in full awareness, told them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Whatever. But
        one thing I’ll tell you <STYLE fs="italic">is this</STYLE>: From here on out, you will see, ‘The
        Man in his role as an all-powerful right-hand man and see him coming upon the clouds of the sky’.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest got unglued and in a rage starting breaking things, all
        the while saying, “He just blasphemed! Why do we need to hear any more testimony? You all heard
        him blaspheme here!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What have you decided?” They replied, “We sentence him to death.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">They then spat in his face and beat him. They slapped him while</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">saying, “Prophesy for us, Messiah: who slapped you?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the teen servant-girls
        went up to him and said, “Weren’t you with Jesus of Galilee too?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">He denied it in front of everyone saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking
        about.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">After he left through the entrance gate, another servant girl saw him and told
        those nearby, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Again he denied it, swearing, “I don’t know the man.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">A little while later, those who were standing nearby confronted Peter, “Seriously—you
        too are one of them, since you too talk with the same accent.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then he began to cuss and swear up and down, “I don’t know the man.” Immediately
        a rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="75">And Peter remembered what Jesus had said, that before a rooster sounded off
        he would deny him three times, and he left that place weeping bitterly.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At the break of day, all of the high priests and the councilmen met in a council
        that was convened against Jesus in order to have him killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">They tied him up, transferred him to the governor Pilate, and thereby placed
        him in his custody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the traitor Judas, seeing that he was condemned, changed his mind and returned
        the thirty coins to the high priests and the councilmen</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">saying, “It’s a sin to betray the blood of an innocent man.” They said, “What
        do we care? That’s your problem.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He tossed the money into the collection box for the temple fund, departed, and
        went out and hung himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The chief priests took the money and said, “We’re not allowed to put this into
        the temple fund, since it’s a blood payment.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They had a meeting over it, took the money, and bought the potter’s field with
        it, to be used as a graveyard for foreigners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this reason, that field’s called the Blood Field nowadays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>Only then was the Prophet Jeremiah’s

      <VERS vnumber="11">Now Jesus was made to appear before the governor, and the governor, in his inquisition,
        asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Whatever
        you say.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He made no defense against the accusations put forth by the chief priests and
        councilmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate, continuing with the questioning, said to him, “Don’t you hear how
        severe the charges are that they’re accusing you of?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He wouldn’t say a word in reply; as a result, the governor was stupefied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">According to a holiday custom, the governor would release one prisoner, any
        prisoner that the crowd wanted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">At that time they had interned a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While they were conferring amongst themselves, Pilate took the opportunity to
        say to them, “Who do you want me to set free, Barabbas or Jesus, who’s called the Messiah?”,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">since he knew that it was because of their jealousy that they’d handed him over
        to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While he was there presiding as judge, his wife sent him word saying, “Don’t
        get mixed up with that do-gooder, since I’ve been really upset all day because of a dream I had
        about him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and the councilmen persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas,

      <VERS vnumber="21"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>Having considered the matter, the governor said

      <VERS vnumber="22"><BR art="x-nl"/>Not quitting, Pilate said, “What shall I do then with Jesus,
        who’s called the Messiah?” But making no difference, they all said, “Let him be crucified!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23"><BR art="x-nl"/>He said, “Just what has he done wrong?” But they began to yell
        louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Seeing that nothing was helping, but instead a riot was forming, he took some
        water and washed his hands in it in front of the crowd saying, “Don’t blame me for this man’s

      <VERS vnumber="25">And everyone in the crowd responded, “Let the blame fall on us and our children!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he set Barabbas free, but he flogged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus to where the governor’s palace guard
        assembled, and the entire unit of guards descended on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They stripped his clothes from him and put a red soldier’s cloak around him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and they wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head and put a stick in
        his right hand, and they got down on their knees in front of him and toyed with him saying, “Delighted
        to see you, King of the Jews.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They spat on him and took the stick and began to hit his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When they were finished making fun of him, they took the cloak off him, put
        his clothes back on him, and led him forth to crucifixion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">While heading out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they conscripted
        this fellow to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Having arrived at a place called Golgotha, which is called the Skull Place,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">they gave him wine mixed with a bitter spice to drink, and when he tasted it,
        he didn’t want to drink any more of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So they crucified him, rolled dice to divvy up his clothes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">took a seat, and proceeded to keep track of him there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They put a sign indicating the reason for his crucifixion over his head which
        read, “This is Jesus, King of the Jews.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">At that time, there were two thugs crucified with him, one to the right of him
        and one to the left of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Those who came by reviled him, nodding their heads back and forth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">and saying, “The one who’ll supposedly destroy the temple and rebuild it in
        three days…Save yourself, if you’re God’s son…Let him come down from the cross.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">In the same way, the chief priests, along with the designated teachers and the
        Pharisees, taunted him saying over and over,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">”He rescued others but he can’t rescue himself…So, he’s the King of Israel…Let’s
        see him come down from the cross now, and we’ll believe in him…</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He placed his trust in God; let Him rescue him now if He wants him, since he

      <VERS vnumber="44">Likewise, the thugs who were selected to be crucified with him insulted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Starting at noon, darkness came over the whole earth, lasting until three in

      <VERS vnumber="46">Around three, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Eli,

      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest of the people there proceeded to say, “Let’s see if Elijah comes and

      <VERS vnumber="50">Again Jesus cried out in a loud voice and gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And—just like that—the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the
        rocks were shaken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and the tombs were opened up and many faithful believers who had died were resurrected,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">and with his resurrection left the tombs and went into the holy city and appeared

      <VERS vnumber="54">The captain of the guard and those who were keeping track of Jesus with him,
        seeing the earthquake and all the things that had happened, became really frightened, saying,
        “This guy really was the embodiment of a son of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Now there were many women there who came to watch the affair from a distance,
        some of whom had been Jesus’s followers from the Galilean days, attending to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Among them was Mary Magdalene, James’s and Joseph’s mother Mary, and the mother
        of the sons of Zebedee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">At sunset a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself had also been
        discipled by Jesus—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">This fellow approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. Pilate then ordered
        for it to be given away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">placed it in his newly-made tomb, which had been hewn into the rock, rolled
        a huge stone over to the tomb’s entrance, and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">Now, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sat down across from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">That night, which is a day of preparation for the festival, the chief priests
        and the Pharisees got together and went to Pilate</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">and said, “Sir, we remember what that grifter said while he was still alive,
        that he would be resurrected after three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Therefore, give the order that the tomb be kept secure under guard from now
        until the third day comes, lest his disciples come and steal his bodyand tell the people, “He
        rose from the dead”; a final such deception would be worse than any deceiving he did before.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said to them, “You’ll get your guard; go out and secure it the best you
        know how.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">So they went and secured the tomb, having fortified the rock as it stood against

      <VERS vnumber="1">After the back-to-back Sabbaths had ended, at the first light of day on Sunday,

      <VERS vnumber="2">Wouldn’t you know—a huge convulsion had occurred; in fact, an angel sent from
        the Lord descended from out of the sky, went over to the stone, rolled it away, and sat down
        on top of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His appearance resembled lightning, and his outerwear was as white as snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Terrified of him, those keeping guard trembled violently until finally becoming
        as stiff as the dead, laid out on the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The angel summed the situation up and said to the women, “Don’t be afraid, since
        I know that you’re looking for Jesus, the one who was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He’s not here, since he was resurrected just like he said he would be: go look

      <VERS vnumber="4">John the Baptist came on the scene in the countryside preaching a baptism—a water
        immersion-type of initiation ceremony—signifying a total commitment to a change in conduct to
        live the right way and signifying an initiation into a forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">All of the Judean region and everyone in Jerusalem were coming out and were being
        baptized by him in the Jordan River, one after another, while pouring their hearts out in confessing
        their sins out loud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">John dressed himself in a camel hair outfit wrapped in a leather belt and for
        food ate grasshoppers and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He preached, “One’s coming after me who’s greater than me, for whom I’m not worthy
        of bending over and unfastening one of the straps on his sandals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Me—I baptize in water, but he—he’ll baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus of Nazareth, Galilee came on the scene in those days and was baptized by
        John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As he came straight up out of the water, he saw the sky parting and the Spirit
        descending upon him like a dove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A voice spoke from out of the sky, “You are my Beloved Son. I’m quite pleased
        with you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Immediately the Spirit drove him into the countryside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He was out there in the middle of nowhere for forty days, being tempted by Satan.
        He was fighting for his life, and all the while the angels were attending to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After John had been taken into custody, Jesus came to Galilee preaching God’s
        message of good news,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and saying that the time had arrived and that God’s involvement with you (God’s
        kingdom) had drawn near; and saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Go about changing your ways
        and believing in the Good News.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While passing by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting
        a net, seeing that they were fishermen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Come be my followers, and I’ll
        make you into fishermen who fish for men.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Right away they left their nets and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He continued onwards a bit further and saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother
        John, while they were in the boat mending the nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Right away he called out to them, and they left their father Zebedee in the
        boat with the hired hands and departed to be his followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They came to Capernaum, and without delay he started teaching in the synagogue
        there on the Sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They were amazed at his teaching, since he was teaching in a captivating manner,
        and not like their designated teachers, the Scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In an instant, there was a man right there in their synagogue with a demonic
        spirit, and he screamed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">”We have no beef with you, Jesus of Nazareth; did you come to annihilate us?
        I know who you are: you’re the Holy One of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus sternly took charge over him saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Shut
        up and come out of him!”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The demonic spirit shook him real good, cried out in a loud voice, and then
        exited him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Everyone was amazed, to the extent that they began to discuss and argue among
        themselves, “Just who is this guy?…Fresh teaching delivered in a captivating manner…He even takes
        charge over demonic spirits, and they obey him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Immediately, the news about him spread to everyone in the entire area surrounding
        Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Right after leaving the synagogue, they went with James and John to Simon and
        Andrew’s house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Simon’s mother-in-law was laid out with a fever, and immediately they spoke
        to Jesus about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He went over to her, took her hand, pulled her up, and the fever left, and she
        began to attend to their needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When it was late in the day and the sun was setting, they began to bring him
        all those having something wrong with them and the demon-possessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The whole city gathered at the door,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and he healed many of those who had something wrong with them consisting of
        a disease of one kind or another, and cast out many demons, and while casting them out wasn’t
        letting the demons say anything, because they knew who he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Early in the morning, before daybreak, he left and went out to a place where
        nobody was around and prayed and prayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Simon and those with him went out to hunt him down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They found him and, engaging him in conversation, said, “Everyone’s looking
        for you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Continuing the conversation, he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Let’s go somewhere
        else, to an area where there’s towns <STYLE fs="italic">in the vicinity</STYLE>.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They went throughout all of Galilee preaching in the synagogues there and casting
        out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">A leper approached him, pleading with him, “If you so desire, you can purge
        this disease from me.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He had pity on him, extended his hand, touched him, and pronounces, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I
        do so desire; be purged of this disease.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Immediately it left him; he was purged of the disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Without wasting any time, he sternly and with an inner indignation gave him
        specific instructions and then cut him loose,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">telling him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Make sure you don’t say anything to
        anyone about this, but go your way and show yourself to the priest and bring along with you the

      <VERS vnumber="45"><BR art="x-nl"/>But he departed and began going around enthusiastically telling
        lots of people what had happened and spreading the story and its acclamation around, resulting
        in him no longer being able to enter a city, but instead having to stay outside in the countryside.And
        they began to come to him from every direction.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Mark chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Several days after entering Capernaum, word got out that he was staying in a
        house there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many converged on it, to the extent that nobody could get in or out of the door
        anymore, and he kept on speaking the word of God to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Four men arrived carrying a stretcher that had someone who was paralyzed on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Not being able to carry him through the crowd, they pulled away the roof where
        he was and dug out a hole in order to lower the stretcher on which the paralyzed fellow was lying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the one paralyzed, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Son,
        your sins are forgiven.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some of the designated teachers were sitting there mulling this over in their
        hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">”How can he talk that way to this guy? He’s blaspheming; who’s able to forgive
        sins, except for the one-and-only God?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Immediately coming to the realization in his spirit exactly what they had thought
        up, Jesus engages them in conversation, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Why did you, inside of yourselves,
        think these things up?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">What’s easier to say to the one paralyzed, ‘Your sins
        are forgiven,’ or, ‘Get up, take your stretcher, and walk around’?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">But so that you would know that the Man has the authority
        on earth to forgive sins…” </STYLE>he turns and speaks to the paralyzed fellow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">”…I say to you, pick up your stretcher and go on
        home.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in front of everybody he got up, without delay picked up his stretcher,
        and left, to everyone’s amazement and to their glorification of God saying, “We’ve never seen
        anything like this before.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Again, he ventured out near the sea. Everyone in the crowd started coming to
        him, and he began teaching them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As he was passing through, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the customs
        table, and tells him directly, “Be my follower.” And he got up and became his follower.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As he sat down to dine at home, many tax collectors and other sinners gathered
        there to eat with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The designated teachers, the ones affiliated with the Pharisees, observing that
        he takes meals with sinners and tax collectors, were saying to his disciples, “How is it that
        he dines with the tax collectors and other sinners?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus heard this and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Healthy people
        don’t need a doctor, but those who have something wrong with them do. I didn’t come to call <STYLE
        fs="italic">on</STYLE> those right with God but rather <STYLE fs="italic">on</STYLE> sinners.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they approached him with
        a question, “What’s the reason that John’s disciples fast and the Pharisees’ disciples fast,
        but your disciples don’t fast?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“The groom’s cronies can’t fast when
        the groom’s around, <STYLE fs="italic">can they</STYLE>? As long as the groom is with them, they’re
        not able to fast.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">But there’ll come a day when the groom is taken away,
        and that’s the day they’ll start fasting.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">No one uses a patch made from new material to patch
        an old garment with; otherwise, the new <STYLE fs="italic">material</STYLE> will wind up tearing

      <VERS vnumber="22"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">And no one puts freshly-squeezed grape juice into

        the wine and the skins will be ruined. Rather, grape juice <STYLE fs="italic">goes</STYLE> into
        new wine skins.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He happened to be passing through the grain fields on days which were Sabbath
        days, and his disciples began to make their way through the fields stripping the grain off the
        heads of the stalks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Pharisees proceeded to say to him, “Take a look—they’re doing what’s forbidden
        on the Sabbath.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Looking deeper at the situation, he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Didn’t
        you read about what David did when the need arose and he got hungry—and so did those who were
        with him?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">How, when Abiathar was high priest, he entered the
        house of God and ate the holy bread, which no one’s allowed to eat except the priests, and—not
        only that—he passed it out to those who were with him?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He summarized, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“The Sabbath came into being for <STYLE
        fs="italic">the benefit of</STYLE> mankind, and not mankind for <STYLE fs="italic">the benefit
        of</STYLE> the Sabbath,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">the result being that the Man is also master over

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yet again he introduced himself to those in the synagogue and attended a meeting.
        There was a man there with a shriveled-up hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they were watching him closely, to see if he was going to heal him on the
        Sabbath, so that they’d have something to accuse him of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He addressed the man with the shriveled-up hand, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Get
        up and stand <STYLE fs="italic">front and</STYLE> center.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He challenged them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Is it permissible on the Sabbath
        to do a good deed or to do bad, to save someone’s life or to kill someone?” </STYLE>They remained
        silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He looked all around, staring at them in fury, being deeply grieved over the
        callousness of their hearts, and said to the man intently, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Stretch
        your hand out.” </STYLE>He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After the Pharisees departed, they wasted no time in meeting with the Herodians
        about him, to figure out how they could kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus, accompanied by his disciples, ventured over to the sea, and a great many
        followed him from Galilee, and from Judea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River,
        and from the areas around Tyre and Sidon—a great many, hearing about how much he was doing, went
        to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And because of the crowd, he spoke to his disciples about getting a boat, so
        that they wouldn’t press in on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Indeed, he treated many, resulting in them mobbing him in order that they might
        receive a touch from him, whoever was getting the tar beaten out of him by disease or whatnot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, time and time again, the demonic spirits, when they saw him, prostrated
        themselves before him in homage and screamed out, “You are the Son of God!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, time and time again, he was sternly silencing them so they would not cause
        him to be plainly known as such.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He hiked up a mountain and summoned those whom he had been wanting to have as
        his disciples, and they came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He made twelve, and he made them so that they would be with him and so that
        he could send them out to preach his message</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and to have authority to cast out demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He assigned the name “Peter” to Simon,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Now he came to a house. Once again, the crowd converged on it, resulting in

      <VERS vnumber="21">When the neighbors caught wind of this, they came out to get him under control,
        since they had been saying all along that he’s lost his mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the designated teachers, the Scribes, made the journey from Jerusalem and
        had been saying that he’s possessed by the Chief Demon himself, and that, by means of the chief,
        he casts out the underling-demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He called them over and began to teach them by using analogies: <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“How

      <VERS vnumber="1">On another occasion, he began to teach near the sea. A huge crowd gathered around

        on dry land and squeezed in as close as they could to the shoreline.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He began to teach them by means of analogy, telling many. In one of his sermons

      <VERS vnumber="17">The fact is, Herod himself had dispatched his men and had John taken into custody
        and locked him up in jail on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, because he had married

        all the while saying, “What further testimony do we need?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">You all heard the blasphemy; what’s it looking like to you?” So everyone there
        sentenced him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Some of them began to go about spitting on him, blindfolding him, and striking
        him, saying to him, “Prophesy.” And then the attendants took him and slapped him around.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">Being outside in the courtyard, Peter was approached by one of the high priest’s
        servant girls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">She saw Peter warming himself up, took a good hard look at him, and then says
        to him, “You too were with Jesus of Nazareth.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">He denied it, saying, “I have no first-hand knowledge or understanding of what
        you’re saying,” and he left the courtyard to go out to the porch. A rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">While looking at him, the servant girl began talking to the bystanders again,
        “This guy’s one of them.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">He denied it again. Again, a bit later, the bystanders were saying to Peter,
        “Seriously—you’re one of them, since you’re a Galilean.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">He began to cuss repeatedly and to swear by oaths, “I don’t know this person,
        whomever it is that you’re talking about.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered the statement which
        Jesus made, that before a rooster crows twice, you will have denied me three times. It hit him
        like a ton of bricks, and he started crying.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Without delay, late in the night the chief priests, along with all the councilmen
        and the designated teachers, convened a meeting, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered
        him into Pilate’s custody.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Pilate asked him, “You’re the king of the Jews?” He answered him, “Whatever you
        say.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again, Pilate asked him, “You’re not going to say anything in response? Take
        a look at how many accusations they’ve leveled against you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But to Pilate’s astonishment, Jesus didn’t have anything more to say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He had an ongoing tradition, done at each festival, of releasing one prisoner
        for them, whomever they’d ask for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was one called Barabbas who had been imprisoned along with the revolutionaries,
        in particular those who had committed murder during the insurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The crowd came over and initiated making the request, in accordance with his
        usual practice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Pilate responded to them, “Do you want me to set the king of the Jews free?”,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">since he was aware that the chief priests had him arrested out of envy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, the chief priests had whipped the crowd into a frenzy, in order that their
        preference would be to release Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12"><BR art="x-nl"/>Again, Pilate responded to them, “So now, what do you want me
        to do with the one who’s called the King of the Jews?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Again, they shouted, “Crucify him!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14"><BR art="x-nl"/>Pilate said to them multiple times, “…Because he’s done what
        wrong?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Intending to placate the crowd, Pilate set Barabbas free and handed over Jesus,
        after he had him flogged, to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The soldiers led him away to a courtyard inside the compound, the one used by
        the governor’s security guards, and called over the entire company of guards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They clothed him in a robe a nobleman would wear and placed on him a crown,
        a wreath woven from thorns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They began to go about greeting him, “Pleased to meet you King of the Jews.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They kept on hitting him on the head with a rod, spitting on him, and getting
        on their knees in an act of subservience to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they finished ridiculing him, they took the robe off and put his clothes
        back on him, and they led him away to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They pressed into service a random passerby, Simon of Cyrene (the one who’s
        the father of Alexander and Rufus), who happened to be coming in from working out in the fields,
        to carry his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They brought him up on top of the place called Golgotha, which translated means
        “Skull Place.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They kept on trying to give him spiced wine, but he wouldn’t take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They crucified him and divvied up his clothing, rolling dice to see who was
        going to get to take it away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now it was mid-morning when they performed the crucifixion on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">There was a sign stating the reason why he was crucified, and it read, “The
        king of the Jews.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They crucified two thugs with him, together as a group, one to the left of him
        and one to the right of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Those who passed by reviled him, nodding their heads left and right saying,
        “Ah! The one who’ll supposedly destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Save yourself: come down off that cross.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the same way, the chief priests and the designated teachers, going back and
        forth with each other making fun of him, in the midst of that were saying, “He went and rescued
        others, but he cannot save himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Messiah, the Christ, the King of Israel: let him come down from the cross
        now, so that we would see and believe.” Even his fellow crucifixion-mates kept on taunting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">When it got to be noon, darkness appeared over the entire planet until late
        afternoon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and in the late afternoon, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Eloi,

      <VERS vnumber="35">Some of the bystanders heard this and started saying, “Look, he’s calling on

      <VERS vnumber="36">Someone ran and soaked a sponge in a mixture of water and vinegar that the soldiers
        commonly drank, put it on a rod, and proceeded to offer it to him to drink, saying, “Let’s see
        if Elijah comes and takes him down from off the cross,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">but Jesus let out a great cry and passed away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">and the temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Seeing this, the army captain standing across from him said, “This man really
        was the embodiment of a son of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now there were also women watching at a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene,
        Mary mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,</VERS>

        needs when he was in Galilee, and many other women who accompanied him to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">It had gotten to be late, and since it was a preparatory day (that is, a pre-feast
        day or pre-Sabbath preparatory day),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Joseph of Arimathea, an influential councilman, who also was himself a true
        believer, got up the courage, entered Pilate’s compound, and went up to Pilate and asked for
        Jesus’s body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But Pilate wondered if he had in fact died already, and summoned the captain
        and asked him if it had been a while since he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Getting up to speed with the captain, he presented the body to Joseph as a gift,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">and Joseph purchased a cloth sheet made of linen and used for wrapping, took
        him down, rolled him up in the sheet, put him in a tomb, one which had been hewn out of a rock
        formation, and rolled a stone over the tomb’s entrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were monitoring where he was
        being placed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Mark chapter 15 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After sundown, just after the Sabbath restrictions came to a close, Mary Magdalene,
        Mary mother of James, and Salome bought fragrant spices in order to go and apply to his body,
        covering it all over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Very early on Sunday morning, when the sun had just risen, they went to the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They were repeatedly saying amongst themselves, “Who’s going to roll the stone
        back away from the entrance of the tomb?”,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they all at once looked up and observed that the stone had been rolled away
        (it was simply enormous, you see).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They came to the tomb and saw a man who looked to be in his late teens or early
        twenties sitting off to the right wearing a long white robe, and they were startled out of their
        wits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he then tells them, “Don’t be startled. Jesus of Nazareth who had been crucified
        has been resurrected; he’s not here—take a look at the place where they put him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In any event, go your way and tell his disciples—and Peter—that he’s heading
        out before them to Galilee. They’ll see him there, just like he told them they would.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They exited the tomb and began to run away like mad, since they were in a state
        of shock and were shaking all over. They didn’t say anything to anyone, since they were still
        too terrified to do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After he had been resurrected early Sunday morning, he appeared first to Mary
        Magdalene, whom he had cast out seven demons out of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">That lady went and told the news to those who had been mourning and weeping
        with her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and those who heard that he’s alive and that he had been seen by her refused
        to believe it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now after these appearances, he appeared in a different form to two of them
        while they were going out to the countryside,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and those very people went away and told everyone else—they didn’t believe those
        people either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now last of all he appeared to the Eleven while they were relaxing taking a
        meal, and he chewed them out for their refusal to believe and for their hardness of heart, because
        they didn’t believe those who had beheld him resurrected.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Go into all the inhabited<STYLE

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="41" bname="Luke" bsname="Luke">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In light of the fact that many have attempted to compose a narrative concerning
        the deeds which have been carried out to fulfillment among us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and to record it in the same way that they—those from the get-go who became eye-witnesses
        and custodians of the entire affair—delivered and entrusted it to us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">it seemed like a good idea for me to follow up after them and write something
        for you, something that starts from the very beginning and which is completely accurate and in
        sequential order, Lord Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that you would become thoroughly acquainted with the affairs which you’ve
        learned by word of mouth, and that you would know them with certainty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of the Jews, that there was a certain
        priest named Zechariah, from the Order of Abijah, and he had a wife who was of the priestly caste—and
        her name was Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, their conduct, from God’s perspective,
        was that they complied with all the commandments and expectations of correct behavior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They had no children, because Elizabeth couldn’t have any children, and both
        were now elderly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now during his priestly order’s timeslot in the rotation schedule, he happened
        to be the one performing the priestly duties in the holy presence of God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(the appointment being determined according to the priests’ tradition of rolling
        dice), having entered into the temple sanctuary itself to light the incense;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and everyone who was in the multitude, a multitude of the folk-people, was outside
        praying during the hour of the incense lighting ritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So now, an angel sent from the Lord appeared to him standing to the right of
        the Altar of Incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Looking at the angel, Zechariah became disturbed, and fear fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah; you see, your prayer has
        been taken to heart, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you’ll name him John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He’ll be a cause of joy and exultation for you, and many will rejoice at his
        birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Indeed, he’ll be used mightily by the Lord and won’t drink wine or liquor—absolutely
        won’t—and he’ll be filled with the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s womb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and many native Israelites will heed the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Lord will use him as a herald in a spirit and power the likeness of which
        Elijah had, to soften the hearts of the fathers towards the children, and the skeptics and the
        disobedient to the sensibility of the ways of the righteous, to bring about a fully-refined people
        for the Lord.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Zechariah said to the angel, “Just how will the realization of these things
        come to me? The fact is, I’m old, and my wife is well-past her prime.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The angel replied, “I am the high-ranking angel Gabriel: the one who stands
        in the presence of God. Concerning these things, He sent me to speak to you and deliver the good
        news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">See here now—you will remain silent, unable to speak, until the time comes that
        these things come to pass, as a consequence of you not having believed my words, which will be
        fulfilled in the course of good time.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The people were expecting Zechariah to have come out already and were baffled
        at how long a time he was spending in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he’d
        seen a vision while inside the temple. He was gesturing to them, all the while remaining mute.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When his order’s timeslot for priestly service was up, he left to go back home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some time afterwards, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and during the five months
        that she was keeping herself in seclusion, she kept on saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">”All this because the Lord wanted things to turn out for me in a way that would
        remove my shame in the eyes of others.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel
        to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">to a young, never-married woman engaged to a man named Joseph, who was a direct
        descendant of David—and the name of this young woman was Mary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28"><BR art="x-nl"/>He entered the physical world right in front of her and said,
        “Greetings, favored-one, the Lord be with you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now she was deeply disturbed at the remark and was trying to figure out what
        the nature of the visit would be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary; the fact is, you’ve found favor
        with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">See here now—you’ll conceive and give birth to a son, and you’ll name him ‘Jesus.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He’ll be capable, noteworthy, and accomplished and will be called a son of the
        Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">and he’ll reign forever over the Israeli people, and his kingdom will never
        come to an end.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Mary said to the angel, “How will this come about, since I don’t have a husband
        with whom to be intimate?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the miraculous
        power of the Most High will engulf you. For this reason, the one you’re giving birth to is holy,
        and he’ll be called a son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Take a look—in her old age, your relative Elizabeth—even she—is pregnant with
        a son; the one everyone took for granted was infertile—this is her sixth month of pregnancy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You see, with God, all things are possible.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Mary said, “I present myself as the servant of the Lord. Let things come to
        pass with regard to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">During this time, Mary took a trip into the hill country, to a town in Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">She entered Zechariah’s house and was welcomed enthusiastically by Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">It so happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in
        her womb; Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and with a great cry uttered back, “You in particular among women be blessed,
        (that is, the recipient of good things); and blessed be, (that is, let the pronouncement of goodness
        be over), the produce of your womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">How did I get such an honor, that the mother of my Lord would come to visit
        me?</VERS>

        which have been spoken to her and established from the Lord.”</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="57">Now Elizabeth’s due-date arrived, and she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord showered tremendous mercy on

      <VERS vnumber="59">When the eighth day after birth came, they went to circumcise the child, and

      <VERS vnumber="1">Around that time, an edict from Caesar Augustus was issued to the entire civilized

      <VERS vnumber="2">This edict was a census, and this census was the first one issued during the

      <VERS vnumber="3">Everyone was either coming or going to be registered, each to the city he belonged
        to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So Joseph went from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of
        David, which is called “Bethlehem,” on account of him being of the lineage of and being a descendant

      <VERS vnumber="6">While they were there, her due-date arrived,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and she gave birth to a son, her firstborn, wrapped him in a blanket, and laid
        him in a manger, since there wasn’t any room for them in the upstairs floor of the house they
        were at.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nearby in the same area, there were shepherds working the night shift outdoors,
        keeping an eye on their sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">An angel sent from the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shined
        all around them, and they became very frightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, since I’m here, you see, to announce
        to you something good, a message about the tremendous grace which will be given to all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">since this day a savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born in your midst in the

      <VERS vnumber="19">Mary latched on to all these words while they were being deposited into her
        heart and collected there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for everything they heard
        about and saw, which was in fact just like it had been spoken to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When the eighth day, the day for him to be circumcised, rolled around, they
        named him “Jesus,” the name given by the angel before he was conceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when the purification time, the span of time in accordance with the Old
        Testament statute, had expired, they took him over to Jerusalem to be presented to the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">just as it’s written in the Old Testament, “Every man-child who is a mother’s
        first delivery shall be designated as set aside for the Lord,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and to offer up a sacrifice according to the commandment in the Old Testament,
        “a pair of turtledoves or two young doves.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now, you see, there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this fellow was
        righteous and devout, awaiting Israel’s consolation, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He had been informed in a consultation by the Holy Spirit that he won’t encounter
        death before seeing Christ the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By the Spirit, he went to the temple and to the parents as they were presenting
        the child Jesus, carrying out the Old Testament ritual concerning him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and he himself took him into his arms, gave a blessing to God, and said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">Simeon pronounced a blessing on them and said to Mary, “You see, this fellow

      <VERS vnumber="35">And for you—your very life-being will be gone through with a sword, pierced

      <VERS vnumber="36">There was a prophetess named Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.
        She was up there in years, having married as a young woman, her marriage lasting for seven years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and after that being a widow for 84 years, during which time she hadn’t been
        absent from the temple, fasting and praying day and night in service to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">At the same time the ritual was going on, she went over and stood by their side,
        all the while professing affirmations in acknowledgement to God and speaking about Him to all
        those in Jerusalem awaiting the rectification of their dire straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When all the rituals prescribed by the Old Testament were concluded, they left
        for Galilee, to their hometown of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now the child kept on growing and kept on getting stronger, while being filled
        with wisdom, and God’s favor was upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Year after year, his parents kept going back to Jerusalem, to the Passover festival,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and when he was twelve years old, they went to Jerusalem according to festival
        custom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">When the festival, which lasted a few days, was over, as they were departing,
        the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem, but his parents were unaware.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Having assumed that he was somewhere in the caravan, they were on the road a
        few days and began searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">but they weren’t able to find him. They returned to Jerusalem in search of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">It so happened that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in
        the middle of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">All of those who were listening to him were amazed at his understanding—his
        ability to put things together—and at his answers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Upon seeing this, his parents were taken aback, and his mother said to him,
        “Child, why have you treated us this way? Look—your father and I have been pulling our hair out
        looking for you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">He said to them, “Just why now were you searching for me? Didn’t you know that
        I had to be in the midst of my Father’s interests?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">They didn’t put all the pieces together from the remark that was spoken to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He left with them and went to Nazareth, and he was staying in submission to
        their authority. His mother in her heart latched on to all these incidences, one after another;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">He went into all the surrounding regions of the Jordan preaching a baptism—a

      <VERS vnumber="8">In line with this, produce the corresponding actions on par with a change for

        and establish descendants for Abraham from out of these stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The axe is already lying next to the tree trunk ready to be used to cut the tree

      <VERS vnumber="11">He replied to them by saying, “Whoever has two shirts, give one to him who doesn’t
        have any, and the one who has food do the same.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said, “Teacher, how are we supposed

      <VERS vnumber="13">He said, “Don’t take anything more than what the quotas and tax rates mandate.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14"><BR art="x-nl"/>Soldiers also were questioning him, “How are we too supposed

      <VERS vnumber="15">While the people were in a state of anticipation, everybody was thinking the
        circumstances concerning John over in their heart, going back and forth, trying to decide whether
        he was the Messiah—the Christ—or not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">John declared to them all, “Me—I baptize in water. But one’s coming who’s greater

    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on one particular day there happened to be a crowd situated in close proximity

      <VERS vnumber="2">He saw two boats docked on the lake’s shore. Now the fishermen who manned these
        boats had disembarked and were scrubbing their fishing nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But one of them—and this was Simon—was still onboard one of the boats. He asked
        him to cast the boat out a bit from the shore, and he, having taken a seat in the boat, began
        to teach the crowd from the boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4"><BR art="x-nl"/>Now as he wrapped up his talk, he said to Simon, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Take

      <VERS vnumber="5">Simon answered back, “We’ve been at it all night working and haven’t gotten a

      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they’d done this, they entrapped a huge swarm of fish, to the point
        where it was beginning to break their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They motioned to their partners in the other boat to come help haul the fish
        in, and they came and filled both boats to their sinking thresholds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Simon Peter, having witnessed this, fell to his knees before Jesus saying, “Leave
        me, sir, since I’m a sinful man.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You see, those surrounding him and all those who were a part of his company were
        amazed at the take of fish being hauled in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the same way, so were the sons of Zebedee, James and John, Simon’s coworkers.
        Jesus said to Simon, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Don’t be afraid: from now on, you’ll be catching
        men, taking them alive.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after the boats returned to shore, they all left and became his followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While he happened to still be in one of the boats, a man with a full-blown case
        of leprosy appeared out of nowhere. Seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, “Sir, should

      <VERS vnumber="13">He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I

      <VERS vnumber="14">He, though, told him sternly and in no uncertain terms to not tell anyone, but
        instead to go and show himself to the priest and to bring him that which the Old Testament commanded,
        in order that the evidence be submitted for an official confirmation of the purging of the disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But to an even greater extent, information concerning him spread through and
        throughout, and huge crowds kept gathering together to listen and to be treated and healed of
        everything that was dragging them down, physically.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As far as his own self was concerned, he kept stealing away to various places
        out in the countryside, alone, praying continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He happened to be teaching one day, and in attendance, paying attention, were
        Pharisees and instructors in the Law of Moses, who had come from all of the towns of Galilee,
        Judea, and Jerusalem. There was a supernatural power of the Lord present for him to perform healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Just like that, a group of men showed up carrying a person who was paralyzed
        on a cot, and they were trying to bring him in and place him in front him, for him to attend
        to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Since they weren’t able to find any way to bring him in on account of the crowd,
        they climbed up and got on the rooftop patio, and they lowered him down through the roof itself
        and put him together with his cot right smack in front of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Seeing their faith, he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Fellow, your sins are

      <VERS vnumber="22">Now Jesus, aware of what they’d been mulling over, responded to them by saying,
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“What are you mulling over in your hearts?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">What’s easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or

      <VERS vnumber="25">Immediately and in front of everyone, he got up from that which he’d been seemingly
        forever lying upon and left for home, glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Everyone became ecstatic and began to glorify God, and they were filled with
        deep reverence, saying, “We witnessed an incredible miracle.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After this he departed. He saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax
        booth, and he said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Be one of my followers.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He left everything behind, got up, and became one of his followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Levi threw a huge party for him at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors
        was there and others were there with them seated around the table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The Pharisees and their designated teachers started to grumble to his disciples,
        “Why do you live it up with the tax collectors and sinners?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Jesus replied to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Those who are healthy don’t

      <VERS vnumber="32"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I haven’t come to summon those who do right to turn

      <VERS vnumber="16">He took the five loaves and two fishes, looked up into the sky, gave thanks

      <VERS vnumber="17">Everyone ate until they were full, as much as he or she wanted, and twelve baskets

      <VERS vnumber="19">They answered, “John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Yet others say that you’re

      <VERS vnumber="20">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>“Who do you all

      <VERS vnumber="21">He got them to promise not to spread this fact around to anyone:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">About eight days after he spoke these words, he took Peter, John, and James
        with him and ascended a mountain for a session of prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">While he was praying, his facial appearance happened to change, and his clothes
        also changed to a lightning-like white.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Just like that, two men began to converse with him, none other than Moses and
        Elijah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">who were visible in their glorious magnificence, beginning to speak to him about
        his departure from the Earth, which was going to be fulfilled in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Peter and those with him were dead asleep, but snapped out of it and became
        wide awake and saw him in his magnificent splendor and the two men standing together with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">While they were parting with him, Peter said to Jesus, “Boss, good thing we’re
        here. Let’s make three little holy edifices, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not
        having any idea what he was saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he was still saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. Fear
        came upon them as they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">A voice appeared out of the cloud saying, “This is my Son, the Chosen-From-Among-Many
        One, evermore listen to him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">With the voice’s appearance, they noticed that Jesus was now alone. For days
        to come they kept their mouths shut and wouldn’t tell anyone what they had witnessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">A large crowd met him the sixth day after they descended the mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Out of nowhere, a man yelled out from the crowd, “Teacher, I’m begging you to
        take a look at my son, since he’s the only son I have…”—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Just like that, a demon spirit takes hold of him, screams all of a sudden, and
        throws him into a convulsion, foaming at the mouth, hardly leaving him even for a moment, battering
        him all the while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">—“…Your disciples were asked to cast it out, and they weren’t able to.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus’s response this was, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Oh, this disbelieving,
        corrupt Zeitgeist! Just how long do I <STYLE fs="italic">have to</STYLE> hold your hand and put
        up with you? Bring your son over here to me.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">They then brought him over to him; the demon threw him to the ground, and convulsed
        him. Jesus dropped the hammer on the filthy, disgusting spirit , the child was cured, and they
        gave him back to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43"><BR art="x-nl"/>Everyone was amazed at the magnificence of God. While everyone
        was still marveling at everything he was doing, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“As far as you all are concerned, however, get this
        into your head: the way things are headed, the Man is going to be betrayed and is going to be
        taken into custody by sinners.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But this remark wasn’t getting through to them. It had been hidden from them,
        kept locked up as a secret from them, so they weren’t seeing it for what it was, and from time
        to time when they thought about this remark were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Now an argument arose between them, namely which one of them is the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus, understanding what was at the heart of the issue, got ahold of a child,
        had him stand next to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Whoever willingly receives this
        child—that is, wholeheartedly welcomes him and considers him to be one of his own—as part of

        The fact is, the one among you at the lowest station in life—this person is great.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Upon reflection, John said, “Boss, we saw some people casting out demons as
        though they were authorized and commissioned to do so by you, and time and time again we prevented
        them or otherwise hindered them from doing so, because their initiative didn’t originate from
        us.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">He said to John, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Don’t hinder them. The fact is,
        he who isn’t opposed to us is on our side.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">As those days were coming to a close, the days before his ascension, in his
        inner self he mustered an unwavering determination for going to Jerusalem and enduring the hardships
        there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He sent out some agents to the places he was intent on going and was expecting
        confrontation. In their comings and goings, they went into the towns of Samaria as part of their

      <VERS vnumber="53">but they didn’t whole-heartedly welcome him and embrace his ministry there,

      <VERS vnumber="54">When his disciples witnessed this, James and John said, “Lord, do you want us
        to call fire down from the sky and incinerate them?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">He turned and scolded them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">and they went to another town instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">While they were on the road, someone said to him, “I’ll follow you wherever

      <VERS vnumber="58">Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“The foxes have dens and birds

        place to get away from it all.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">He said to someone else, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Be my follower,” </STYLE>but
        he said, “Lord, let me first go out and bury my father.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">He said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Let the dead bury their own dead; you,

      <VERS vnumber="61">He said to someone else, “I’ll be your follower, Lord, but first let me say

      <VERS vnumber="38">He said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Why have you become troubled, and what’s

      <VERS vnumber="42"><STYLE fs="italic">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">A man sent from God appeared on the scene, and his name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This fellow came to give an official account, so that he would give an account

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Concept became flesh and set up camp among us. We beheld his glory,

      <VERS vnumber="15">John testified about him, having cried out, “This fellow here is the one I referred

        (and is) superior to me.’”</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Now the ones who had been sent were sent by the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They posed a question asking, “So now, why do you perform baptisms if you’re
        neither the Messiah, Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John replied by saying, “My role is to baptize in water. But someone has taken

      <VERS vnumber="28">These things took place in Bethany alongside the Jordan River, the place where
        John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, “Look here—God’s lamb

      <VERS vnumber="31">I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, he was not known
        even to me in order he would become known to Israel all at once. This is the reason my role was
        to come baptizing in water.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John solemnly declared in a statement for the record that he had beheld
        the Spirit coming down out of the sky like a dove and remaining upon him from then on:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">”I had no personal first-hand knowledge of him; on the contrary, the One who
        sent me to baptize in water, He’s the One who said to me, ‘Upon whom you happen to behold the

      <VERS vnumber="34">And I have beheld this event personally and have solemnly attested that this
        person is the Son of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again, the next day John was just standing there, he and two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and saw Jesus going here and there, and interjected, “Look here—God’s lamb.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">His two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus, in order to become

      <VERS vnumber="38">Jesus turned and saw them following him and, prompting them, said, “What can

      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus, on top of the situation, told them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Fill the

      <VERS vnumber="8">Continuing his train of thought, he told them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Now
        draw some water <STYLE fs="italic">from one of the pots</STYLE> and bring it to the maître ‘d.”</STYLE>
        So they brought some over to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">This miracle that Jesus performed in Cana, Galilee was the first in a long series

      <VERS vnumber="2">Among the citizens of Jerusalem, there was a pool at the Sheep Gate (which in
        Aramaic is called Bethesda), which has five porticos.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these porticos lay a multitude of those who are feeble with sicknesses of
        one sort or another, of the blind, the lame, and those with shriveled-up limbs, perpetually lying
        there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now there was a man with a sickness who had been there for thirty-eight years,
        and his sickness made him feeble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing this fellow lying there, Jesus, knowing that he had been there for a long
        time, engaged him in conversation and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Do you want to get better?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no person to toss me into the pool when the
        water’s been agitated. While it’s agitated and I’m on my way to the pool, someone else cuts in
        front of me.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus got to the point and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Get up, pick the
        cot up, take it, and walk around,”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl"/>and the man got better immediately, picked his cot up, and walked
        around. But that was on a Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><BR art="x-nl"/>So now, the Judean Jews proceeded to say to the man who had
        been healed, “It’s the Sabbath, and you’re not allowed to pick up your cot and take it somewhere.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He replied, “The guy who made me well told me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">‘Pick
        it up and walk around’</STYLE>.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They asked, “Who’s the person who told you, ‘Pick it up and walk around’?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the man who was healed didn’t know who it was; you see, Jesus had ducked
        out of sight and into the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After all of this, Jesus found him in the temple and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I
        see you’re all better now. Don’t go about sinning, lest something worse happen to you.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man left from there and reported to the Judeans that Jesus was the one who
        made him better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Because of this, the Judeans began to go after Jesus, because he did this on
        the Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus’s reply to them was, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Up to the present moment,
        my Father’s been doing <STYLE fs="italic">good</STYLE> deeds, and is doing good deeds, and so
        am I.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So because of this, the Judeans were all the more trying to kill him, because
        he wasn’t just going about freeing people from their sicknesses on the Sabbath, but he also kept
        saying that God is his own Father, making himself out to be equal to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Jesus proceeded to defend himself, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m telling
        you the honest-to-goodness truth, I really am: the Son can’t do anything that’s from out of himself
        except for what he happens to see the Father doing. For what That One were to do, the Son does
        these same things and in the same manner.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You see, the Father extends his close friendship
        to the Son and shows him everything which He in His own right does, and He’ll show him greater
        things than these—<STYLE fs="italic">good </STYLE>deeds, that is—in order to dazzle you all.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You see, just as the Father resurrects the dead and
        breathes life back into them, in the same way the Son breathes life back into whom he desires.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">So—no—the Father doesn’t judge anyone, <STYLE fs="italic">reaching
        a guilty verdict</STYLE>, but instead has given the entirety of the judgment <STYLE fs="italic">of

      <VERS vnumber="23"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">in order that everyone would respect and honor the

      <VERS vnumber="24"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth, I

      <VERS vnumber="26"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">For just as the Father has life in himself, in the

    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of John chapter 5 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these events, Jesus departed for the other side of the Sea of Galilee (otherwise
        known as Tiberias).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A large crowd followed him, because they were seeing miracle after miracle that
        he did for those feeble with a sickness of one sort or another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Jesus hiked up a large hill and proceeded to sit down there with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the Passover wasn’t too far off, the Jewish religious holiday festival.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Jesus, after lifting up his eyes and seeing that a large crowd was approaching,
        engaged Philip, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Where can we go buy food from in order to feed them?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now he was saying this to test him; the fact is, he knew what he was about to
        do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Philip replied, “$20,000 worth of bread wouldn’t suffice for each person to get
        even just a bit.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">One of the disciples, Andrew Simon Peter’s brother, jumped in and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">“There’s a lad here who has five loaves of barley-bread and two grilled fishes.
        Apart from these, what’s available for such a crowd as this?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus, adding to this, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>“Get
        the people to find a spot, have a seat, and relax.”</STYLE>Now there was a lot of grass in the
        area, so around five-thousand grown men—not to mention the women and children—found a place to
        sit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thereupon, Jesus took the break, offered thanks, and distributed it to those
        seated, and the same with the fish, as much as they kept wanting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As they were filled, he further said to his disciples, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Gather
        the leftover scraps, lest we waste anything.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they gathered and filled twelve baskets of scraps from what was leftover
        by those who had eaten, leftovers from out of the five loaves of the barley-bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The people, upon seeing the miracle that he did, began saying, “This fellow
        really is the Prophet who comes to the world.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and seize him and carry him off
        to make him king, withdrew alone into the large hill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As it had gotten late, his disciples went down to the lake,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">boarded a boat, and began making their way to the other side of the lake, to
        Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus hadn’t joined them yet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">furthermore, strong gusts of wind began to stir over the lake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having reached the point where they had rowed around 3 or 3.5 miles (4.5 or
        5.5 km), they saw Jesus walking about on top of the lake, and he was getting near the boat. They
        became frightened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He engages with them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“It’s me, don’t be afraid.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then they kept on wanting to take him into the boat, but in no time the boat
        landed on the shore that they were destined for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The next day, the crowd which stood on the other side of the lake observed that
        at the time they departed there weren’t any other boats there except for the one, and since Jesus
        hadn’t joined his disciples in the boat, the disciples had departed alone instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">That aside, other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where the
        Lord gave thanks and they ate the bread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">so when the crowd saw that Jesus wasn’t there nor were his disciples, they boarded
        these boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, “Teacher,
        when did you get here?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness
        truth, I really am: you weren’t looking for me because you witnessed a miracle but because you
        participated in eating the bread and ate until you were full.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Don’t work for food that has an expiration date but

      <VERS vnumber="28">So they said, “How shall we go about doing the things of God?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“This is how you do the things of

      <VERS vnumber="30">So they said, “So now, what miraculous sign do you perform, in order that we
        would see it and believe in you? What can you do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Our ancestors ate bread called manna while in the wilderness, just as it’s recorded
        in Scripture, ‘He gave them bread from the sky—from heaven—to eat’.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness

      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I am the Bread of Life. He who comes

      <VERS vnumber="36"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">That aside, though, I said that you’ve taken the

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After all of this, Jesus was travelling about Galilee; indeed, he hadn’t been
        wanting to travel throughout Judea, since the Judeans wouldn’t let up in trying to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was coming up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so his brothers said to him, “Relocate from here and make your way to Judea,
        so that your disciples too might behold the miraculous works that you do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When you get right down to it, no one does something in seclusion when he’s striving
        to be a well-known, public figure. If you do these miraculous works, reveal yourself to the world.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The fact is, his brothers hadn’t been believing in him all the while either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Jesus, consuming the remark, told them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My Time
        has not <STYLE fs="italic">yet</STYLE> arrived, but Your Time is always ready.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">The world—the established order of humans—isn’t able

      <VERS vnumber="8"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You all go on over to the festival; Me, though—I’m
        not going to this festival, because my time has not yet been fulfilled.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having said these things, he stayed in Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As his brothers went down to the festival, then he too went, not openly but
        secretly instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So then, the Judeans kept searching for him at the festival and kept on repeating,
        “Where is that guy?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There was a huge amount of murmuring and grumbling about him by the crowds;
        some kept saying that he’s good, but others kept saying, “No—on the contrary—he leads the crowd
        astray.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one, however, was talking about him in public due to the fear of the Judeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now already midway through the festival, Jesus went over to the temple and proceeded
        to teach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Judeans were amazed, “How does this fellow know the Scriptures so well,
        being uneducated?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My teaching is not mine but rather
        the One who sent me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">If someone desires to do His will, he himself will

      <VERS vnumber="18"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">He who speaks on his own seeks his own glory; the

      <VERS vnumber="19"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Hasn’t Moses given us the <STYLE fs="italic">Old

      <VERS vnumber="20">The crowd answered, “You’re demon-possessed. Who’s trying to kill you?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I did one <STYLE fs="italic">miraculous

      <VERS vnumber="22"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">All throughout, <STYLE fs="italic">the Law of </STYLE>Moses

      <VERS vnumber="23"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">If a man gets circumcised on the Sabbath in order

      <VERS vnumber="24"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Refrain from deciding or judging according to how

      <VERS vnumber="25">Some of those from Jerusalem then proceeded to say, “Isn’t this the guy they’re
        trying to kill?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Take a look—he’s speaking aloud in public, and they’re not saying a thing to
        him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That aside—we know what this guy’s all about; but when the Messiah, the Christ,
        does in fact come, no one’s been able to figure out what his raison d’être will be.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So while Jesus was teaching in the temple, he cried out, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“You
        both know me and you know where I’m from. I haven’t come from myself. Aside from that, the One
        who sent me is true, Whom you don’t know.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I know Him, since I am from Him and that’s <STYLE

      <VERS vnumber="30">So they tried to apprehend him, but no one managed to lay a hand on him, because
        his time hadn’t come yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But among those in the crowd, many believed in him. They kept saying, “When
        the Messiah does come, will he perform more miracles than what this fellow’s done?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The Pharisees heard that the crowd was chatting about these matters, matters
        which are related to him, so the High Priests and the Pharisees sent temple police to apprehend
        him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Jesus then said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’ll be with you for yet a little
        while longer and head on back to the One who sent me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You’ll look for me and won’t <STYLE fs="italic">be
        able to </STYLE>find me, and where I’ll be, you can’t go.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So the Judeans said to themselves, “Where’s this guy planning to go that we
        won’t be able to find him? He’s not intending to go to the Jews scattered throughout the Roman
        Empire and teach the Greek-speaking Jews, is he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">What about this statement, ‘You’ll look for me and won’t be able to find me,’
        and, ‘Where I’ll be, you can’t go’?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">On the last day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“If
        someone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">He who believes in me, just like the verse in the
        Old Testament says, ‘Streams of water from deep inside of him will flow out of him’.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Now he was talking about the Spirit, he whom they were going to receive, that
        is, those who believed in him. You see, the Spirit had not yet come, since Jesus had not yet
        been glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then out of the crowd these words arose and were spoken, “This person really
        is the Prophet promised in the Old Testament.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Others were saying, “This person is the Messiah.” But others were saying, “Certainly
        the Messiah won’t come from Galilee, will he?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Isn’t there a verse in the Old Testament which says that the Messiah will be
        a descendant of David and will be from Bethlehem, the town where David was from?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">So the crowd split into factions over him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and some of them kept wanting to apprehend him; instead, no one laid a hand
        on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The police returned to the High Priests and the Pharisees, who told those guys,
        “Why didn’t you haul him off?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The police replied, “Never before has a man spoken the way this man has.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The Pharisees replied, “You haven’t been led astray too, have you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Not a single one of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Instead, the only ones who’ve believed in him is this bunch, the ones who don’t
        understand the Law of Moses—the accursed.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Nicodemus, the one who visited him earlier on and who’s one of them, interjected
        and said to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">”Our code of law, the Law of Moses, doesn’t allow a verdict to be rendered unless
        the defendant is first heard from and what he did is known, now does it?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">They replied, “You’re not a Galilean-sympathizer too, are you? Check into it
        and—you’ll see—no prophet from Galilee gets brought to prominence.”</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">The Pharisees then said, “You’re stating claims about yourself; your claims

      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus formulated a reply, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“If I state claims about

        began to say, “No, no, he just looks like him.”That fellow proceeded to say, “Uh-uh, it’s me.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They proceeded to say, “How did you gain your sight?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That fellow replied, “The man called Jesus made some mud and rubbed it on my
        eyes and told me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">‘Go on over to the Siloam pool and wash yourself
        off.’ </STYLE>So I left, washed myself, and gained my sight.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12"><BR art="x-nl"/>They said, “Where is that fellow?” He then says, “I don’t know.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They then take him (the person who used to be blind) to the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the day of the week that Jesus made the mud and gave him his sight was Saturday—the
        Sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>So the Pharisees asked him once again, “How
        did you gain your sight?”He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed myself off, and now I
        can see.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/>Then some of the Pharisees proceeded to say, “This guy—this…this
        person—is not from God, since he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”But others proceeded to say, “How
        can a person who’s a sinner perform such miracles?” And they split into factions over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they then say to the blind man, “What do you have to say about him, since
        he gave you your sight?” He said, “He’s a prophet.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So now, the Judeans didn’t believe what was being claimed concerning him, that
        he was blind and gained his sight, until they called for the parents of the man who gained his
        sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19"><BR art="x-nl"/>They questioned them, “Is this fellow your son, whom you’re
        saying was born blind? So how is it that he can see now?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">His parents comeback was, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born
        blind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but we don’t know how it is that he can see now, nor do we know who gave him
        his sight. Ask him, he’s an adult. He can speak for himself now.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His parents said these things because they were consumed with the fear of the
        Judeans. The fact of the matter is that the Pharisees had already decided that if anyone should
        profess that he is the Messiah, the Christ, he’ll be excommunicated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">This is the reason his parents said, “He’s an adult, ask him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They then called for the man, the one who was blind, a second time and said
        to him, “Come clean on this and tell us the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So that fellow answered, “I have no idea if he’s a sinner. But what I do know
        is that I was blind and now I can see.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So they said, “What did he do to you? How did he grant you your sight?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He replied, “I told you already and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear
        it all over again? Surely you too don’t want to become his disciples, now do you?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they gave him a tongue-lashing, “You’re that guy’s disciple?—We’re disciples
        of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses and that this is recorded in the Old Testament
        Law of Moses, but we don’t know if this guy needs to get his head straightened out.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The man retorted, “What’s so amazing about this is that you don’t know if he’s
        a wacko or not, but he granted me the ability to see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">We know that God doesn’t pay any regard to sinners; on the other hand, if someone
        is devout and does His will, he’ll give him regard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">From the beginning of time, no one’s ever heard that someone granted sight to
        a person who’d been born blind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">If this fellow isn’t from God, he wouldn’t have been able to go about doing
        any miracles.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">They took this in and told him, “You were born entirely into various sins, and
        you have the audacity to instruct us?” And they shunned him from religious society.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus heard that he’d been shunned, hunted him down, and said, “<STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Do
        you believe in the Man?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">That fellow replied, “And who would that be, sir, so that I may believe in him?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Both the one you’ve seen and the one
        you’re talking to—that’s him.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He said, “I believe, sir!”, and prostrated himself before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I came into this world to settle a matter,
        so that those who can’t see would see and those who do see would become blind.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him,
        “We’re not blind too, are we?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Jesus told them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“If you were blind, you’d be sinless.
        But at this moment you’re asserting that you can see. Your sin sticks to you.”</STYLE></VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a certain person who was laid out with an illness, Lazarus of Bethany,

      <VERS vnumber="2">Now it was Mary who poured oil over the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair,

      <VERS vnumber="4">Upon hearing this, Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“The illness you’re

      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">so when he heard that he was ill, he loitered in the area for two more days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then, after this, he then says to the disciples, “<STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Let’s
        go back to Judea.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The disciples tell him, “Teacher, at the moment the Judeans are trying to stone
        you to death, and you want to head on back again?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“There’s twelve hours of daylight per

      <VERS vnumber="13">Now Jesus had spoken about his death; those disciples, however, thought that
        he was talking about actual sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So then Jesus said to them plainly, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Lazarus is dead,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">and I’m glad I wasn’t there for your sake, in order

      <VERS vnumber="17">So Jesus went and found that he’d already been in the tomb for four days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now Bethany was not too far from Jerusalem, just over 1¾ miles/2.7 km.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many Judeans had gone to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their

      <VERS vnumber="25">Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I am the resurrection and the life.

      <VERS vnumber="27">She then says, “Yes, Lord. I reached the point where I believe that you yourself

      <VERS vnumber="28">Having said this, she left and in private called for her sister Mary, “The Teacher

      <VERS vnumber="29">Right as that woman heard, she quickly got herself up and proceeded to go to
        him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Jesus hadn’t yet arrived in town, but instead was still at the place where Martha
        met him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so the Judeans who were with her in the house consoling her, seeing that Mary
        got up in a hurry and left, followed her, thinking she was headed out to the tomb in order to
        weep there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32"><BR art="x-nl"/>So Mary, as she went to where Jesus was, saw him, fell at his
        feet, telling him, “Lord, if you’d been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thereupon Jesus, as he saw her crying, her and the Judeans who came with her,
        groaned deeply within his spirit and was deeply disturbed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>“Where have you placed him?”</STYLE>They
        then say, “Lord, come take a look.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Jesus wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">So the Judeans proceeded to say, “See how close of a friend he was?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Some of them said, “Could not this fellow, who granted sight to the blind, have
        done something to prevent him from dying?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So Jesus once more groaned deeply within himself and then arrives at the tomb.
        Now there was a cave there, and a stone lying at its entrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39"><BR art="x-nl"/>Jesus then says, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>“Remove
        the stone.”</STYLE>The sister of the deceased, Martha, then says, “Lord, he’ll be reeking by
        now; it’s been four days, you see.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Jesus then says, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Did I not tell you that if you
        were to believe, you would see the glory of God?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They removed the stone. Jesus lifted his eyes upwards and said, “Father, I thank
        you that You hear me this once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I have known that You always listen to me—that aside, on account of the crowd
        which is standing around I said, ‘In order they might believe that You sent me’.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43"><BR art="x-nl"/>Once he said these things, he cried out in a loud voice, <STYLE
        css="color:#FF0000">“Lazarus, come out!”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">He who had died exited the tomb, feet bound and hands wrapped, and his face
        wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus then says, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Loose him and let him
        go his way.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Many of the Judeans who went to Mary’s place and witnessed what he did believed
        in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Some of them left, went to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">So the Pharisees and Chief Priests gathered together, convened a council, and
        proceeded to say, “What are we going to do, since this man performs so many miracles?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">If we let him keep doing this, everyone will eventually believe in him, and
        the Romans will take both the sacred place—the temple—and the nation of Israel as well away from
        us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">A certain one of them, someone notable, Caiaphas, high priest for that year,
        told them, “You all don’t know a thing—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">you certainly haven’t figured out that it’s beneficial for everyone for one
        man to die on behalf of the people rather than for the entire nation to be destroyed.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Now he hadn’t said this by his own volition, but rather, being that year’s high
        priest, he prophesied that he was intending for Jesus to die on behalf of the nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">and not just for the nation alone but in order that the children of God, the
        scattered ones, also be gathered into one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So from that day on, they began to conspire in order to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">So Jesus no longer went about in public among the Judeans, but departed from

      <VERS vnumber="55">Now the Jewish Passover was coming up and many from the area went down to Jerusalem

      <VERS vnumber="56">They kept searching for Jesus, and while standing around in the temple they
        kept saying to one another, “What do you think? Think he won’t come to the festival?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">The chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order that if anyone were

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom
        he, Jesus, raised from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">so they held a dinner for him there; Martha was doing the serving, but Lazarus
        was one of the ones relaxing at the table with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Mary takes a can’s worth of fragrant ointment—the pure, genuine expensive
        stuff— poured it on his feet, and wiped his feet off with her hair. The house was filled with
        the ointment’s fragrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who was going to facilitate his
        arrest, then says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">”Why exactly wasn’t the ointment sold for $30,000 and the proceeds donated to
        the poor?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now he didn’t make this remark about the poor because he gave a hoot about them,
        but because he was a thief and, being in charge of the purse, carried the donations around non-stop.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Let her be, so that she gets

      <VERS vnumber="9">A huge crowd discovered that he was there in Bethany, and they came by, and not
        just because of Jesus but also so that they could catch a glimpse of Lazarus, whom he raised
        from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the chief priests determined to kill Lazarus too,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">because, on account of him, many of the Judeans kept on departing from their

      <VERS vnumber="12">The next day, the huge crowd which had come to the festival heard that Jesus

      <VERS vnumber="14">Jesus acquired a not-yet-fully-grown donkey and mounted it, according to what’s

        they then remembered that these things were written in exact reference to him and that these
        things were done for him by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then the crowd that was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and
        raised him from the dead kept attesting to the miracle’s validity.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Prior to the Passover festival, Jesus had known that the time had arrived for
        him to depart this world and cross over back to the Father. He loved his own who were in the

      <VERS vnumber="2">The devil had already lodged himself in the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot

      <VERS vnumber="1">After saying these things, Jesus, together with his disciples, departed to the

      <VERS vnumber="2">Judas, the one who’ll facilitate his arrest, was familiar with the place, since
        Jesus and his disciples had gathered there often,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">He said that in order that the remark, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“not a single

      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter, in possession of a sword, hauled it out and struck the Chief Priest’s

      <VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the Chief Priest’s staff
        was familiar with that disciple, and he entered into the Chief Priest’s courtyard together with

      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood outside at the doorway. So the other disciple, the one whom

      <VERS vnumber="19">The Chief Priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I have spoken to the world publicly

      <VERS vnumber="22">After he said these things, one of the attendants who was standing there slapped

      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas sent him tied up to the High Priest Caiaphas.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the one Peter cut the ear off,

      <VERS vnumber="27">Again Peter denied it, and without delay a rooster crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They took Jesus away, taking him from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace complex.
        Now it was early morning the next day, and they didn’t enter the palace complex, so that they
        wouldn’t be defiled by having contact with Gentiles but instead could partake of the Passover
        meal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29"><BR art="x-nl"/>So Pilate left the complex and went outside to them, and they
        conversed: “What charge do you bring against this man?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Mustering a response, they told him, “If this guy hadn’t done anything wrong,
        we wouldn’t have brought him to you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31"><BR art="x-nl"/>So Pilate told them, “Take him and prosecute him according to

      <VERS vnumber="32">The transferring of the sentencing to the Romans happened in order that Jesus’s
        statement which he made be fulfilled, in which he indicated what kind of death he was going to
        die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33"><BR art="x-nl"/>So Pilate went back into the complex, called for Jesus, and
        told him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Are you saying this of your own accord
        or <STYLE fs="italic">repeating what </STYLE>others told you about me?”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate replied, “I’m not a Jew, now, am I? Your own people and the high priests
        have handed you over to me. What have you done?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“My Kingdom is not of this world.
        Had My Kingdom been of this world, my entourage would have put up a fight so that I wouldn’t

      <VERS vnumber="37"><BR art="x-nl"/>So Pilate said to him, “So you’re not a king?” Jesus replied,

      <VERS vnumber="38"><BR art="x-nl"/>Pilate then says, “What is truth?” After saying this, he once
        again left the complex to go to the Judeans and then tells them, “I find nothing to charge him

      <VERS vnumber="39">Now, by custom I free one person on the Passover, handing him back over to you.
        So have you decided that I should free the King of the Jews?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They yelled out again and again, “Not this guy—Barabbas instead!” (Barabbas
        was a thug).</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of John chapter 18 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate took Jesus and had him whipped,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">plus the soldiers weaved a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head and
        clothed him in clothing one finds on a nobleman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They proceeded to go up to him and say again and again, “Pleased to meet you,
        King of the Jews,” and slap him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Once more Pilate left the complex and then says to them, “Hey, I’m taking him
        outside, removing him from the complex, so that you understand that I haven’t found anything
        to charge him with.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the nobleman’s clothing. He then
        tells them, “Here he is—the man of the hour.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>When the chief priests and their attendants saw

      <VERS vnumber="7">The Judeans answered, “We have a code of law, and according to this code he has
        to die, since he made himself out to be a son of God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So when Pilate heard this remark, he feared all the more,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl"/>reentered the complex, and then says to Jesus, “Are you out of
        your mind?” Jesus didn’t reply.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate then says, “You won’t talk to me? Don’t you know that I have the authority
        to acquit you or the authority to crucify you?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“You don’t have any authority at all

      <VERS vnumber="12"><BR art="x-nl"/>As a result of this, Pilate proceeded to try to find a way to
        release him. The Judeans yelled out, “If you set this guy free, you’re not Caesar’s friend. Everything
        ‘the king’ himself has done is in defiance to Caesar.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate heard these words, brought Jesus out, and seated himself upon the judgment
        seat at a place called the Stone Pavement (which is Gabbatha in Aramaic).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14"><BR art="x-nl"/>Now it was around noon on the preparation day which occurs on

        we have no king,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/>So he then handed him over to be crucified. They laid hold of
        Jesus</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and, lugging his own cross, departed for something called Skull Place (which
        in Aramaic is Golgotha),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and two others with him, one here and one there, with
        Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In addition, Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross; on it was written,
        “Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek, so that many of the Judeans who
        were near the city where Jesus was crucified could read what was written on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The Judean chief priests proceeded to tell Pilate, “Don’t write ‘The king of
        the Jews,’ but instead write, ‘This guy said, “I’m the king of the Jews.”’”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate replied, “What I’ve written, I’ve written.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothing, divided them into
        four parts, one part for each soldier, and they divided up the undergarment. Now the undergarment
        was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>so they
        said to one another, “Let’s not rip it into pieces, but we’ll play a game of chance for it instead
        and one person will win it,” in order that the verse of Scripture be fulfilled:They divvied up
        my outer garments among themselvesAnd they tossed dice for my inner garmentSo—yes—the soldiers
        did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now Jesus’s mother stood there next to Jesus’s cross; so did his mother’s sister,
        as well as Mary wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing next to
        her, close at hand, available should she need anything, then says to his mother, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Lady,
        take a look at your <STYLE fs="italic">new </STYLE>son.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Take a look at your
        <STYLE fs="italic">new </STYLE>mother.”</STYLE> And from that time onwards, the disciple took
        her into his household as one of his own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After these things happened, Jesus saw that everything had already arrived at
        the finishing point. In order to fulfill the Scriptures, he then says, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“I’m
        thirsty.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">A container full of wine was lying there, so a sponge-full of wine was put on
        a stick and put to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When he took the wine, Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“It’s finished,”</STYLE>
        leaned his head to one side and passed away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Since it was the day of preparation for the Passover, the Judeans asked Pilate
        if they could break their bones into tiny pieces and take them away, so that the bodies wouldn’t
        remain on the crosses on the Sabbath, since that Sabbath was a high day, being the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So the soldiers came and fragmented the bones of the first man and the bones
        of the other man, those crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came for Jesus, as they saw that he’d already died, they didn’t
        fragment his bones;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">instead one of the solders pierced the side of his rib cage with a spear, and
        blood and water came out right away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">One person who had seen this went on record to verify that this did actually
        happen, and his testimony is trustworthy, and that fellow knows that he’s telling the truth,
        so that you all too would believe that this happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">In fact, these things happened so that the verse of Scripture would be fulfilled,
        “Not a single one of his bones will be broken,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">and not only that but another verse which says, “They will look at the one they
        pierced.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After these things happened, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus who but
        for fear of the Judeans concealed the fact, asked Pilate if he could take Jesus’s body away,
        and Pilate permitted it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Nicodemus—he who came to him at night—came too bringing a mixture of myrrh
        and aloes, about 75 lbs. (33 kg.).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So they took Jesus’s body and wrapped it in fine linen with the aromas, according
        to the Jewish burial custom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the garden
        was a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So on account of the Jewish day of preparation and because the tomb was nearby,
        they then put Jesus in it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now on Sunday, while still dark, Mary Magdalene comes early to the tomb and sees

      <VERS vnumber="2">So she runs and comes to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus had, throughout,
        a close friendship with and tells them, “They took the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know

      <VERS vnumber="3">So Peter and the other disciple left and started towards the tomb.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">In response to it all, Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Jesus then tells him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Because you’ve given me a

        seen and make the decision to believe.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So, yes, Jesus performed many miracles and a variety of them in front of his
        disciples, ones that aren’t recorded in this book of the Bible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these miracles have been recorded so that you all would acquire faith that
        Jesus is the Messiah—the Christ—the Son of God, and so that, while faith is being acquired, you
        would have that special life through the authority vested in him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Jesus manifested himself once more to the disciples at the
        Sea of Tiberias. Now this is the way he made his appearance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Simon Peter; Thomas (i.e. “Twin”); Nathanael, who was from Cana, Galilee; the
        sons of Zebedee; and two of his other disciples were together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter then tells them, “I’m going fishing.” They then say, “We’re coming
        with you.” They left, boarded the boat they used for fishing, and caught nothing that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it had already become early morning. Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples
        however didn’t know it was him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Jesus says, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Boys, you don’t have anything that’s
        edible—<STYLE fs="italic">namelyfish—</STYLE>now do you?”</STYLE> They replied, “No.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Cast the net over the starboard side
        of the boat, and you’ll get some.”</STYLE> So they cast the net and could barely haul it in due
        to the huge number of fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple whom Jesus loved and loved then says to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”
        Simon Peter, after he heard that it’s the Lord, took off the coat which was wrapped around him
        (he was naked underneath, you see) and dove into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the other disciples came in with the boat, seeing that they were not far
        from land, no, not far at all, only about 100 yards/90 meters away, dragging the net full of
        fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As they got out onto the dry ground, they see a charcoal fire spread out over
        the ground and grilled fish laid on top of the fire, plus bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus then tells them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Pull out the fish that you
        caught just now.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net full of enormous fish onto the
        land, 153 in all. The net didn’t tear, even though there were so many fish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Jesus then tells them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Come have breakfast.”</STYLE>
        Now none of the disciples dared to question who he was—they knew he was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jesus then comes and takes the bread and passes it out to them, and the grilled
        fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is the third time Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from
        the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When they finished with breakfast, Jesus then says to Simon Peter, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR
        art="x-nl"/>“Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”</STYLE><BR art="x-nl"/>He tells
        him, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you as a close friend does.”He then tells him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Feed
        my lambs.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/>He then says a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love
        me?” He then tells him, “<STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>Yes, Lord, you know I love
        you as a close friend does.”</STYLE>He then tells him, “Be a shepherd to my sheep.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He then says a third time, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000"><BR art="x-nl"/>“Simon
        son of John, do you love me as a close friend does?”</STYLE>Peter was grieved that he said to
        him a third time, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Do you love me as a close friend?”</STYLE><BR art="x-nl"/>
        He then says to him, “Lord, you know all things; you understand that I love you as a close friend.”
        Jesus then says to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Feed my sheep.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18"><STYLE css="color:#FF0000">”I’m telling you the honest-to-goodness truth—I really
        am: when you were a young man in your late teens, you got yourself ready <STYLE fs="italic">for
        the day ahead of you </STYLE>time and time again and went here and there, wherever you wanted.
        But when you do finally grow old, you will stretch your hands out and another will get you ready
        and will carry you where you don’t want to go.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He said this signifying and insinuating what sort of death he will glorify God
        with. After he said this, he then tells him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“Follow me, <STYLE fs="italic">evenin
        death</STYLE>.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Peter turns to face and look at the disciple who was following them, the one
        whom Jesus loved and loved, the person who also was the one leaning against him at the dinner
        they had and said, “Lord, who’s your betrayer?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Looking at this fellow, Peter then says to Jesus, “Lord, now what about this
        fellow?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jesus then tells him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“If I were to want him to remain
        <STYLE fs="italic">on the earth</STYLE> until I come <STYLE fs="italic">back again</STYLE>, what’s
        it to you? You follow me <STYLE fs="italic">even in death</STYLE>.”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So this statement circulated among the comrades, that that disciple won’t ever
        die. Now Jesus didn’t tell him that he wouldn’t die, rather, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“If I
        WERE to WANT him to remain…”</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple, the one who’s going on record and giving an official account
        about these things and the one who’s writing this book of the Bible. And we know that his official
        account is trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there’s a lot of other things that Jesus did, so many so that if every detail
        were to be written down one-by-one, my hunch is that there wouldn’t be enough room in the world
        to store all the scrolls that would be written.</VERS>

        the same manner which you’ve observed him travelling into the sky.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They then returned to Jerusalem from what’s known as the Mount of Olives, which
        is near Jerusalem, about a half-mile/1 km down the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they entered the city, they went to the top floor of where they were staying,

      <VERS vnumber="15">During the span of time they were up there, Peter stood up in the midst of the
        comrades (and there was a group consisting of 120 grown men, the figure not including the women,

      <VERS vnumber="2">Devout men buried Stephen and mourned greatly for him during the period of mourning

      <VERS vnumber="8">Much joy took place in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now a certain man named Simon used to awe the Samaritans in the city by practicing

      <VERS vnumber="13">Simon himself also believed and, once baptized, while sticking like glue to
        Philip and seeing spectacular miracles and tremendous miracle-working abilities, kept on becoming
        more and more enchanted by having been dazzled over and over again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now once the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had whole-heartedly embraced
        and acted upon God’s word, they sent them Peter and John,</VERS>

        existed in a state where they had been baptized into all that the Lord Jesus stands for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid hands on them and they began receiving the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Simon, seeing the Spirit given through the apostles’ laying on of hands, offered

      <VERS vnumber="25">So then they thoroughly presented and spoke about the concept of the Lord and
        returned to Jerusalem, and many Samaritan towns began to have the good news proclaimed in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now an angel spoke to Philip, “Head on out south on the road which runs from
        Jerusalem to Gaza, the one that nobody uses.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He got going. Out of nowhere an Ethiopian man appeared, a eunuch who had control

      <VERS vnumber="29">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up to him and join his chariot.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Philip ran over to him and heard him reading out of the prophet Isaiah, and

      <VERS vnumber="31">He said, “Ya, about that. How would I be able to unless someone walks me through
        it?”, and he asked Philip to climb aboard the chariot, sit down together with him, and help him

      <VERS vnumber="32"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>The passage of Scripture

      <VERS vnumber="35">Philip opened his mouth and, from this passage of Scripture, began to tell him

      <VERS vnumber="36">As they were going down the road, they stumbled across some water, and the eunuch
        said, “Look—water: what’s stopping me from getting baptized?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He ordered his chariot to come to a halt, and both of them—Philip and the eunuch—got
        off the chariot and went into the water, and Philip baptized him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When they got out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took hold of Philip and
        redirected him, and the eunuch didn’t see him anymore; you see, he was going his way rejoicing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Philip wound up in Azotus, and while travelling through there kept on proclaiming

      <VERS vnumber="26">After arriving in Jerusalem, he kept attempting to join up with the disciples,

      <VERS vnumber="27">So Barnabas got ahold of him and brought him to the apostles and told them all

        “Dorcas.” She was teeming in good works and in donations to the poor, which she was constantly
        contributing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">During that timeframe she happened to get run-down with an illness, becoming
        sick to the point of death and eventually dying. They bathed her and put her in the top floor
        of a building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Lydda being close to Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was over there and
        sent two men to him asking him earnestly—begging him, “Hurry up! Come over to our place!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Peter got up and went with them and, once he arrived, was ushered up to the
        upper floor. All the widows stood next to him crying and showing the oh-so-many tunics and cloaks
        which she was in the habit of making while she was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Peter pushed everyone out of the room, and got on his knees and prayed and turned
        to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes and, seeing Peter, sat up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He gave her a hand and got her up. He called for the set-apart-people and presented
        her alive from the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He got hungry and had a hankering to eat. While they were getting the noon meal
        ready, what happened is that he fell into a trance</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and sees that the sky had been opened up and sees an object something like a
        huge, four-cornered cloth sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">on top of which was every type of four-footed animal, were reptiles, and were
        birds from the sky—In other words, all sorts of animals which, according to Jewish kosher laws,
        Jews are forbidden to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Out of nowhere a voice addressed him, “Get to it, Peter: slaughter and eat them.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter said, “No way, sir, since I’ve never eaten anything which isn’t kosher.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Again a second time a voice from the sky spoke to him, “The item which God has

      <VERS vnumber="17">While Peter was turning things over in his head, being stumped at what the vision
        he’d witnessed could possibly mean, out of nowhere the men who were sent by Cornelius stopped
        at the gate asking around about Simon’s house,</VERS>

        What’s the reason you’ve come?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and a Jewish-sympathizer—plus
        well-spoken-of and respected by the whole Jewish race—was divinely instructed by an angel to

      <VERS vnumber="26">Peter got him up by saying, “Get up: me—I’m just a human being.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Conversing with him, he entered the house and discovered that a lot of people

      <VERS vnumber="28">and said to them, “You understand that it’s forbidden for a Jewish man to associate
        with or visit someone of another race. But God showed me that the item which has been purged

      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore, I had no objection to coming when you sent for me. So let me ask:
        what reason have you summoned me?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Cornelius said, “Starting four days ago up until this very moment we were praying
        just like we pray during the Three-in-the-Afternoon-Prayer-Time in my house, and—just like that—a
        man dressed in white appeared out of nowhere and stood in front of me</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayers and donations have percolated upwards to
        where they’ve garnered God’s attention, and He’s quite pleased by what He sees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So now, send some men to Joppa and send for Simon who goes by Peter. This fellow’s

        oh-so-powerful-dose of the miracle-working power of the Holy Spirit, who then, since God was

        oppressed by the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">We ourselves are eyewitnesses to all that he did in the country occupied by
        the Jews and in Jerusalem—he that they hung on a wooden cross-beam and killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">God resurrected this fellow on the third day and caused him to be seen by the

        hand-picked beforehand by God—that is us—the very people who ate and drank together with him
        after his resurrection from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He commanded us to preach to the folk-people and to solemnly testify that this

      <VERS vnumber="43">To this end, all of the prophets affirm the receiving of forgiveness of sins
        through his authority and what he stands for…”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was still in the middle of saying this, the Holy Spirit fell (i.e.
        they were baptized in the Holy Spirit by the Spirit manifesting Himself in a strong, sudden way
        inside of them, to the point of having trouble keeping control of themselves) on everyone who
        was listening to the message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">The believers who were dedicated to a strict form of Judaism who accompanied
        Peter were flabbergasted because the offering—the gift—of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was
        poured out on the Gentiles, those who are not Jewish by birth or by conversion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter reacted
        to what had happened,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">“Surely water for someone to be baptized in can’t be denied to these people,
        particularly those who received the Holy Spirit just like we did?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He commanded that they be baptized by the authority of of Jesus Christ. After

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the apostles and comrades over in Judea heard that the Gentiles too and not

        with them.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Peter proceeded to explain to them what happened, explaining it in sequential
        order:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">“I was in Joppa praying and had a vision while in a trance: the vision was of
        an object something like a huge, four-cornered cloth sheet descending out of the sky, and it

      <VERS vnumber="6">I stared at it and started to notice what was there: I saw the gamut of four-footed

        spiritual malaise, you and your entire household.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While I was just getting started talking, the baptism in the Holy Spirit fell

      <VERS vnumber="19">So now, those who were scattered because of the pressure due to the persecution

        the prophet Samuel came on the scene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from
        the clan of Benjamin, for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Once he was removed, He brought David to prominence, making him their king.
        He went on record and said about him, ‘I found David son of Jesse, a man after My heart, one

      <VERS vnumber="27">The fact is, those who live in Jerusalem along with their rulers, not acknowledging

      <VERS vnumber="42">While they were saying goodbye, they kept pleading with him to speak to them

      <VERS vnumber="43">Once they were dismissed from the synagogue service, many of the Jews and the
        devout proselytes to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas. While certain ones of them in particular
        were speaking face-to-face with them, Paul and Barnabas kept on persuading them to continue in
        the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">On the following Sabbath, almost the entire city gathered together to hear the

        to say things in opposition to what was spoken by Paul, contradicting him and blaspheming him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">Hearing this, the Gentiles proceeded to rejoice and to glorify the Word of the

      <VERS vnumber="50">The Jews incited the pious women, the ones who were prominent and who were leaders

      <VERS vnumber="51">They wiped their hands of it and went to Iconium,</VERS>

    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 13 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In Iconium events occurred along the same lines: they introduced themselves to
        the members of the synagogue and affiliated themselves with it in order to speak before the synagogue
        so that a great many Jews, and not only they but Greek-speaking Jews, would become believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Jews who weren’t converted to the faith went on the offensive against them
        and polluted the minds of the Gentiles, pitting them against the comrades.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then they stayed a good deal of time speaking openly about the Lord, testifying
        about the message of his grace, allowing miracles to take place through their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The majority of the population was divided: on the one hand there were those
        of the Jews’ camp; on the other hand there were those of the apostles’ camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Spontaneously and impulsively, both the Gentiles and the Jews were joined by
        their rulers and decided to attack them and stone them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Realizing what was going on, they got out of there and fled to the cities of
        Lycaonian, Lystra and Derbe specifically and to the surrounding area.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There they continually shared the good news, the good news of the Gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There was a certain helpless man in Lystra—unable to use his legs—who kept on
        sitting on the ground all the time, lame from the time he was born, one who hadn’t walked around
        even once.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This fellow heard Paul speaking; after Paul stared at him, and while staring
        sees that he has the faith to escape his affliction,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">he said in a loud voice, “Get up on your feet and stand straight up!”—and he
        proceeded to do just that: he sprung up and walked around,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and seeing what Paul did the crowd raised their voices in the Lycaonian language
        saying, “The gods came down to us in the form of these men!”—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they proceeded to call Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul “Hermes,” since Paul did
        most of the talking—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the priest of Zeus, whose temple is situated right before you get to the
        city, brought bulls and the garlands that sacrificial animals are adorned with to the city gates
        and, joined by the crowds, was itching to perform sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their garments to
        show how upset they were and rushed out into the crowd yelling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">“Men, why are you doing this? We too are men who experience passion and pain
        the same way you do, while at the same time telling you the good news of turning away from these
        worthless things to a living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything along
        with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who in the bygone generations permitted people everywhere to go their own way
        and do their own thing—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and yet He didn’t leave them void of evidence pointing to Him being up in heaven
        doing good things and being kind, giving you that sweet rain which makes for productive growing
        seasons, the food injecting gladness into your hearts until your hearts are filled to the brim.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Saying these things just barely caused the crowd to stop performing sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived, talked the crowd into stoning Paul,
        did just that, and dragged him and dragged him until they got outside the city, thinking he was
        dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">While his disciples were standing around him in a circle, he got up and went
        back into the city. The next day he left for Derbe accompanied by Barnabas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and after he proclaimed the good news of the Gospel to that city and made a
        decent number of disciples there, returned to Lystra, then to Iconium, and then to Antioch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">getting the life-being of the disciples to rely on the Lord, encouraging them
        to stick with the faith and advising them by saying that a lot of difficulties and intense pressure
        will occur and must be endured in order to succeed in their life of faith (enter God’s kingdom).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now having prayed, combining fasting with the prayer, he went church by church
        and appointed presiding boards, and the Lord kept on adding more people to those who had already
        come to believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and after speaking the Word of God in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they started the trip, and were
        commended for the mission they accomplished by the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">After getting there and gathering the church together, they proceeded to report
        what God did, as He was with them on the trip, and to report that He opened a door of faith for
        the Gentiles (i.e. He created an opportunity for the Gentiles to join the faith).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They continued to spend time—and no small amount of it—with the disciples.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 14 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="15">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A few key people came over from Judea and proceeded to tell them how things ought
        to be done, instructing the comrades that you’ve got to be circumcised in Moses (i.e. become
        Jewish and commit to obeying the commandments in the Law of Moses), or else you can’t be saved
        (i.e. receive Christ and walk with him).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">No small disagreement and debate occurred between Paul and Barnabas on one side
        and them on the other, and they arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and certain others from among them
        to go to the apostles and the presiding board in Jerusalem in regard to this debate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then those sent forth by the church kept creating tremendous joy among the
        comrades as they were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria recounting the Gentiles’ conversion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Arriving in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the
        presiding board, and reported what God was doing in conjunction with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now a few who belonged to the Pharisee-sect and who had become believers stood
        up to speak and said that the Gentile believers must be circumcised (and thus convert to Judaism)
        and be ordered to adhere to the Law of Moses,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the apostles and the presiding board got together to look into this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl"/>After much debate took place, Peter stood up and told them: “Men,
        comrades: you understand that from the very start (our start that is), God chose that the Gentiles
        hear the Gospel through my mouth and become believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God, the Knower-Of-The-Heart, went on record and told them that He would give
        them the baptism of the Holy Spirit just like He gave it to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After their hearts were cleansed by faith, no one discriminated against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So at this point in time, you’re trying God’s patience (testing God) by placing
        an unnecessary burden on the disciples (putting a yoke on the disciples’ necks), one which neither
        our ancestors nor we were strong enough to bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">No—it’s through the grace of the Lord Jesus that one exercises faith to be saved
        from their sin following the same pattern as those people did.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The whole lot of them fell silent and began to listen to Barnabas and Paul explain
        the miracles that God did among the Gentiles through them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After their silence, James responded, “Men, comrades, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Simon explained the way that, for the first time, God paid a visit—a caring,
        helping type of visit—in order to form a unique group of people from out of the Gentiles, a people
        consecrated to everything He represents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The words of the prophets agree with this, as it’s written:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>”’After this occurs, I will
        return And rebuild David’s fallen condoAnd rebuild what remains of itAnd restore it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>So that what’s
        left of the people Just might seek out the Lord,Plus all of the Gentiles upon whomMy mark of
        ownership was assigned to,’Says the Lord who’s doing this</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and Who’s been making this known from eternity past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">”Therefore I decided not to bother those who are of Gentile origin who are turning
        to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but instead to write them letters which tell them to abstain from the detestable
        things forbidden by of the Law of Moses: from things polluted by idols, from bizarre sexual immorality,
        and from drinking the blood remaining in the body of an animal after it’s been killed by having
        its neck broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You see, going back to ancient times, the Law of Moses has always had those
        who preach it, as it’s being read aloud in the synagogues in city after city, Sabbath after Sabbath.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the apostles and the presiding board in conjunction with the entire church
        decided what was best to do and chose men from among them to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch,
        namely Judas, who goes by Barsabbas, and Silas, men who were leaders among their comrades,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23"><BR art="x-nl"/>and wrote a certified letter so there would be no doubt of its
        authenticity, “The apostles and the presiding board, comrades: to the comrades up and down Antioch,
        Syria, and Cilicia, those who are of Gentile origin. Greetings!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because we heard that some of our own people have of their own initiative ventured
        out and troubled you with remarks unsettling to your mind, people who have not been issued instructions
        to do so,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">all of us were in agreement in deciding what was best to do and chose comrades
        to send you who will accompany our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">men who have dedicated their lives to to all that our Lord Jesus Christ stands
        for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same as what is written
        here through word-of-mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The fact is, the Holy Spirit and we thought it best not to make you shoulder
        any more burden than these items which we’re listing here, which are absolutely necessary:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from slaughtering an animal with the
        intent of drinking its blood, and from bizarre sexual immorality.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So then, once they were released, they went up to Antioch, gathered the community
        of believers together, and gave them the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">After it was read they rejoiced at the advice, exhortation, and encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Judas and Silas as well exhorted and encouraged the comrades by means of many
        short prophetic messages (they being prophets in their own right) and put them on a firm footing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After putting in time there, they were released in good standing from the comrades
        back to the ones who sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Paul and Barnabas continued on in Antioch teaching and evangelizing the Word
        of the Lord, and many others did too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return to the cities in which
        we proclaimed the word of the Lord and go from city to city visiting the comrades there and see
        how they’re getting on in their faith.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now Barnabas was wanting to take Mark (i.e. John who goes by Mark) along with
        them too,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">but Paul was thinking it fitting not to take Mark along, the guy who deserted
        them, leaving them at Pamphylia and ceasing to accompany them on their mission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A sharp disagreement took place to the point where they parted ways from each
        other, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Paul called on Silas to accompany him and left, after being handed over to the
        Lord’s grace for safe keeping by the comrades.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He went on and on passing through Syria putting the churches on a firm footing.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 15 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul arrived in Derbe and then in Lystra and stumbled across a particular disciple
        there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer in Christ but whose father
        was a Greek-speaking westerner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">whose good reputation was attested to by the comrades in Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wanted this fellow to leave with him, and took him to get circumcised (symbolizing
        his conversion to Judaism and the beginning of his obeying the Law of Moses) because of the Jews
        that were in that locale. You see, they all knew that he had a father who was a westerner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As they were travelling through the cities, they committed themselves to keeping
        an eye on the issues that had been decided by the apostles and the presiding board in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So then the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing
        in number day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After passing through Phrygia and the province of Galatia, they were prevented
        from speaking the Word by the Holy Spirit in the Roman province of Asia, in which Phrygia is
        located and which borders Galatia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After they went over to Mysia, they kept on trying to go to Bithynia, but the
        Spirit of Jesus didn’t allow them to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">After making an appearance in Mysia, they went over to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A vision was seen by Paul over the course of a night: some Macedonian man stood
        planted in one place begging him, “Cut across the Aegean Sea to Macedonia and help us out.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Like he saw in the vision, we immediately sought to depart for Macedonia surmising
        that God had summoned us there to evangelize them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They sailed from Troas straight to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and from there to Philippi, which is a leading colony-city in that part of Macedonia.
        We were keeping at it in this city for a number of days,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and on the Sabbath we went out the city gates and down by the river, figuring
        it would be a good place to pray. We sat down and proceeded to speak to the women who had formed
        a group there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A particular woman named Lydia, a dealer in luxurious cloth, a Thyatirian sympathizer
        and near-convert to Judaism, was listening and listening, as the Lord opened her heart to heed
        what was being spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As she was baptized (and her household was too), she asked earnestly, “If you’ve
        come to the conclusion that I’m faithful to the Lord, come stay at my house,” and she wouldn’t
        take “no” for an answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now it so happened as they were going to a prayer meeting, that some teenage
        servant-girl who had a spirit of divination accosted them, one who brought her bosses a hefty
        sum of money by telling fortunes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She followed Paul around and kept on yelling, “These men are servants of the
        Most High God, ones who are proclaiming what you need to do to set things right with God,” about
        them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and she kept this up for several days. Paul, exasperated, turned to the spirit
        and said, “By the authority vested in me by Jesus Christ, I command you to leave her!”—and it
        left her that moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Seeing that any hope of generating income departed when the spirit departed,
        her bosses seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the main town square to where the rulers
        were.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They brought them to the magistrates and said, “These here men are agitating
        our city, seeing that they’re Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They proclaim—impose upon us—sets of rules which are impermissible for us to
        embrace, seeing that we’re Romans.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The crowd joined in on attacking them. The magistrates flew off the handle and
        ordered them to be beaten with rods,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and after wounding them with many blows threw them in jail and ordered the jail
        keeper to lock them up tightly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">who, once he received such a stern order, shuttled them deep inside the jail
        and put their legs in stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Towards the middle of the night while Paul and Silas were praying, they kept
        on singing praises to God (and the prisoners kept hearing from them).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">A severe earthquake took place suddenly, one of such a magnitude that it shook
        the foundation of the jailhouse, and immediately all the doors were opened, and all of the stocks,
        chains, and fetters were unfastened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The jail keeper was awakened, and seeing all the jail’s doors opened, drew his
        sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that all the prisoners had escaped,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">but Paul called out to him in a loud voice, “Don’t hurt yourself; we’re all
        still here, you see.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He called for a torch, ran in, and, trembling, fell before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved from my wretched
        spiritual and moral condition?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your household will be saved,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and he told him the Word of the Lord, him together with his entire household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">At that moment in the middle of the night he took them into his personal care
        and dressed their wounds. With no further delay he was baptized, he and all who were under his
        authority,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and he brought them upstairs to his apartment and sat them down at his table
        and put out a spread of food. He rejoiced with his entire household, as they all arrived at the
        point where they had faith in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Now days went by and the magistrates sent the constables saying, “Let those
        men out now.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The jail keeper informed Paul, “The magistrates have sent word so that you can
        go free. So at this time, leave and go in peace (i.e., go your way free of conflict, duress,
        or affliction).”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Paul said to the jail keeper, “They beat us in public without a decision handed
        down from a court proceeding—men who are Roman citizens—threw us in jail—and now they want to
        kick us out of jail in secret? No—not a chance—have them personally come over and bring us out
        themselves.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The constables told the magistrates these remarks; those who heard this became
        afraid that they’re indeed Roman citizens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">They came and pleaded with them, brought them out, and kept on asking them to
        leave the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">After leaving the jail, they went to Lidia’s house and were hosted there, and
        once they saw comrades, they comforted them, and they finally departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 16 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonis, they came to Thessalonica,
        where there was a synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For three Sabbaths Paul went to the synagogue and approached those who meet in
        the synagogue, as he was his habit of doing, and reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">going through detail after detail, example after example presenting to them that
        the Messiah, the Christ, had to suffer and be raised from the dead and that this person Jesus
        is the Messiah…”The one I’m making known to you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of them were persuaded and joined in with Paul and Silas, including a great
        many of the devout, God-fearing westerners (i.e., Greek-speaking near-Jewish converts), and no
        small number of the leading women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Overtaken by the passions of jealousy, the Jews went so far as to recruit some
        hooligans from the hangouts in the middle of town, formed a mob out of them, and proceeded to
        cause a commotion. After attacking Jason’s house, they started to try to parade them over to
        the rabble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the comrades
        over to the city officials, all the while shouting, “Those guys who’ve ripped through the civilized
        world like a tornado have arrived here,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">the ones Jason has taken in as guests. All these guys engage in activities that
        violate Caesar’s ordinances, claiming that there’s a different king named Jesus.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Hearing this disturbed the crowd and the city officials,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and they collected the fine commensurate for the crime from Jason and from the
        rest of them and released them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wasting no time, the comrades immediately sent both Paul and Silas away to Berea
        during the night, who, after arriving and while being away, went to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these people were more open-minded, better educated, and had more sophisticated
        thought processes than the Thessalonians, being individuals in particular who were totally gung-ho
        to embrace the Word, who day after day examined the Scriptures to see if all these things which
        Paul preached were in fact true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, many of them believed, including many of the prominent westerner-women
        and men—no small number in total.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now as the Jews from Thessalonica became aware that the Word of God was being
        proclaimed in Berea, they went there as well to shake up the crowds and to cause them to feel
        disturbed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Immediately then the comrades sent Paul away, having him walk until he reached
        the ocean, while Silas and Timothy remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Those who escorted Paul escorted him until they got to Athens and received an
        order from Paul destined for Silas and Timothy that they should leave and come to him as quickly
        as possible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While Paul was waiting for them to arrive, his spirit was provoked and enraged
        seeing the city overrun with idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">so then he kept on reasoning with and disputing with the Jews and the devout
        sympathizers of Judaism in the synagogue and day in, day out with whoever happened to be in the
        city square.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers engaged him in a discussion;
        some proceeded to say, “What point is this dilettante-intellectual here trying to make?”, but
        others said, “He seems to be a preacher who preaches about weird imps.” They were saying this
        because he was spreading the word about Jesus and his resurrection,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus council on Mars
        Hill, saying, “May we get up to speed on what the new-fangled teaching taught by you is all about?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You see, what you’re filling our heads with is strange, so we wish to understand
        how this fits into the big picture.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(Now all Athenians and foreigners who reside in Athens have no time for anything
        other than talking about or hearing about something novel.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Paul stood in center-stage before everyone at the Areopagus and said, “Men,
        Athenians, what I observe of you is that you’re exceptionally devout in every regard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">you see, looking up at your objects of veneration while passing through, I ran
        across an elevated-altar on which is inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’ You offer up religious devotion
        to that which is unknown to you, so I’ll have you know this:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world and everything in it—this sky and earth that you
        see all around you—is a lord who does not dwell in man-made temples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor needs the hands-on attendance of healing treatments, as He Himself gives
        life and breath and everything to everyone and everything,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and in addition made all the nations, races, and ethnic groups that you see
        living all over the planet out of one person, after delineating arranged seasons and the extent
        to which they linger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and made all the nations to seek after God if perchance they might reach out
        to touch and handle Him and in so doing find Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>You see, in Him we live and are set in motion and
        have our existence, as some of your own poets have stated too,“For we are God’s offspring indeed</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">”So an offspring which gets its existence from God ought not consider the Divine
        Deity to be comparable to a figure of some sort made with gold, silver, or stone, a craftsman’s
        sculpture and the reflection of a person’s conceptualization.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So then, having overlooked the epochs of ignorance, at this time God is ordering
        all people everywhere to go about having a change of heart and of ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because a day has been marked on the calendar in which He’s going to judge the
        civilized world from the perspective of Him being always right and of Him expecting people to
        do right— judge the world by a man whom He designated, offering assurance to everyone that this
        is indeed the case by having resurrected him from the dead.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Once they heard “life-after-death” (i.e. the resurrection of the dead), some
        began to sneer, but others said, “We’d like to hear from you on this subject again, for sure.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And with that, Paul left center-stage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now some of the men joined up with him and became believers, among whom were
        Dionysius, a member of the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 17 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Paul got himself away from Athens and went to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He found a certain Jew by the name of Aquila, who grew up in Pontus but had recently
        come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, who had both come because of Claudius’s order to expel
        all the Jews from Rome, and went to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Being of the same trade, he proceeded to take up residence near them and to start
        working. In this regard they were tent makers by trade.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He kept on reasoning and trying to win over those in the synagogue every Sabbath,
        Sabbath after Sabbath, and was persuading Jews and westerners time and again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As they (Silas and Timothy) came over from Macedonia, Paul continued to devote
        himself to the preaching of the Word, solemnly declaring to the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As they were deployed against him hurling abuses, he shook out his clothing signaling
        his having nothing to do with them and said, “You’re to blame for your own destruction! I’m wiping
        my hands of it! From now on, I’m going to the Gentiles.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He left there and was taken into the home of someone named Titius Justus, a pious
        God-worshipper, whose house was next-door to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the synagogue head Crispus came to have faith in the Lord together with his
        entire household, and hearing this, many of the Corinthians started to have faith in the Lord
        and were being baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord spoke to Paul at night in a dream, “Don’t fall into fear—no—keep on
        talking and don’t fall silent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">because I am with you and no one can lay a hand on you to harm you, because
        a dedicated group of people are with me—a great many of them—in this city.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So for a year and a half he filled the role of teacher among them, teaching
        them the Word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While Gallio was the Roman proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, united in heart, mind,
        and purpose, jumped Paul and brought him to the courtroom where Gallio sat as judge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying “This guy uses the Law of Moses to convince people to not be piously
        devoted to God and to not worship Him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Just as Paul was about to open his mouth to speak, Gallio said to the Jews,
        “Oh you Jews! If this really was some wrong-doing or nefarious crime, I would’ve put up with
        this from you while complying with the methodology of a court proceeding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But issues concerning concepts, authority, reputations, law, etc. that are specific
        to you are to be monitored by you; I do not wish to be a judge who decides these matters,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and dismissed their case.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Everyone got ahold of the synagogue head Sosthenes and began to beat him right
        there in the courtroom, and Gallio had no intention of doing anything about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Paul continued to stay with the comrades for a good number of days more, said
        goodbye to them, and proceeded to sail to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila, after shaving
        his head in Cenchreae, since, you see, he was holding fast to the restrictions that come with
        an Old Testament pledge called a Nazirite vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They arrived in Ephesus, and he left those others there, but he for his part
        went to the synagogue and proceeded to reason with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they asked him to stay for an even longer time, he wouldn’t acquiesce,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but said goodbye instead, “If it’s God’s will, I’ll come back and visit you
        again” and put out to sea from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After he went down to Caesarea and went over and greeted the church, he went
        down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">After spending some time there, he left and went through one part of Galatia
        after another and Phrygia too, putting the disciples on a firm footing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now a certain Jew who grew up in Alexandrian named Apollos, a man who was quite
        the scholar, arrived in Ephesus, being proficient and capable in the Scriptures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This fellow was schooled in the Way of the Lord, and as he was fervent—boiling-over
        really—in the Spirit, he went about speaking and kept meticulously teaching on the subject of
        Jesus, understanding John’s baptism only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">In addition this fellow began to speak boldly and freely in the synagogue. Once
        Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and correctly explained to him the Way of
        the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As he was wanting to tour in Achaia, prompted to do so the comrades wrote a
        letter of recommendation to the disciples there to receive him, who when he arrived was joined
        in tight unison with those who had become believers through the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The fact is, he kept on overwhelming the Jews in public with refutations, vehemently
        showing with specifics through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 18 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now what happened when Apollos was in Corinth was that Paul passed through the
        highland districts and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples off to the side there</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>and said, “Did you get the baptism in the Holy
        Spirit now that you’ve become believers?”They replied, “Not only did we not receive it, but we’ve
        not heard of there being a baptism in the Holy Spirit.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3"><BR art="x-nl"/>And to that Paul said, “What have you been baptized into (i.e.,
        into what covenant have you been initiated)?” They said, “Into John the Baptist’s baptism.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, “John’s baptism was an initiation into a covenant of a change of heart
        and of ways, while at the same time he was baptizing he was telling the people to look to the
        Coming-One who comes later so that they would believe in him. This person is Jesus.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After hearing this, they were baptized by the authority of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them as they were
        baptized in the Holy Spirit, and along with that they began speaking in tongues and speaking
        Holy-Spirit-inspired words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All told, there were about twelve men (not including women and children) there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">After he introduced himself to the synagogue and became affiliated with the people
        there, for three months he proceeded to openly and freely reason with and attempt to convince
        the members about things pertaining to God’s involvement with mankind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As some kept on getting more and more resistant and turned-off, bad-mouthing
        the Way in front of the majority, he parted ways with them and pulled the disciples away, while
        day by day reasoning in the lecture forum in Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now this occurred for two years, to the extent that everyone living in the Roman
        province of Asia heard the Word of the Lord, both Jews and westerners,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and God kept performing miracles through the hands of Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">even to the extent that cloths, handkerchiefs, and tradesman’s aprons which
        he had bare-skin, physical contact with which were taken from him, and when laid over those who
        were run-down from an illness or whatnot, the diseases left them, and the Evil Spirits went out
        of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were these roaming Jewish exorcists who attempted to invoke the delegated
        authority of the Lord Jesus Christ over people who have Evil Spirits by saying, “I exorcise you
        all by the authority of Jesus whom Paul preaches!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now there were seven sons of a certain Jewish chief priest named Sceva doing
        this to an Evil Spirit one day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Evil Spirit replied to them, “I’m familiar with Jesus and I know about
        Paul, but who are you?”,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and the man who had the Evil Spirit in him assaulted them and dominated and
        overpowered them to the extent that they fled the building half-naked, bruised, and beaten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This became known to all the Jews who were living in Ephesus and to the westerners
        as well, and fear fell upon all of them, and what the Lord Jesus is all about began to be magnified,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and many of those who had become believers began confessing out loud what their
        sinful habits are, telling everyone about them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A sizeable number of those involved in the occult gathered their books together
        and burned them up in front of everyone. When they added up the cost of the books, they arrived
        at a figure of $6.25 million.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In this way—according to the Lord’s awesome power—the Word kept on growing and
        getting stronger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">As these things ran their course, Paul determined by the Spirit to go through
        Macedonia and the Roman province of Asia in the course of going to Jerusalem, having said, “After
        I’ve been there, I’ve got to see Rome too.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He sent two of his helping-assistants, Timothy and Erastus, on ahead, while
        he, on the other hand, stayed back for a period of time in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Meanwhile, no trivial disturbance took place with regard to the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You see, a certain fellow by the name of Demetrius, a silversmith by trade who
        made silver shrines of the Greek goddess Artemis which generated a not-so-insubstantial income
        for the guild,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">gathered everyone connected with this line of work together and said, “Gentlemen,
        you know that our well-being comes from this trade,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and you see for yourself that this Paul-guy is talking a good number of people
        in Ephesus—and in nearly all of Asia—into disregarding and shunning our handiwork, claiming that
        man-made objects are not gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Not only does this threaten that our profession will become disreputable, but
        it also threatens that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will lose all of its prestige
        and all this will wind up destroying her magnificence, she whom the entire province of Asia and
        the civilized world worships.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Once they heard this, they were filled with rage and shouted, “The Ephesians’
        Artemis is awesome!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The city was filled with turmoil, and, once they caught Paul’s Macedonian travelling
        companions Gaius and Aristarchus, they all together rushed to the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Paul was wanting to engage the mob, but the disciples wouldn’t let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Some of the public officials, being his friends, sent word to him begging him
        not to venture into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some kept shouting one thing, some another thing. The fact is, the throng was
        confused; most of them didn’t know why they’d gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The crowd pinned the blame on Alexander, who was pushed to the front by the
        Jews. Alexander motioned to the mob with his hand so that he could begin talking his way out
        of the situation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Recognizing that he’s a Jew, for about two hours they shouted a singular chant,
        “The Ephesians’ Artemis is awesome!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">After hushing the crowd, the city clerk said, “Gentlemen, fellow Ephesians,
        show me one person who doesn’t know that the Ephesians’ city is home to and protector and custodian
        of Artemis the Awesome, the image which fell down from Zeus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Since this is absolutely the case, we’ve got to settle down and not do anything
        rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You see, you brought these men who are neither temple-robbers nor blasphemers
        of our goddess here against their wills.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now if Demetrius along with his fellow tradesmen really have a complaint to
        levy against anyone, there’s such a person called a ‘proconsul’—let them take it before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if that’s not good enough for you, whatever it is you’re wanting to have
        done will have to be resolved through the court system.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">The fact is, based on what’s taken place today, we’re in jeopardy of being accused
        of rioting, since we have no good excuse for what we’ve done.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">After he said this, he dismissed the throng.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 19 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the riot stopped Paul sent for the disciples, and once he encouraged them
        and after a going-away get-together, he left for Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After passing through those parts and encouraging them with many a message, he
        went to Greece,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and after he’d put in three months there, a plot by the Jews against him materialized
        while he was about to set sail for Syria; he wound up making the decision to return via Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now accompanying him were Pyrrhus’s son Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus
        from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the Roman province
        of Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These fellows went out ahead and waited for us in Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We set sail from Philippi after the multi-day Feast of Unleavened Bread ended,
        and by the time five days or so went by met up with those in Troas, where we stayed on for seven
        days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On a Sunday when we gathered to break bread (i.e., have a communion meal while
        enjoying each other’s company), Paul kept on explaining to them in depth the logic behind what
        he taught, pointing out to them the logical fallacies of the opposing points of view, and in
        general covering a given subject with them from top to bottom. Because he was planning on leaving
        the next day, he was lengthening the lesson until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the upstairs room in which they were gathered, there were enough lamps
        to provide a sufficient amount of lighting,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and there was a teenager there named Eutychus sitting on the window sill who
        fell deep asleep while Paul was going into more and more explanations, and who, when he was woken
        up, fell out of the third floor and was pronounced dead on the spot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul went down, vigorously attended to him, took him in his arms, and said,
        “Don’t make a commotion—he’s alive, you see.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He went back up, prayed over the meal, ate to his heart’s content, and spoke
        until dawn: That’s the manner in which he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They took the lad away—and he was alive when they did—and were relieved in no
        small way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We went on ahead and got on the ship and sailed to Assos, intending to take
        on Paul there as a passenger; you see, he had arranged for things to be done that way, while
        he himself planned to travel by foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he met us in Assos, he boarded, and we went to Mitylene,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and from there caught an outbound wind the following day and arrived at a place
        across from Chios. The following day we cut across to Samos, and the day after that arrived in
        Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You see, Paul had weighed the options and decided to sail past Ephesus, in order
        to not waste time in Asia; the fact is, he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem in time for the
        Pentecost holiday, if possible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From Miletus Paul sent a message to Ephesus and summoned the church governing
        board together to meet with him when he got there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they met up with him, he told them, “Starting with the first day I set
        foot in Asia, you know how I’ve spent the entire time with you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord in total humility and self-abasement and in tears and during
        the hard times of the plots fomented against me by the Jews,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">as I did not shirk a bit in telling you the things which are a benefit to you,
        teaching you in public and indoors privately,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">solemnly declaring to both the Jews and the Gentiles a change of heart and of
        ways in relation to God and declaring faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Take note of this: I’ve been compelled by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem; what
        I’ll be confronted with there, I do not know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Nevertheless, in city after city the Holy Spirit solemnly goes on record to
        tell me that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But—no—I have not uttered a peep about how precious my life is to me as I finish
        my race and complete the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to thoroughly declare
        the good-news-message of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">”Take note of this: I know that all of you—you whom I was preaching the Kingdom
        of God to while passing through the area—will never set eyes on me again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I’m going on record this very day to say that I can’t be blamed for
        the destruction of the lives of anyone,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">for I have not shirked in telling anyone the will of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be mindful of yourselves and of the entire flock of Christians whom the Holy
        Spirit put you as overseers (or bishops) over, leading God’s church, a church which he acquired
        through his very-own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know that monstrous wolves will join up with you after my departure, penetrating
        your inner-circle, not sparing the flock,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and men will arise from among you who speak distorted, perverted, and corrupted
        things, causing some of the disciples to commit apostasy by becoming their followers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore be continuously and vigilantly on the lookout, remembering that day
        and night for three years I did not take a break from warning every last one of you—warning you
        in tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">”At this time I commit you to God and to the concept of His grace, to be edified
        by the Power (the miracle-working power in fact) and for God’s end-goal plan for your lives to
        be granted among those who’ve been set apart and have been made holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Any kind of cash, checks, or clothing I desired from no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You’re personally acquainted with the fact that my own hands attended to my
        needs and subsistence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I’ve pointed all this out to you so that you participate in like manner in the
        toil of helping those who are weak (perhaps weak because of a sickness of some sort) and to remember
        the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to go about giving than
        to go about receiving.’”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">After he said these things, he dropped to his knees to pray with all of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">A good amount of crying by everyone took place, and they wrapped their arms
        forcefully around Paul’s neck and kept on kissing him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">in agony most of all because of the message which he spoke that they would never
        set eyes on him again. They then proceeded to put him on the ship and send him off.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When it came time to set sail, once we were torn away from them, we set a straight
        course and came to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Finding a ship that was making the run straight to Phoenicia, not hugging the
        coast, we boarded and sailed off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Cyprus appeared over the horizon, we kept it on our port side and kept on
        sailing to Syria and docked at Tyre, seeing that the ship was destined to unload its cargo there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Seeking out and finding disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Those disciples
        in particular kept on telling Paul through the Spirit to not go down to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When those days were up, we left there and started walking, with everyone having
        a send-out for us, joined by their wives and children, until they got outside the city walls.
        At the shore we dropped to our knees and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We tore ourselves away from each other and boarded the ship, and those good people
        returned to their kinfolk and fellow citizens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For our part, we finished taking the ship from Tyre and arrived in Ptolemais,
        greeted the comrades and spent a day with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The next day we left and went to Caesarea, and were invited to stay at Philip
        the Evangelist’s house (Philip being one of the original seven directors chosen in the early
        days), and stayed with him as his guests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This fellow had four unmarried daughters who prophesied on a regular basis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">While staying put there for plenty of days, a certain-someone from the Judean
        church—a prophet named Agabus—came over from Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">approached them, took Paul’s belt off, tied his own hands and feet with it,
        and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirits: The Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this
        belt the same way as this and hand him over to the Gentiles to be put in custody by them.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, we and the locals as well advised him—begged him—not to
        go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Paul then replied, “What are you all doing crying and breaking my heart? Fact
        is, I’m ready to not only be bound but also to be killed in Jerusalem, on behalf of all that
        the Lord Jesus stands for.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Not making any progress in talking him out of it, they quieted down and said,
        “May the Lord’s will come to pass.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After this stretch of time was over, we made preparations and proceeded to go
        to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us as well, bringing us to a
        certain Cyprian named Mnason, whom we were to stay with, a disciple who had been around for a
        long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we showed up in Jerusalem, the comrades gladly received us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The next day Paul—we—met up with James and the entire church governing board.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Once greetings were exchanged, he explained down to the last detail what God
        had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Those who heard this glorified God and told him, “You see, comrade, how many
        tens of thousands there are within the Jewish community who have become believers, and all of
        them are zealous to be in compliance with the Law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The word’s going around about you that you’re instructing all the Jews to abandon
        the Law of Moses and live like Gentiles, telling them not to circumcise their boys and in refusing
        to do so, not enrolling them into Judaism nor to live a lifestyle of keeping the ancient traditions
        that go hand-in-hand with following the Law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So what’s the story here? Everyone’s going to hear that you’ve come to town
        and will be sifting through every statement you make which they hear through the grapevine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">”So this is what you should do: There are four men who have voluntarily taken
        the Old Testament pledge called the Nazirite vow and are partway through it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Befriend them, perform Jewish purification rituals with them as a group and
        pay their expenses until they reach the end of their vow when they’ll shave their heads, and
        everyone will know that the word-on-the-street about you is baloney, and you live uprightly instead
        and keep the Law of Moses for your own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now about the Gentiles who’ve become believers: we disseminated the decision
        to obey the following list of rules: to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from slaughtering
        an animal with the intent of drinking its blood, and from bizarre sexual immorality.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Paul then befriended the four men, and on the following day, once he was ritualistically
        purified, entered the temple complex with them, letting everyone know the days of ritualistic
        purification had been checked off, until such a time that the prescribed offering was offered
        by each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As the seven days were about to come to an end, the Jews from the Roman province
        of Asia saw him in the temple and proceeded to stir up everyone in the crowd, and they grabbed
        ahold of him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">while shouting, “Men, fellow Israelites, help: this is the man who’s teaching
        everyone everywhere a teaching which is in opposition to what the folk-people believe and is
        against the Law of Moses and this very place. What’s more, he brought Gentiles into the temple
        and defiled this holy place.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">You see, they had seen the Ephesian named Trophimus in the city with him beforehand,
        and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple at some point.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The entire city was perturbed, and the folk people formed a stampede, and forcibly
        taking hold of Paul, they proceeded to drag him outside the temple complex, and the temple gates
        were immediately shut behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And while trying to kill him, a report was dispatched to the colonel of the
        Roman garrison posted in the city that the entire city of Jerusalem was on the move.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He immediately gathered soldiers and junior officers to his side, chased them
        down, and cornered them. Seeing the colonel and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Next, the colonel drew near, took custody of him, spoke out an order that he
        be tied up with two chains, and inquired who he might be and what it is that he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some of the people in the crowd were shouting one thing at them, some were shouting
        another. Unable to understand what was going on because of the riot, he ordered that he be brought
        to the garrison’s base.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when they got to the stairs, they found that he was being carried by the
        soldiers on account of them being pressured by the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You see, a multitude of the folk-people were shouting, “Get rid of him!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And while they were about to enter the base, Paul said to the colonel, “May
        I say something to you?” He said, “You know Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So that means that you’re not the Egyptian who a few months ago stirred up a
        rebellion and lead the 4,000 men from the terrorist organization out into the desert.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Paul said, “I certainly am a Jew, from Tarsus, Cilicia, a citizen of a not-so-insignificant
        city. I’m asking you to return me to the folk-people and speak to them.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Paul turned around, went back, stood on the stairs, and motioned with his hand
        for the crowd to be silent. Once the crowd was quiet, he addressed them in Aramaic…</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 21 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">…”Men, fellow comrades, and patriarchs: listen to my side of the story now.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Once they heard him addressing them in Aramaic, they gave him their attention
        all the more. He then goes on to say,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, Cilicia, raised in this city as an understudy of
        Gamaliel, having received tutelage down to the minutest detail from the foremost expert in the
        Law of Moses, being zealous of God in the same way that you all are today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I kept on persecuting those in the movement called This Way to the point of death,
        subduing them and putting them in jail, both men and women alike.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">As the high priest vouched for me (and every one of the councilmen too), and
        along with that I also received letters of authorization addressed to the comrades in Damascus,
        I proceeded to go bring those who lived up there too to Jerusalem, all tied up, so that they
        would be forced into submission, thoroughly crushing their will to resist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">”What happened to me sometime around midday while walking and approaching Damascus
        is that a light from out of the sky suddenly shined around me, a light like a spotlight consisting
        of a continuous lightning flash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl"/>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“‘Saul,
        Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8"><BR art="x-nl"/>”I replied, ‘Who are you, sir?’ “He told me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">‘I’m
        Jesus of Nazareth, whom you’re persecuting.’</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">”Now those who were accompanying me saw the light indeed, but didn’t hear the
        voice which was speaking to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><BR art="x-nl"/>”I said, ‘What do you want me to do, sir?’ <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">“The

      <VERS vnumber="11">”As I had lost my sight due to the glory of that magnificent light, I was led

        that very moment I looked up at him and was able to see again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, ‘God of our ancestors appointed you to know His will and to see the
        One Who’s Right and to hear the sound of words coming from His mouth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And what are you going to do now? You’re going to get up and get ready to be

        known for.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">”What happened to me after returning to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple
        is that I found myself in a trance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I saw him telling me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem—quickly
        now—because they are not having anything to do with what you’re saying about me.’</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I said, ‘Lord, they know that I was going from synagogue to synagogue imprisoning

      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the blood of your advocate and representative Stephen started to be

      <VERS vnumber="22">Now they were listening to him attentively up to the previous statement, and

        this doesn’t deserve to live!”,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and screamed and went absolutely ballistic.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The colonel ordered that he be brought into the base, and said a few words for
        him to be whipped as part of an interrogation, in order to ascertain the reason he was being
        shouted at like this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25"><BR art="x-nl"/>As he stretched him out with the leather straps positioning
        him for the scourging, Paul said to the centurion standing there,“Is it legal for you all to

      <VERS vnumber="26">Upon hearing this, the centurion went over to the colonel and reported it, “What
        in the world are you about to do? This here man’s a Roman citizen.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27"><BR art="x-nl"/>The colonel came over and said, “Tell me—are you a Roman citizen?”
        Paul said, “Yes.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28"><BR art="x-nl"/>The Centurion answered, “I acquired this citizenship of mine
        with a large sum of money.” Paul said, “But as for me—I was born into mine.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As a result, those who were about to interrogate him immediately backed away.
        The centurion became frightened knowing beyond a shadow of doubt that he’s a Roman citizen and
        that he had been tied up illegally.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">A council was convened the following day to ascertain the facts of what he was
        being accused of by the Jews. He let him out, summoned the high priest and the councilmen to
        attendance, brought Paul down from the base, and had him stand before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 22 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul looked intently at the council and said, “Men, comrades, with a good conscience
        in every respect I have lived my life for God up to this day.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The high priest Ananias had the ones standing next to him hit him in the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul then said to him, “God’s going to hit you back, you bogus judge. And to
        think that you presume to sit in judgment over me according to the Law of Moses, but you hit
        me illegally.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The attendants who were standing nearby said, “You’re insulting God’s high priest,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and so Paul goes on to say, “I didn’t know, comrades, that he’s a high priest.
        You see, it’s written in Scripture, ‘You shall refrain from speaking ill of a ruler of the people.’”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Realizing that one part of the council consisted of Pharisees but the other part
        consisted of Sadducees, Paul shouted to the council, “Men, comrades, I myself am a Pharisee,
        the very product of Pharisees—I’m on trial for the hope that life after death offers!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Once he said this, a disagreement broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees,
        and the majority were split over the issue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(On the one side of the dispute, Sadducees assert that there is no life after
        death, nor are there angels or spirits; whereas Pharisees profess the opposite.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Heavy back-and-forth shouting took place, and so some of the designated teachers
        who were on the Pharisees’ side stood up and said in hot contention, “We find that this man has
        done no wrong. If a spirit spoke to him, or perhaps an angel, …”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">With quite a quarrel breaking out, the colonel was growing anxious over Paul’s
        safety lest Paul be torn to pieces by them and ordered a company of soldiers to come down out
        of the base and snatch him from their midst and bring him to the base.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That night the Lord stood over Paul as he was lying in bed and said, <STYLE
        css="color:#FF0000">“Don’t sweat it. You see, just as I kept on telling you in all seriousness

      <VERS vnumber="12">When day came, the Judeans formed a cabal and swore an oath amongst themselves
        promising not to eat or drink until they killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty who took this oath as part of the cabal,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and these men approached the high priest and the council and said, “We took
        an oath amongst ourselves, swearing that we would be cursed if we break it, not to enjoy even
        a morsel of food until we kill Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So have an audience before the colonel now, you and the council with you, and
        petition him to bring Paul down acting as though you’ll be investigating his case in detail.
        We’ll be ready to bump him off before he ever gets close to you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Paul’s nephew (his sister’s son) heard about the ambush, was escorted to the
        base, was granted access, and informed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul called one of the centurions over and said, “Send this young man to the
        colonel, as he has something to tell him.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He did indeed take the young man into his custody and brought him to the colonel
        and said, “The prisoner Paul called me over and asked me to bring this young man who has something
        to tell you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The colonel clasped his hand and took him aside so that they could talk in private,
        and proceeded to inquire, “What is it that you have to tell me?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, “The Judeans concocted a plot to ask that you bring Paul down tomorrow
        to appear before the council as though some detail about his case is being examined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So then don’t let them talk you into this, as more than forty of their men are
        in on the plot ready to jump him, and these men swore amongst themselves to not eat or drink
        until they bump him off, and they’re ready to go as of this moment, waiting for you to give the
        word.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the colonel released the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that
        he had an audience with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He summoned two of his centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready
        to march all the way to Caesarea, plus seventy cavalrymen and two hundred javelin-throwers, with
        a departure time of nine in the evening,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and saddle up a mule so that Paul will be delivered safely to Governor Felix,
        since he’ll be mounted.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He dictated a letter which reads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">From Claudius Lysias, to his excellency Governor Felix: Greetings!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The Jews got ahold of this man and were about to kill him, but I came to the
        rescue with my soldiers. Having learned he was a Roman citizen</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and wanting to get to know the grounds on which they were accusing him, I took
        him to their council.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I discovered that he was being charged for an issue involving their law, but
        nothing that he was being charged with was worthy of death or imprisonment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now after I received a report that a conspiracy to take this man’s life was
        about to be hatched, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers to present their
        case before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So then the soldiers, following the orders they were given, took Paul and brought
        him to Antipatris over the course of the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The next day the infantry allowed the cavalrymen to part ways and continue on
        with him to Caesarea, while they returned to base.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Those cavalrymen entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor and
        presented Paul to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He read it, asked what province he’s from, and found out that he’s from Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">”I’ll give you a hearing,” he said, “when your accusers show up.” He ordered
        that he be placed under guard in Herod’s palace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Five days later the high priest Ananias arrived with some councilmen and with
        this attorney named Tertullus. They appeared before the governor in the case against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After being called on, Tertullus began the prosecution of the case saying, “A
        good deal of peace has been obtained because of you and the reforms which—owing to your foresight—you’ve
        introduced into this nation</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and which have been whole-heartedly accepted by everyone everywhere, your excellency
        Felix, with overwhelming gratitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But in order to not waste any more of your time, I beg you by the kindness you’re
        known for to listen for a moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You see, we find that this plague-of-a-man: #1—is instigating rebellions among
        all the Jews across the civilized world plus is a ringleader of the Nazarene faction;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">#2—attempted to desecrate the temple; #3—has been arrested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In regard to all of these affairs, you might want to examine them yourself to
        ascertain what it is we’re accusing him of.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews piled in alleging that this is so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul, given the nod from the governor to speak his rebuttal, replied, “From
        many years of being a judge for this nation, all the while being good-natured about getting to
        know the background material of my rebuttal,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">you have the wherewithal to come to the realization that, from the time I left
        to travel to Jerusalem to worship there, no more than twelve days have gone by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Jews have not found me wrangling with anyone in the temple or exerting pressure
        which I fomented out of a group of people in the temple, nor doing the same in the synagogues,
        nor going from city to city doing the same,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">neither can they present evidence to you pertinent to the accusations they’re
        leveling against me at the moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I hereby state the following to you: the religious beliefs I adhere to and worship
        the Father-God with are in accordance with ‘the Way’ (which they say is a sect of Judaism), in
        every respect exercising faith consistent with the Law of Moses and believing in what’s written
        in the rest of the Old Testament,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope in God, a hope which they too entertain for themselves, a soon-to-be
        afterlife of the righteous and—well—the unrighteous too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I apply myself to this as well, in order to maintain a blameless conscience
        through it all towards God and towards my fellow comrades.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">”As I had repeatedly over many, many years went to the temple and gave donations
        to the poor among my fellow-countrymen, I arrived in the temple bringing offerings and donations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They found me in the temple with these offerings and in a state of ritualistic
        purification—but did not find me with a crowd or with rioters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Some of the Jews from the Roman province of Asia—who ought to have to appear
        before you personally and submit accusations if they have some sort of complaint against me—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">or should be made to state in person before you that they found some misconduct
        that warranted standing me before the council—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">unless of course it’s all about this one squawk which I shouted out while I
        stood in their midst, ‘I’m on trial before you today over the doctrine of life after death!’—”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Felix adjourned the proceedings, knowing in detail the ins-and-outs of the Way
        from observation, and said, “When Colonel Lysias manages to get here, I’ll get to the bottom
        of your claims,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">while ordering the centurion to keep an eye on Paul while he let him relax and
        ordering him not to prevent any of his personal attendants from attending to his needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A few days later Felix appeared with his wife Drusilla (who was Jewish), summoned
        Paul, and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">While he was making the case for righteousness, self-control, and the Coming
        Judgment, Felix became frightened and responded, “You’ll have to go now, but when I get the chance,
        I’ll call for you to come back.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">All the while too, he was hoping that he was going to get money from Paul; for
        that reason too, he kept on conversing with him, summoning him frequently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now his two-year term as governor ended, and Felix was replaced by a successor
        named Porcius Festus, and wishing for the Jews to owe him a favor, in the transition Felix kept
        Paul imprisoned.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 24 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Festus assumed his tenure as governor over the region and went from Caesarea
        down to Jerusalem three days later,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and the chief priests and the leading Judeans informed him of the accusations
        against Paul and proceeded to ask him to step in</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and do a favor for them in their case against Paul, that he be extradited to
        Jerusalem, as they were preparing an ambush to bump him off while on the way down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As a result Festus decided to keep Paul in Caesarea, while he himself was planning
        to leave Jerusalem soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So he then says, “Let those of you who can make things happen accompany me and
        indict him of crimes if there turns out to be some discrepancy with this man.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He spent no more than eight to ten days with them and went down to Caesarea.
        The next day he convened court as the presiding judge and called for Paul to be brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he showed up in court, the Judeans who had come up from Jerusalem brought
        lots of severe charges against him, but the case for any of them was not strong enough to stick,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">while Paul, speaking in his own defense, said, “I have not committed any infraction
        with respect to the Jews’ Law of Moses, nor with respect to the temple rules, nor with respect
        to Roman law.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, wanting to do a favor for the Judeans so they would owe him one,
        replied to Paul, “Do you want to go down to Jerusalem and hold the trial for all of this down
        there with me as judge?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, “I have taken a stand in the Roman court of law, where my trial must
        be held. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you have come to know so well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So now, if I am indeed guilty of doing something worthy of death, I won’t make
        excuses for getting the death penalty. But if nothing comes of what they’ve charged me with,
        nothing’s going to make them happy. I appeal my case to Caesar.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After conferring with his council, Festus then replied, “You have appealed to
        Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Several days went by and King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and greeted
        Festus and started hanging out with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the course of spending a lot of days there, Festus went over the charges
        against Paul with the king from top to bottom, “There’s this man who was left imprisoned by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">concerning whom the Jewish chief priests and councilmen tendered a request to
        me while I was there in Jerusalem, asking me to sentence him as though he had been convicted
        of a crime.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To which I replied that to surrender and hand over a given person before the
        defendant faces his prosecutors in the same physical location and submits testimony in his own
        defense against the charges is not the Roman way of doing things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">”So they came up here, and without delay I convened court the following day,
        sat in the judge’s chair, and called for the man to be brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When it was the prosecution’s turn to present evidence, they kept on accusing
        him of violating the law, while I kept on suspecting that not a single one of the charges was
        a legitimate felony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They kept on having issues with his religious beliefs and with this certain
        fellow who died named Jesus, but that was all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I was perplexed about this ongoing debate of theirs and kept on asking him if
        he would like to go to Jerusalem and be put on trial down there for these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul appealed his case and asked that he be held in custody for the
        purpose of having the emperor decide the case, I ordered that he be held prisoner until I send
        him over to Caesar.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22"><BR art="x-nl"/>Agrippa said to Festus, “I’ve been wanting to hear what this
        man has to say myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “You shall hear what he has to say.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The next day Agrippa and Bernice—with much fanfare—went and entered the audience
        hall accompanied by a colonel and by prominent men of the city, and Festus called to have Paul
        brought out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Festus said, “King Agrippa and all the men who are joining us: see this fellow
        whom the overwhelming majority of Jews keep hitting me up about in Jerusalem and here as well,
        shouting that he must no longer live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I’ve been floored by the fact that nothing that he’s done deserves the death
        penalty, but this fellow nevertheless invoked his right of appeal to the emperor, to have his
        case transferred there for trial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I don’t have anything definite to write down on this subject for the head-honcho;
        therefore I brought him before us and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that the inquiry
        which will take place now would result in something I can write to the emperor to be read when
        he reviews this man’s case.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The fact of the matter is, I think that sending a prisoner to the emperor and
        not specifying the accusations against him is absurd.”</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Acts chapter 25 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you allowed to speak for yourself?” Paul then put
        his hand up and proceeded to issue a rebuttal:</VERS>

        myself fortunate that I’m going to be giving a rebuttal before you today,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">especially with you being an expert in anything that has to do with the Jewish
        people and in their issues and disputes as well. Therefore, I ask you to patiently listen to
        me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">”So now, all the Judeans have known firsthand the way I lived from the time I
        was a youth, namely what happened from the time it all started when I was among my fellow countrymen
        and was living in Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">knowing me the entire time then. What they would say about it if they were put
        on the stand to testify is that I lived the life of a Pharisee, adhering to the strictness of
        our religion sect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">At the moment I’m on trial standing before you defending myself for the hope
        of our ancestors’ promises, which God caused to come into being;</VERS>

        of Israel, are hoping to attain, earnestly performing rituals of worship day and night; for a

      <VERS vnumber="8">”Why have you all decided that it’s too far-fetched to believe that there’s life

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now—yes—I deemed it necessary to get personally involved in and actively participate
        in opposing everything Jesus of Nazareth stands for, and I did this a lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I did this in Jerusalem and had many of God’s very people locked up in prison,
        once I obtained the authority to do so from the chief priests, and I cast my vote for them to
        receive the death penalty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Going through all the synagogues one after another punishing them on many occasions,

      <VERS vnumber="1">As it was decided that we would sail to Italy, they proceeded to transfer custody
        of Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, a member of the Imperial Battalion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We boarded a ship in Adramyttium which was about to sail down the Turkish coast
        and hoisted sail, while Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, accompanied us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The next day we stopped at Sidon. Julius did a kind deed for Paul and permitted
        him to go to his friends and receive care for his health.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">From there we set out to sea and sailed the long way, on the eastern side of
        Cyprus, because the winds were against us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">sailed through the deep water off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, and arrived
        at the town of Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There, the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and we boarded
        it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After several days of making slow headway, we showed up over in Cnidus. Because
        the wind wasn’t in our favor, we sailed the long way around Crete down the coast of Salmone</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and with difficulty sailed along the coast and came to some place called Fair
        Havens, which is near a town called Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As a good amount of time had gone by, and it being dangerous to travel on the
        Mediterranean Sea because the Day of Atonement was already past (i.e, it was already fall), Paul
        kept on urging,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">“Men, I’m looking at what will happen, that there’s going to be damage and much
        loss—not only to the cargo and the ship but of our lives—on the voyage.”</VERS>

        saying than by what Paul was saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now since the harbor there was unsuitable for passing the winter, the majority
        decided to hoist sail and leave, if perchance they could make it to Phoenix and pass the winter
        there, which is a harbor in Crete which faces southwest and has a northwesterly wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The south wind blew gently; thinking that they had a window of opportunity,
        they lifted anchor and proceeded to sail along the coast of Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after, a hurricane called a “Northeasterly” came down from Crete
        and plowed into them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As the ship was caught in the wind and couldn’t withstand it, they lowered the
        sails and drifted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Running under the protection of a small island called Cauda, we were just barely
        able to get the ship under control preventing it from smashing into the rocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they raised the waterline of the hull, they used cables to support the
        weight of the ship and hold it together. Afraid that they might run aground on the banks of Syrtis,
        they lowered the anchor and were driven about while configured this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Battered by the storm, the next day we proceeded to jettison boxes, jars, and

      <VERS vnumber="26">But we’ll have to run aground on some island.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now as the fourteenth night came around, we were drifting about the Adriatic
        Sea, and about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were nearing land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After sounding the depth by dropping a line with a lead weight, we measured
        a depth of twenty fathoms (120ft/37m). A short while later, we measured fifteen (90ft/27m),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and fearing that we’d smash against the rocks, we cast four anchors off the
        ship’s stern and began to hope and pray for day to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Trying to flee the ship, the sailors lowered the ship’s utility boat into the
        water, pretending that they were going to extend the bow’s anchor lines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “If those guys don’t stay in the
        ship, you won’t survive.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The soldiers then cut the utility boat’s ropes and let it be driven away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Up until daylight was about to appear, Paul kept on encouraging everyone to
        have something to eat saying, “It’s been fourteen days of waiting it out now, and we haven’t
        eaten anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">With this in mind, I encourage you all to put some food in your stomach, as
        this is for your own well-being and could save your life. Fact is, not a single one of the hairs
        on your head will be lost.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">After he said this, he took a loaf of bread, offered thanks to God in front
        of everyone in the ceremony done many times before, broke it, and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Everyone cheered up and partook of food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All totaled, there were 276 of us onboard the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After they’d eaten, they lightened the ship by throwing the stores of wheat
        overboard into the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When daylight broke, they looked and looked but weren’t making out any land
        which had no rocky shoreline, but they started to notice a bay which had a suitable beach, and
        they got together and decided that it might be possible to run the ship aground on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They cut the anchors loose and let them sink to the bottom of the sea and at
        the same time disconnected the rudder controls from the rudder, hoisted the foresail to utilize
        the wind, and headed for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They encountered a place where two bodies of water converge and ran the ship
        aground. While the bow stayed firmly planted, the aft on the other hand began to break off from
        the rest of the ship due to the force of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">A plan was put together by the soldiers to kill the prisoners, lest any one
        of them escape by swimming away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">but wanting Paul to survive, the centurion thwarted their plan by first of all
        ordering those who are able to swim to the shore to jump overboard and get away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and for the others to get on a plank or something-or-another from the ship and
        paddle their way to shore. And this was the way that everyone made it to dry ground and survived.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Once we were safe, we came to the understanding that the island’s called Malta,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and the natives began to shower us with an inordinate amount of kindness: you
        see, on account of the sudden rain coming down on us and the cold, they lit a fire and welcomed
        every one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Paul gathered a bunch of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper fled the
        heat, sunk his fangs into him, and latched onto his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As the natives saw the viper hanging off his hand, they began to say to one another,
        “This guy definitely was a murderer. He escaped the sea but justice didn’t allow him to live.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So then he shook the viper off into the fire and nothing bad happened to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They kept waiting for him to swell up soon or drop dead suddenly. While they
        were waiting and looking, nothing unusual happened to him, and they changed their minds and began
        to say that he’s a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the area that surrounds that place that they were at was a piece of property
        that belonged to the most prominent person on the island, a man by the name of Publius. He took
        us into his house for three days, extending hospitality to us strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Publius’s father came down with on and off fever and dysentery which kept forcing
        him to lie down. Paul went over to him, became acquainted with him, prayed, laid his hands on
        him, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When this happened, everyone else on the island who was run down with maladies
        of some sort started coming to him and was being healed or otherwise treated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They gave us many donatives as an allowance, and while we were putting out to
        sea, they put necessities on the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Three months later we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered on the island
        of Alexandrian, a ship called “Gemini.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After we went up to Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there we sailed the circuit and arrived in Rhegium. After one day elapsed,
        a wind came up from the south, and after a second day, we went to Puteoli,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where we found fellow-comrades, and they cordially invited us to stay for seven
        days. This is the way we arrived in Rome:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The comrades then heard what happened to us and went all the way down to the
        Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and strengthened
        his nerve and stiffened his composure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now when we entered Rome, Paul was given permission to live by himself and with
        his guard-soldier.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What occurred three days later is that he summoned the leading Jews together.
        Once they got together, he proceeded to tell them, “Men, comrades, I, a prisoner who was handed
        over to the Romans back in Jerusalem, did nothing which was against the Israeli folk-people or
        the customs of our forefathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The very people who examined me kept wishing to set me free because there was
        no charge which I was inherently guilty of which warranted death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Facing opposition from the Judeans, I was forced to appeal my case to Caesar—not
        that I had any charges to press against my fellow countrymen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So I made the request to see you and to talk to you for this reason: you see,
        it’s because of the hope of Israel I’m wearing these chains.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said, “We have neither received anything in writing about you from the
        Judeans, nor have any one of the comrades showed up informing us of anything along these lines
        or saying something bad about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We would like to hear from you, for you to tell us what your thoughts are; for
        we certainly do know that this sect called Christianity is spoken against by everyone.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They reserved a day for him, and many went to visit him and were treated to
        his hospitality, guests to whom he kept on expounding and solemnly stating the truthfulness of
        God’s interaction with mankind (God’s kingdom) and making persuasive arguments for them to believe
        in various things about Jesus and to believe in various things from the Old Testament from early
        in the day until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">With him using logical arguments, they indeed kept being agreeable to his propositions
        and conceding his points, but in spite of that they refused to act in faith and believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">While in a state of disagreement with one another, they were politely told it
        was time to leave after Paul made a remark in which he said that the Holy Spirit put it beautifully
        when he spoke to our ancestors through the prophet Isaiah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>“Go to this
        people and say, ‘You will hear news of something,But there’s no way at all that you’ll understand

        something,And would understand in their heart And would redirect their lives in the right way,And
        I will heal them when they do.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">”So let it be known to you all that this rescue program of God’s was sent to
        the Gentiles; they especially will listen to it.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He lived on his own in a rented house for an entire two years, and welcomed
        as guests anyone coming to interact with him in a friendly visit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">preaching how God interacts with mankind (God’s kingdom) and teaching various

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, servant of Christ Jesus, called as a missionary, designated to God’s good
        news—the Gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">what He promised before over and over through His prophets in the Old Testament</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">about His son, who—physically speaking—came into being through the lineage of
        David,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who was declared in a powerful way to be God’s son according to the Holy Spirit
        due to the resurrection from the dead, namely Jesus Christ our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">through whom we’ve received grace and have received a missionary assignment that
        has the end-goal of obedience—a consequence of faith—among all the Gentiles and the far-off nations
        on behalf of all he stands for,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">by which you too are called by Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To God’s beloved who are holy and called of God who are in Rome: Grace be to
        you—and peace—from the Father-God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">First and foremost, concerning you I thank my God through Jesus Christ, that
        the word is being spread about your faith throughout the entire world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In fact, God is my witness, whom I offer a service of worship to in my spirit
        in the evangelization of his son, as I’m constantly making mention of you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">every time I offer up prayers, asking if somehow, sometime, I will have succeeded
        by the will of God in visiting you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The fact of the matter is that I long to see you so that I might bestow on you
        a spiritual gift, a gift whose goal is to establish you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">This bestowing of a spiritual gift is done to take comfort together with you
        through the faith shared between you and me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I don’t want you to be left in the dark, comrades, that I purposed many times
        to come to you, but I was prevented from doing so up until now, so that I would have the opportunity
        in the meantime to observe the germination and growth of tangible signs of maturity among you
        as well just I observed it in the other Gentiles—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I’m in debt not just to the civilized but to the uncivilized also, to not just
        the wise but to the foolish also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">This is what motivates me to evangelize to you too who are in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The fact of the matter is, I’m not ashamed of the Gospel, for it’s God’s power
        in all those who believe for them to end up with salvation (i.e., the state of being kept from
        from spiritual, moral, mental, and physical calamity)—and not just the Jews but the non-Jewish
        Westerners as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For in the Gospel God’s righteousness (i.e., God’s requirements of how a person
        must lead his life in order to please Him and be approved by Him) is revealed out of faith and
        back into faith, just as it’s been written in the Old Testament, “The one who’s righteous (i.e.,
        the one whose life is to be approved by God) shall live out of faith.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You see, God’s wrath is unfurled from up in the sky, up in heaven, upon ungodliness
        and unrighteousness inherent in people who withhold the truth in and by their unrighteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and it is unfurled because the knowledge of God has appeared and been made known
        to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To this point, from the inception of human society, His invisible aspects (that
        is, His everlasting power and divine nature) have been clearly seen and understood by means of
        the things which were created, resulting in all humans being without excuse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore, while knowing and understanding God, they didn’t glorify or thank
        Him as God, but became empty-headed in their reasonings instead, and their non-understanding
        heart darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Asserting to be wise, they became idiots</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and exchanged the glory of the Immortal God for the facsimile of a Mortal Human
        and of animals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So for the aforementioned reasons, as they were wallowing in the desires of
        their hearts, God handed them over to dirty and disgusting unholy things in dishonoring and disgracing
        their bodies among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">the very people who, as they were wallowing in the aforementioned lie, swapped
        the truth of God and worshipped and held religious services for the creature, circumventing the
        Creator, the One who is forever blessed (and let us pause a moment for that to sink in).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">On account of this, God handed them over to an unnatural, disgraceful, excruciating
        passion of lust. In this regard, both the women swapped the Natural Function for that which circumvents
        what comes naturally;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and the men too—and in the same manner—leaving the Natural Function of the woman,
        burning in their longing for one another, men perpetrating the disgraceful deed with men and
        receiving the corresponding reward which they have coming to them and which they were bound to
        receive due to their error, an error which they adhered to among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And just as they did not approve of retaining the accumulated knowledge and
        understanding of God, God handed them over to an unapproved mind, to do what is not fitting to
        do,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">having been filled to the brim with every kind of unrighteousness: with wickedness,
        greed, malice, they are full of envy, murder, strife, Machiavellian-styled rivalry, malevolence;
        they’re gossips and slanderers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">trash-talkers, God-haters; they’re insolent people, they’re arrogant, they’re
        braggarts, they dream up evil, they rebel against their parents,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">they’re dull-witted, treacherous, without the natural affection one has for
        parents, children, nation, etc.; they’re unmerciful—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The very people who know and understand God’s righteous precepts exactly, that
        those who practice such things deserve to die—not only do they do these things, but they’re in
        lockstep-agreement and think highly of those who practice them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Romans chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">…Which leads to this: who do you think you are, you who pronounces judgment over
        others (i.e., draws conclusions about others for the purpose of writing them off)?—There’s no
        excuse for this. The fact is, in the area in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, for
        the one who’s doing the judging practices the same thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now we know for a fact that God renders a guilty verdict in line with the truth
        against those who practice such things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You rascal, you who commits such sins and practices such things—do you figure
        that you’ll evade God’s judgment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Or while despising the riches of His goodness, forbearance and patience, you’re
        unaware that the goodness of God leads one to repentance (i.e., to change one’s heart and one’s
        ways)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But in accordance with your hard—downright unrepentant—heart, you’re accumulating
        your own individualized-wrath to be regurgitated on that date when wrath is unveiled and readily
        distributed, the day of God’s righteous judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who “will repay every person according to what that person’s done.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the one hand to those who, in accordance with a consistent pattern of good
        works, seek after glory, honor, and immortality, the repayment will be eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But on the other hand, to those who, out of an attempt to promote themselves
        by buying influence with God and out of not being persuaded and being disobedience to the Truth
        but are convinced that doing unrighteousness is alright, the repayment will be wrath and an outburst
        of rage—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Distress and anguish for every last person who leads a life of evil, Jews at
        a higher level and non-Jewish Westerners at a level below them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But glory, honor, and peace to all who lead a life of good, Jews at a higher
        level and Westerners at a level below them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The fact of the matter is that God shows no favoritism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You see, anyone at all who sinned without the benefit of possessing a law (i.e.,
        a list of God’s rules) will perish; and anyone at all who sins while immersed in a law will be
        judged by that law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To be clear, it’s not the ones who have heard a law and can spout off what it
        says who are right with God, but the ones who put a law into practice will be pronounced righteous
        by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To this point, when the Gentiles who don’t have a law (i.e., a list of God’s
        rules) instinctively do the things of the Law (i.e., the definitive, comprehensive list of God’s
        rules, which is the Law of Moses), they, though not possessing the Law, are a law (i.e., a set
        of God-given rules) for themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">These particular people point out what the law written in their hearts (i.e.,
        their particular list of God’s rules written in their hearts) has accomplished—and while pointing
        this out their consciences join in and testify even to the extent of arbitrating between the
        various differing rationales condemning or defending—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">on whatever day it happens to be when God judges the hidden things of mankind
        through Christ Jesus according to my positive message—my Gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now if you call yourself a Jew and are fixated on law (i.e., mankind possessing
        and putting into practice the definitive list of God’s rules), boast over (i.e., take pride in;
        swagger over; loudly extol the virtues of; defend vociferously) the things of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">know the will of God, and accept or reject the differing oral traditions of
        interpretation which are derived from the Law of Moses—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and all these to the extent that you’ve convinced yourself that you’ve reached
        the point where you’re a guide to the blind, a light in darkness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">a trainer to the foolish, a teacher to the young, possessing in the Law of Moses
        the embodiment of the knowledge and the truth of God—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">so now, does the one who’s teaching someone else teach himself anything? Does
        the one who preaches to others not to steal steal himself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Does the one who says “don’t commit adultery” commit adultery? Is the one who
        abhors idols a temple robber?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Does the one who boasts in law (i.e., takes pride in—to the point of bragging
        about—his ability to follow the list of God’s rules) dishonor God by the transgression of the
        Law of Moses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In fact, “God’s reputation is slandered among the Gentiles because of you,”
        like it says in the Bible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The fact of the matter is that—yes—circumcision (i.e., committing one’s life
        to following the Law of Moses) is beneficial if one were to put the edicts of the Law of Moses
        into practice, but if one were to transgress the Law, his circumcision will have become uncircumcision
        (i.e., as though he never committed himself to follow the Law of Moses).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So if the archetypical circumcised man were to keep the edicts of the Law of
        Moses, wouldn’t his uncircumcision count as circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the physically-uncircumcised man who satisfies the requirements of the Law
        of Moses will judge you, the quintessential transgressor of law (i.e., one who doesn’t fulfill
        the requirements of the list of edicts given by God), a transgressor in the midst of having a
        verbatim copy of God’s edicts and by having signed up to comply with those edicts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You see, a person is not Jewish because he appears Jewish on the outside, nor
        is circumcision a physical characteristic,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">but rather one is Jewish by virtue of what’s on the inside, and circumcision
        is of the heart done by the Spirit not by the letter (i.e., by the rigid interpretation and application
        of God’s edicts); that person’s praise is not from people but from God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Romans chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So what’s so much better about being Jewish? Put another way, what’s the advantage
        of being circumcised (i.e., being in a covenant to obey the Law of Moses)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much and in many ways. First—certainly first—is that they were entrusted with
        the safekeeping and preservation of God’s words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So now, what if some of them refused to have faith and believe? Does their refusal
        to believe cancel God’s faithfulness?—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>Don’t even think about it; think this
        instead: God is true, but every person is a liar, just like it’s written,…So You’d be absolutely
        right in Your wordsAnd come out on top in Your judgments</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now if our unrighteousness causes us to become aligned with the righteousness
        of God, what’s the takeaway? It isn’t that God, Who brings the wrath which He’s deemed justifiable
        upon select individuals, is unfair? (I’m talking about “unfair” in terms of human standards of

      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Do we have an advantage? Not entirely. The fact is, we Jews—and throw

        it addresses those who’re up to their neck in the Law, so that everyone would be left with nothing
        to say and the entire world (i.e., the entire established order of humanity) would become accountable
        to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore, what comes out of works of law (i.e., an attempt to perform the deeds
        which satisfy the requirements mandated by a list of God-given rules) is that not a single living
        being will be justified before Him (i.e., declared “not guilty” in a court of law presided over
        by God as judge); the fact is, through law comes a recognition and a precise knowledge and understanding
        of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But as it turns out, righteousness of God (i.e., a venue whereby God will approve
        of how one conducts his life) has been manifested apart from law (i.e., the reliance on pleasing
        God solely based on obeying His list of rules), as it is showcased by the Old Testament,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">a righteousness of God through Jesus Christ-faith to all who believe: there

      <VERS vnumber="23">For all have sinned and come up short of the glory of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">while at the same time being offered a gift of being justified by His grace

        place) in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">whom God determined before it all started to be a propitiation (i.e., a means

        the overlooking of the previously-committed sins</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">by the forbearance of God coupled with the demonstration of His righteousness

        the works-method?—No, but rather through a law (i.e. method) of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You see, we figure that a person’s justified by faith apart from works of law

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So what’ll we say about what we’ve discovered about Abraham, our forefather physically-speaking?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You see, if Abraham was justified (i.e., examined by a judge and declared to
        be in the right) by works, he has bragging-rights (i.e., he has the right to be proud of and
        brag about his personal achievements); but no—not with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>Taking a closer look, what does the Scripture say?
        Abraham had faith in God, and it was credited to him as righteousness</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The agreed-upon pay which the average worker earns is not awarded to him as a
        favor or as a gift to charity but as a debt which is owed and which he must be compensated for.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Contrast that to the average worker who instead of being owed a wage of righteousness
        believes in the justification of the ungodly and relies on this justification instead: his faith
        is credited to him as righteousness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">just as David too describes the blessings on the person whom God credits righteousness
        independent of works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl"/>Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven And whose
        sins have been covered over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8"><BR art="x-nl"/>Blessed is a man to whom the Lord Will definitely not impute
        sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So is this blessing upon the circumcised (i.e., those who’ve made a covenant
        to obey the Law of Moses) or the uncircumcised? The fact of the matter is that we say, “The faith
        peculiar to Abraham was credited to him as righteousness.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So how was it credited? While circumcised or uncircumcised? No—not while circumcised
        but while uncircumcised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and after being credited with righteous, he had the actual circumcision operation
        done to him, a certification of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised,
        resulting in him being the progenitor of every believer who traverses from uncircumcision (i.e.,
        them being Gentiles and consequently having no covenant with God) to their being credited with
        righteous,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and a progenitor of a circumcised person (i.e., a person who’s Jewish and consequently
        follows the Law of Moses) whose righteousness is not derived from circumcision alone but is a
        result of following in the footsteps of the faith that our patriarch Abraham had while uncircumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, the promise to Abraham or to his offspring, the promise to be the world’s
        heir, was not by means of law (i.e., a method where one follows a list of rules, with the implication
        of obtaining righteousness from it) but rather through faith-based-righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To that point, if a law-based methodology is the means by which one lays claim
        to righteousness and takes possession of it, faith has been made null and void, and the promise
        that was given to Abraham has been nullified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Law of Moses brings about wrath, you see, but where there is no law (i.e.,
        God-originated list of right and wrong), there’s no transgression of that law either.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">By this method, righteousness comes out of faith, so that it would be dispensed
        in accordance to grace, resulting in the certainty of the promise to all the descendants of Abraham,
        not only to those who are based out of the Law of Moses but also to those who are based out of
        Abraham’s faith, who is the progenitor of us all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">just like it’s written in Scripture, “I have positioned you to be a father (i.e.,
        patriarch, progenitor) of every nation and of all Gentiles”…positioning him in plain sight of
        (and therefore getting the full attention of) the One whom he believed: God, the One who makes
        the dead alive and calls things which be not as being.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Contrary to hope but resting upon hope, Abraham believed, resulting in him becoming
        “a father of many nations” according to the quotation, “This is the way your offspring will be.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Not weakened in faith after fully noticing his own already-lifeless body, which
        by that time had existed for a hundred years or so, and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">he didn’t doubt the promise of God by being in unbelief but was strengthened
        in faith instead, after giving glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">convinced that He who promised is able also to do what He promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now what Scripture says—that righteousness was credited to him—was not written
        for his sake only,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but for our sake too, those to whom it’s going to be credited, namely to those
        believing and laying their trust upon the resurrected-Jesus—our Lord raised from the dead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">who was handed over and delivered to those who killed him by our sins and was
        raised by our justification (i.e., the process of getting us to where we are acquitted of our
        sins before God).</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Romans chapter 4 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So having been justified (i.e., examined by God the judge and declared to be
        righteous) as a result of faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through whom we’ve also arrived at the point where we have the access by faith
        to this grace in which we’ve come to stand and boast (i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in a hope
        of the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Not only that, but we also boast in our affliction, knowing that the affliction
        we experience accomplishes perseverance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">the ensuing perseverance approval (i.e., deemed sound as a result of having passed
        tests), the ensuing approval hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and the ensuing hope won’t disappoint, since the love of God has been poured
        out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You see, while we were still weak, even still at the appointed time Christ died
        on behalf of ungodly people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see, there’s hardly a person who will die on behalf of a person who’s righteous;
        and maybe someone will muster the courage to die on behalf of a good person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God’s own love is endorsed to us by virtue of the fact that Christ died on
        our behalf while we were still sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So now that we’ve been justified by his blood, we’ll all the more be spared from
        the wrath which is due us through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You see, if we were reconciled to God through the death of His son while we
        were enemies, now that we’ve been reconciled, we’ll all the more be spared, preserved, and kept
        intact by his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Not only that but we’ll also boast (i.e., take pride, bask, exult) in God through
        our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we at this time have received the previously stated reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Throughout this all, just as sin entered the world through one man and death
        (i.e., stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction) through the sin which entered,
        and in this way death propagated to all men, seeing that everybody has sinned—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">the fact is, up until law (i.e., an enumeration of God’s commandments) was given,
        sin was in the world (i.e., the established order of human beings), but sin is not transacted
        and counted against a person when law doesn’t exist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That aside, death reigned from Adam until Moses and it also reigned over those
        who didn’t sin by committing the same transgression that Adam committed, who is a prototype of
        and symbolic of all human beings who come after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But put that aside. The gift of grace doesn’t operate the same way as the initial
        transgression: for if the many died (i.e., were transformed into a state of spiritual death,
        resulting in their lives becoming a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction—culminating
        in physical death itself) by the single transgression, all the more did the grace of God and
        the unrequited-gift overflow to the many by grace, by the one man Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the unrequited-gift doesn’t operate the same way as the affair with the
        lone person who sinned: on the one hand the judicial review which came out of an incident involving
        a single person resulted in condemnation, but on the other hand the grace which came out of many
        transgressions resulted in an act of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Put another way, if by the transgression of the singular person death reigned
        through the singular person, all the more will they who receive the abundance of the grace of
        God and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the singular person Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So then, just as condemnation came to every person as the result of one transgression,
        in the same way one act of righteousness resulted in making available to every person the ability
        of to have the slate of his entire life wiped clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For just as through the disobedience of the singular person the many were declared
        by imposition to be sinners, in the same way too through the obedience of the singular person
        the many are declared by imposition to be righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But law (i.e., the expectation of living up to the standards imposed by a list
        of right and wrong) slipped in, sneaking in unplanned as though crashing a party, in order that
        the transgression seeded by Adam and propagated to the entire human race would multiply; but
        if the sin which was seeded multiplied, grace multiplied even more so,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">so that just as the sin which was seeded reigned by the death that it spawned,
        in the same way grace would reign through righteousness resulting in eternal life (i.e., that
        special fullness of life, one which begins in this lifetime) through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Romans chapter 5 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So what’s there to say about this? Shall we dwell in the sin inherent in all
        humans so that more and more grace will come of it?—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Don’t even think about it. We—the very people who died (i.e., were transformed
        into a state of spiritual death, resulting in our lives becoming a stagnation of waste, joylessness,
        futility, and destruction) in the sin inherited by all humans—how will we live in it still?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Or are you ignorant of the fact that any person at all who was baptized into
        Christ Jesus (i.e., was initiated into a total dedication to Christ Jesus) was baptized (i.e.
        was initiated) into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So we were buried together with him through the baptism ritual symbolic of a
        total dedication to Christ resulting in death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from
        the dead through the glory of the Father, we too in like fashion would go about in a brand-newness
        of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You see, if we’ve become united together in a way which replicates his death,
        then certainly we will also be a product of the resurrection,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">knowing this: that our old-self was jointly-crucified, so that the body of sin
        (i.e., the sinful propensity incumbent to our human nature) would be done away with, done away
        with in respect to us slaving in the sin inherited by all humans:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for he who’s died has been justified from (i.e., cleared of; absolved of) the
        sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now if we jointly-died with Christ, we believe that we’ll also jointly-live with
        him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing for a fact that, now that he’s been raised from the dead, Christ won’t
        die anymore: death no longer has control over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The fact is, what died died once and for all in the sin inherited by all humans;
        what lives lives in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In the same way we also consider ourselves to be, on the one hand, dead in the
        sin, but on the other hand living in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So don’t keep on letting sin reign in your mortal bodies (i.e., the part of
        you which hosts carnal desires during your life here on Earth) to where you obey its sinful desire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">nor put your body parts (i.e., your physical body parts, each part being a metonymy
        for various activities one engages in. In this case, each part is a metonymy for this or that
        sin, the whole comprising your personal carnal signature) in a place where they’re available
        to be used as tools, mechanisms, or weapons of unrighteousness in the sin inherent in all humans,
        but instead put yourselves in a place where you’re made available in God as alive from the dead
        and your body parts as tools, mechanisms, and weapons of righteousness in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To this point, sin will not control you; you see, you’re not under the jurisdiction
        of law (i.e., your life is decided by a list of do’s-and-dont’s) but under the jurisdiction of
        grace instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So now…shall we sin since we’re not under the jurisdiction of law but under
        the jurisdiction of grace instead?—Don’t even think about it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You ought to know that whatever thing you make yourself available to be used
        by—used to the point of being obedient to—you’re enslaved to, a slave of either sin culminating
        in death or obedience culminating in righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">God is so good: you were slaves of sin, but you whole-heartedly obeyed what
        was presented to you in a clear, orderly, and systematic way: the particular kind of instruction
        which has you walking in the righteousness of faith rather than just following a set of rules;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">having been freed from the sin inherent in all humans, you were enslaved by
        righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The subject I’m talking about is the human condition and human experience on
        account of the weakness of your flesh (i.e., of your lack of self-ability apart from God; of
        that part of you which has carnal desires; of that part of you which fails to live up to God’s
        standards). You see, just as you made your body parts available to be used as slaves in the filth
        and degradation of carnality and in an artifact of sin, namely the refusal to be restrained by
        any laws, rules, or codes of conduct, which leads to even more of the same, in like fashion make
        your body parts available at this time to be used as slaves by the righteousness which is a consequence
        of faith which leads to holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The fact is, when you were yet slaves of sin, you were free with respect to
        living in righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So what final result did you obtain back then, based on the things which you’re
        now ashamed of? The fact of the matter is that those things end in death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But as things stand now, on the one hand having been freed from the sin inherent

        life) on the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the wages of the sin inherent in all humans is death, but the gift of God

      <VERS vnumber="1">Or are you unaware, comrades (and I’m speaking to those of you who’re familiar
        with the operative details of a law-code), that the Law of Moses exercises control over a person
        only during that person’s lifetime?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To this point, a married woman (who owing to marriage laws is under the authority
        of her husband, who has the legal right to initiate a divorce—but not she) is legally bound to
        her husband while he’s alive. If the husband were to die, then-and-only-then will she be released
        from her legal constraint to her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then, while her husband’s still alive, she’d be officially labeled an adulteress
        if she were to get married (and therefore under the authority of and bound to) to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the same way, my fellow comrades, through the body of Christ you too have
        been put to death in relation to the Law of Moses resulting in you having come into being under
        the authority of and bound to another—to him who’s been raised from the dead—in order that you
        would produce aftereffects in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You see, when you were in the flesh (i.e., trying in and of yourself to live
        up to God’s rules while at the same time beholden to your carnal nature), the passions of the
        sins pervasive to mankind, those things that, on account of the Law, were repeatedly at work
        in our body parts (i.e., your personal carnal signature) resulting in the production of aftereffects
        in death (i.e., in a stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But as things stand now, we’ve been released from the Law of Moses, having died
        to that which kept holding us down, so that we serve in newness of spirit (i.e. walking in line
        with and dominated by a regenerated human spirit, which is in communion with the Holy Spirit)
        and not oldness of letter (i.e., a strict, literal, exacting interpretation of the verbatim Law
        of Moses, along with a grueling, rigid adherence done the “old way”—out of a person’s self-ability).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So what’s there to say about this? Are we to conclude that the Law of Moses is
        characteristic of and has the quality and nature of sin?—Don’t even think about it—on the contrary
        I would not have come to know, recognize, and understand the sin pervasive to mankind if not
        through law (i.e., by conducting my life under the weight of a long list of God-ordained rules);
        for indeed I would’ve come to know this first-hand had not the Law of Moses kept on telling me
        over and over, “Thou shalt not covet such-and-such.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Sin took advantage of the situation through the commandment “thou shalt not covet”
        and worked utterly in me every sort of coveting imaginable: you see, apart from law (i.e., being
        forced to obey a list of rules) sin is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the past I was alive and living apart from law; but the commandment came and
        the sin of coveting which I just mentioned sprang to life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I died. It became evident in me that the commandment—the same one leading to
        life—was leading to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To be more specific, the sin of coveting through the commandment took advantage
        of the situation, fooled me completely, and killed me (i.e., caused me to die spiritually) by
        this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Consequently, the Law of Moses is indeed holy, and the commandment “thou shalt
        not covet” is holy and just and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So the thing which is good became a mechanism of death in me, right?—Don’t even
        think about it; on the contrary, in order that the nature and devastation of sin would become
        apparent, sin utterly worked death through the good in me, so that the sin of coveting would
        reach its maximal efficacy through the commandment “thou shalt not covet.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You see, we know for a fact that the Law is intrinsically spiritual; I am fleshly
        (i.e., the nature of my physical body is that it is susceptible to carnal temptations, and that
        part of me does not want to serve God), having been sold by the sin pervasive to mankind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I don’t understand nor do I recognize what it is that I’m getting done; the
        fact of the matter is, I’m not putting into practice what I want—I’m doing what I hate instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if I’m doing what I don’t want to, I concur with the Law of Moses, concurring
        that it’s good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At this point, though, it’s no longer me personally accomplishing this but rather
        the sin which inhabits me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You see, I know for a fact that good does not inhabit me, that is, in my flesh
        (i.e. in my human, carnal nature); for the wanting is present in me, at hand ready to jump in,
        but getting the good done is not happening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In fact, I’m not doing the good that I want to do, but instead, I’m doing the
        bad which I don’t want to do and doing it on a day-to-day basis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if what I don’t want to do is the thing that I’m doing, It’s no longer me
        producing the finished product but the sin which inhabits me is producing it instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I’m discovering the Law of God (i.e., the principle that one should do right
        and live according to God’s will), then, with the wanting in me to do the good, because the bad
        is present in me, ready to rear its ugly head;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">you see, I delight in the Law of God with respect to the inner-person,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but I see another law (i.e., a different principle) in my body parts (i.e.,
        in my unique carnal signature) waging war against the law of my mind (i.e. against the principles
        by which my mind operate), defeating me and making me a prisoner of the sin which exists in my
        body parts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">What a miserable person I am: who’ll rescue me from this body which is rooted
        in death?—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">God is so good through Jesus Christ our Lord!—So then me—on the one hand I’m
        enslaved in mind to a law of God (i.e., to a principle set in place by God), but on the other
        hand I’m enslaved in flesh to a law of sin (i.e., to a principle of sin caused by carnality).</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore, there’s nothing of condemnation now with those in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The law of the spirit of life (i.e., the principle of living a spiritual life
        in communion with the Holy Spirit) set you free from the law of the sin which afflicts mankind
        and the ensuing death (i.e. the principle of sin coming about due to our human nature and the
        resulting stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility, and destruction).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You see, the inability of the Law of Moses in that it was continually weak through
        the flesh (i.e., through human ability alone apart from God and aggravated by human carnality),
        God sent His very-own son in sinful-flesh form and, in regard to sin, condemned the sin in the
        flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">so that the decrees of the Law of Moses would be fulfilled in us, in those who’re
        not going about their day-to-day business according to flesh (i.e., according to their own ability
        apart from God and according to their carnal nature) but rather according to spirit (i.e., according
        to a spiritual life, a life in communion with the Holy Spirit).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For those whose existence is in accordance with the nature of the flesh think
        about the things of the flesh; those whose existence is in accordance with spirit (i.e. with
        living a spiritual life) think about the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The fact of the matter is that the flesh-mindset is death; the mindset of the
        spirit is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, the mindset of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it doesn’t submit
        to the Law of God; in fact, it can’t do so:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Those existing in flesh can’t please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You aren’t in flesh (i.e., live out of your natural ability and through your
        carnal nature) but in spirit (i.e., live out of a regenerated human spirit in communion with
        the Holy Spirit), if God’s Spirit in fact dwells in you. (If a given person doesn’t have Christ’s
        Spirit, that person’s not a part of him and from him.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now if Christ is in you—yes—the body is dead through sin, but the spirit has
        life and is alive through righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you all, He
        who raised Jesus from the dead will also invigorate your mortal bodies through the Indwelling
        Spirit in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, comrades, we have an obligation—but not to the flesh—we’re not to live
        according to flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If you live according to flesh, you’re going to die (i.e., experience spiritual
        death), you see; but if by spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you’re going to
        live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The fact is, any people—any people at all—who’re led by the Spirit of God: these
        people are sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In fact, you have not received a spirit (i.e., a prevailing disposition) of
        slavery resulting in fear again; instead, you’ve received a spirit of adoption, one with which
        we cry out, “Papa! Father!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Spirit himself in conjunction with our spirit jointly declares that we are
        children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If children, heirs too—heirs of God indeed; joint-heirs of Christ’s inheritance,
        if indeed we jointly-suffer with him in order that we too would be jointly-glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Regarding this point, I figure that the present-day sufferings aren’t even in
        the same ballpark as the glory that’s going to be revealed to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In fact, the creation is in suspense waiting for the sons of God to break onto
        the scene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You see, the creation was subjected to futility—not willingly of course—no—it
        was subjected on account of whoever or whatever subjected it, resting upon hope</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that the creation itself will be set free from the slavery of corruption (a
        corruption like decomposing organic matter) over to the freedom of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Regarding this, we know from first-hand experience that every bit of the creation
        moans and groans in unison and is in agony in unison from the time it was first corrupted up
        to now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Not only does the creation moan, groan, and agonize but so do those who have
        a token sample of celebration of the Spirit—namely us—we too moan and groan within ourselves
        in suspense waiting for an adoption, the redemption of our body (i.e., the restoration of the
        body to its original purpose and function and the elimination of the carnal nature).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In fact, we were saved by hope; hope which is seen (i.e., is of something which
        verifiably exists in the physical world) isn’t hope—just who hopes for what he sees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now if we hope for what we don’t see, we’re in suspense awaiting it, exercising
        perseverance throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">In the same way, the Spirit helps us (i.e., he gets ahold of something in unison
        with us against that something) with our weakness: you see, we don’t know how we must pray or
        what we must pray; instead of us being constrained by that limitation, when he intercedes on
        behalf of others, the Spirit himself intercedes (i.e., he personally acts on another’s behalf
        by joining up with him in order to obtain a goal, to hit the mark like an arrow hitting its target,
        like a baseball player who gets a good solid hit on a ball putting it in the spot he’s chosen)
        with moans and groans which can’t be put into speech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The one who searches the hearts knows for a fact the thoughts, opinions, and
        intentions of the Spirit, since he intercedes on behalf of people set apart for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We know for a fact that God works all things in unison towards a good goal for
        them who love God, those who exist as the according-to-purpose called-ones,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">since they whom He foreknew (i.e., knew one’s individual personality, nature,
        and spiritual acuity before it became apparent), he foreordained to conform to the image of His
        son, resulting in him being firstborn among many comrades and brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Those whom He foreordained, He also called (i.e., summoned to believe in Him).
        And those He called, He also justified (i.e., declared “not guilty”); those He justified, He
        also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So what’s the takeaway?—If God’s on our side, who’s on the opposing team?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He who certainly didn’t spare His own son, but surrendered him to crucifixion
        on behalf of us all, how will He not freely and willingly give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who will press charges against those chosen by God, those in God’s church? God’s
        doing the justifying (i.e., God’s the one Who’s issuing the “not guilty” verdicts);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">who’s issuing the guilty verdicts? Is the person who’s issuing the guilty verdicts
        Christ Jesus, the fellow who died, but—beyond that—was resurrected? The fellow who’s also God’s
        chief executive, the fellow who also intercedes on our behalf?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">What will separate us from the love of Christ—tribulation…distress…persecution…famine…nakedness…danger…sword
        (i.e., another’s imposition of brute force upon you even to the threat of death)?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">In other words, the children of the flesh (i.e., the biological offsprings) are
        not the ones who’re the children of God, rather the children of promise are regarded as being

      <VERS vnumber="8">In fact, I’m saying that Christ has already become a minister of circumcision
        (i.e., a minister to those following the Law of Moses) on behalf of the truth of God arriving

      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>but became a servant

        You to do so</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>And another verse says: Rejoice, Gentiles, with His

      <VERS vnumber="13">Would that the God of hope fill you with every kind of joy and peace imaginable
        in the Faith to the point of you overflowing in the hope—in the power—of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Concerning you, I’ve been convinced, my dear fellow comrades—even I personally
        have been—that you—yes, you—are full of goodness, having reached a point where you’re filled

      <VERS vnumber="15">But occasionally I didn’t hold back any punches when I wrote to you, as I would
        remind you through the God-given grace that was given to me</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, treating my ministry
        of the good news, the Gospel, of God as a holy, priestly duty, in order that the sacrificial
        offering so to speak of the Gentiles would become something acceptable, being made holy by the
        Holy Spirit.</VERS>

        power of the Spirit of God, so much so that the fulfillment of the spreading of the good news
        of Christ took me from Jerusalem and its surrounding area all the way to Illyricum,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">But I’m going to Jerusalem now in my serving the saints, our fellow-believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The fact of the matter is that Macedonia and Achaia have been enthusiastic about
        making a tangible contribution to the saints in Jerusalem who are poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">They have been enthusiastic, you see, and are indebted to them: for if the believers
        in Jerusalem made tangible contributions to the Gentiles by means of their Holy Spirit-generated
        gifts, ministries, and manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the Gentiles too ought to serve them
        in the form of offerings made by means of their own physical abilities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So now that I’m finished with this offering, signed, sealed, and delivered,
        I’ll depart and cross through your area on my way to Spain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know for a fact that I’m headed your way, going in the fullness of the blessings
        of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">I beseech you, comrades, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love
        of the Spirit, for you to come together and help me out in your prayers to God for me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so that I’d be protected from and delivered out of the disobedience and incredulity
        pervasive among the Judeans, and that my ministry inside of Jerusalem would be accepted by the
        saints there,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">From Paul, who has the calling of an apostle (a missionary) of Christ Jesus through
        the will of God, and his comrade Sosthenes—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To God’s church which exists in Corinth, those set apart by Christ Jesus from
        the unbelievers in this world, those called to be holy in unison with those everywhere who are
        calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (i.e., those invoking Jesus’s promises, his authority,
        and his favorable disposition)—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When it comes to you, I’m always thanking my God for the grace He’s given you
        in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">because in him you’ve been enriched in all things, in every concept imaginable
        and in all sorts of knowledge and understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">just as the testimony of Christ (i.e., the official statement about Christ) has
        been both made firm and has been confirmed in you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that you’re not lacking in any Holy Spirit-generated gift, ministry, or manifestation
        of the Holy Spirit, eagerly awaiting the revelation of Christ Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">who will also establish us until the end of time so that we’re blameless in the
        day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Faithful is the God through whom we’ve been called into the fellowship of His
        son Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I appeal to you, comrades, through the name (i.e., the authority) of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, pleading to you that you would always be on the same page and that there not be
        divisions among you, but that you’d be fitted and mended together with the same mind and with
        the same knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In this regard and concerning you, it’s been made clear to me by Chloe’s family
        and her servants, my dear comrades, that there’s strife going on between you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I’ll say this: some of you say “I’m Paul’s devotee exclusively” while others
        say “I’m Apollos’s devotee exclusively” or “I’m Peter’s devotee exclusively”, or “I’m Christ’s
        devotee exclusively.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Has Christ been divided up into pieces? Paul wasn’t crucified on your behalf,
        was he? Or, were you baptized (i.e., initiated into the Christian faith) on Paul’s sole authority
        to be a member of Paul’s camp?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Thank God I didn’t baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">lest anyone say that they were baptized on my sole authority to be a member
        of my camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now I did baptize Stephanas’s family and servants, but as far as the rest of
        you, I’m not absolutely sure if I baptized anyone else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You see, Christ didn’t send me to go about baptizing in order to build a camp
        of my own followers but to go about evangelizing instead, not in wisdom which comes out of a
        message, so that the cross of Christ wouldn’t be rendered ineffectual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The message of the cross, you see, is stupidity to those who are lost and dying
        on the one hand, but to those who are being saved (i.e., being rescued from spiritual, moral,
        and physical calamity), it’s the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>For it’s written in the Old Testament:
        I’ll destroy the wisdom of the wise,And I’ll annul the understanding of those who understand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where’s the wise man? Where’s the scholar? Where’s this generation’s premier
        debater? Hasn’t God turned this world’s wisdom into stupidity?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You see, by the wisdom of God, since the world through its wisdom didn’t come
        to recognize, discern, understand, or know God, God was more than happy through the stupidity
        of what was preached to save those who made the decision to believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Forasmuch as Jews chase after stupendous miracles and Westerners chase after
        wisdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">we, on the other hand, preach a crucified-Christ; for Jews it’s the root-cause
        of the failure caused by disobedience on the one end of the stick, on the other end of the stick,
        for Westerners it’s stupidity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but to them who are “the Called” (i.e., those whom God has summoned to be His
        people and who have heeded the summons), Jews and Westerners alike, Christ is God’s power and
        God’s wisdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">since the “stupidity” of God is wiser than the wisdom to be found in mankind,
        and the “weakness” of God is stronger than the strength to be found in mankind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">To this point, consider your group “the Called”: if one looks at their backgrounds
        only, not very many of them are wise, not many powerful, not many from high-society families
        or nobility.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">No, God’s chosen the stupid things of the world to put to shame the wise things,
        and the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and God’s chosen the lowly born and those things which are contemptuous—He’s
        chosen the things that don’t exist to abolish what does,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">so that any and every human endeavor or accomplishment apart from God can’t
        be presented proudly before Him in the statement, “See—look what I did!”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what’s come out of Him is that you’re melded with Christ Jesus, who became
        to us wisdom from God, righteousness, and likewise holiness and redemption (i.e., the recovery
        of what you once had),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so it’d turn out just like it’s written in the Old Testament, “Let the one who
        brags about his accomplishments brag in the Lord.”</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 1 Corinthians chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When I went and visited you, comrades, I didn’t go there and use heady, intellectual
        language and sublime speech while telling you about the mystery of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You see, I decided that when among you I’d appear as though I knew no other facts
        whatsoever except things about Jesus Christ and the fact that this fellow was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I appeared to you as one lacking vigor and strength and as downright fearful,
        and was frequently trembling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and my message and my preaching weren’t in words that were wise and persuasive
        but were accompanied by a powerful demonstration of the Spirit that’s difficult to describe if
        you’ve never experienced it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that your faith wouldn’t be a faith grounded in human wisdom but would be
        in the power of God instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now we speak words of wisdom among those who are mature, a wisdom, however, not
        of this age nor of the rulers of this age (i.e., the demon spirits which have controlling influence
        over this world), rulers who are being rendered ineffective and brought to nothing—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">instead we speak words of God’s wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom which has been
        hidden up to this point, a wisdom which God knew beforehand in eternity past and intended for
        our glory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">a wisdom which none of the rulers of this age knew, understood, or recognized,
        for if they had, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of Glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>No, the wisdom isn’t
        like that, it’s like it’s written instead: That which eye hasn’t seen and ear hasn’t heardAnd
        hasn’t arisen and come to rest upon any human heart—That which God prepared for those who love
        Him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">God revealed it to us through the Spirit: for the Spirit thoroughly searches
        and investigates everything, even the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For what person knows firsthand the intimate details and intentions of a given
        person except for that person’s spirit that’s in him? In the same way, no one has known, understood,
        or recognized the intimate details and intentions of God except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now we have not received the spirit of the world but rather the Spirit who proceeds
        out of God, so that we would know firsthand what God has given to us as an expression of His
        grace—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and what was given to us is also that which we speak, not speaking in human
        teachings consisting of words of wisdom but rather in teachings of the Spirit consisting of the
        fitting together nicely of Holy Spirit-related content with other Holy Spirit-related content.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A person who’s dominated by his mind, intellect, or emotions instead of by his
        spirit won’t receive the things of the Spirit of God; in fact, to him such things are stupid,
        and he cannot know, understand, or recognize them because such things are spiritually examined
        and decided as a result.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the spiritual person examines and decides all things, but he himself isn’t
        examined and his life decided by anyone.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But I, comrades, wasn’t able to speak to you like I would to people attuned to
        and dominated by spiritual things but rather like I would to people attuned to and dominated
        by fleshly things (i.e., things that have to do with our lives in the natural, even touching
        our carnal appetites), same as I would to those who are babies in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I fed you milk, not solid food, as you were not yet able to digest solid food,
        having not been weaned off milk—but even now you still can’t handle solid food;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You’re still fleshly, you see: where there’s jealousy and strife still found
        among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not leads lives dictated by the undesirable human
        tendencies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For example, when one of you says, “I’m Paul’s devotee exclusively,” and another
        of you says, “I’m Apollos’s devotee exclusively,” are you not being dominated by your undesirable
        human tendencies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So who is Apollos? Who is Paul—they’re ministers, and you came to believe in
        Christ through their ministries, and all the steps involved and the ministries that were a part
        of leading you to Christ happened to each person as the Lord granted that it happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that neither the one doing the planting nor the one doing the watering is
        the most important part of the process, but God who makes things grow is the most important.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The one who does the planting and the one who does the watering are on the same
        team, and each will receive an individual-specific wage according to his own individual labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We’re God’s coworkers, you see, laboring together in God’s field, whereas you’re
        the building-project which God’s constructing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">being constructed according to the grace of God which was given to me as a judicious
        chief architect and principal contractor. Accordingly, I laid the foundation, and another subcontractor
        came after me and built the structure on top of the foundation, but let each subcontractor look
        over what he built, to ensure that it was done correctly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The fact of the matter is that no one can lay any other foundation other than
        the one which has been laid, which foundation is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if some subcontractor builds upon the foundation by putting in place gold,
        silver, gemstones (i.e., the subcontractor did a high-quality job), wood, hay, or straw (i.e.,
        the subcontractor did a low-quality job) structures upon that foundation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">the quality of the work that that particular subcontractor did will become apparent
        to everyone, since some cataclysmic event will eventually occur that is enormously stressful
        to the structure, making its true strengths and deficiencies abundantly clear to everyone, since
        these true strengths and weaknesses are revealed by fire (i.e., intense stress), and the fire
        will determine what kind of job was done by putting it through the wringer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If any of the built-up construction remains, the subcontractor will get paid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">if any of the built-up construction is burned up, he’ll lose money on the project,
        but he’ll be spared of personal ruin, but he’ll lose his entire investment through the ordeal.</VERS>

        up residence in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If someone trashes, ruins, or destroys the temple of God, God will trash that

        become overly-inflated, with one person thinking himself to be superior in understanding something

      <VERS vnumber="26">These are my thoughts about living through the difficulties of the present time,

        from a wife?—Don’t go looking for another woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But if you do happen to get married, you haven’t sinned. And if the typical
        young lady in the church happens to get married, she hasn’t sinned. Folks such as these will
        face hard times in their natural lives; I’m trying to spare you this grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Let me tell you what, comrades, a compressed window of time is all that remains
        of our lives, so that those who have wives should live as though they don’t have wives,</VERS>

        they don’t rejoice, and those who deal in business as though they’ve halted trading,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those using the world as though they don’t use it; when you get right down
        to it, the world we live in in its present form is passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I don’t want you to be consumed by or worry about the trivial day-to-day affairs
        of life. He who’s not married is consumed by and worries about the things of the Lord, how he
        might be pleasing to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">but he who’s married is consumed by and worries about things of the world we
        live in and the people we live around, how he might use these things to be pleasing to the wife
        he has,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and he reaches the point where he’s constantly consumed by these and worries
        about them continually. Both the woman who’s single and the young lady who’s never been married
        are consumed by and worry about the things of the Lord, so they would be holy both in body and
        in spirit. But she who’s married is consumed by and worries about the things of the world, how
        she’s going to please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I’m telling you this for your own benefit—not so I can put you on a leash, but
        so it would result in a seemly, undistracted devotion to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Now if someone’s behaving inappropriately towards the young lady he’s in a relationship
        with, and he thinks she might be “overly-ripe” in such a way that he’s obliged to make something
        happen (i.e., she’s pregnant, he thinks it might be too hard to hide anymore, and he’ll have
        to do something about it), let him do what he wants to do—he’s not committing a sin in doing
        so—let them get married.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he who has taken a firm stand in his heart, not having to act out of necessity
        but has the upper-hand over his individual sexual desire, and has decided in his own heart to
        stay a virgin rather than sleep with his girlfriend or fiancée, does well,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">with the result that both he who waits until marriage handles his virginity
        well, but he who remains single will do better, as he’ll be spared the difficulties I wrote about
        here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The wife is morally bound to her husband as long as her husband lives, but if
        her husband were to pass away, she’s free to marry whom she wants, only she must marry in the
        Lord (i.e., marry in such a way that’s pleasing to the Lord; marry another believer).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But in my opinion she’d be happier if she were to stay the way she is (i.e.,
        stay unmarried after becoming a widow), and I think I have the agreement of the Spirit of God
        too.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about the issue of eating meat sacrificed to idols, every one of us has our

      <VERS vnumber="7">That aside, we are not on the same level in every aspect of understanding. Up

      <VERS vnumber="7">In regard to this topic, a man certainly doesn’t have to put a veil over his

        (i.e., man’s pride and joy; what he treasures above all else; the reflection of the finest in
        him; his complement).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You see, man isn’t derived from woman, but the other way around: woman is derived

        and applied to your own selves), and in which you stand (i.e., in this you are established, you

        heedlessly, inconsiderately, without purpose, without just cause, without careful thought, without
        due consideration, or haphazardly made the decision).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You see, I gave the highest priority to putting into you what I too received,

      <VERS vnumber="4">that he was buried, that he rose on the Third Day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that he was seen by Peter, and then after that by the twelve disciples.</VERS>

        of whom have stayed alive until now, but some of them have passed away.</VERS>

        a relationship with God; where God works in and through your life); neither does decayable mortality
        tainted with moral corruption inherit non-decayable immortality untainted by moral corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Hey—I’ll tell you a mystery: we all shall not sleep (i.e., stay dead forever),
        but we all shall be changed</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a split-second, in the time it takes to blink an eye, at the last bugle call:
        the bugle shall sound off, and the dead will be raised and become non-decayable immortals untainted
        by moral corruption. Yes, we ourselves shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">You see, this decayable mortality must put on non-decayable immortality, and
        this mortal nature must put on an immortal nature.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1"><BR art="x-nl"/>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and his fellow
        comrade Timothy— To the church of God that is in Corinth, joined by the saints (i.e., God’s people)
        who are all over Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Give praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Originator of
        all sorts of compassion and of advice, encouragement, and consolation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">which consoles, etc. us in all of our distresses, resulting in our ability to
        console those in all kinds of distresses with the same consolation with which we’re being consoled
        by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Just as Christ’s sufferings proliferate to us, in the same way through Christ
        the consolation we receive proliferates as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whether we’re being pressured, it’s for the sake of your consolation and salvation
        (i.e., your being rescued from spiritual, moral, mental, and physical calamity); whether we’re
        being consoled, it’s for the sake of your consolation, a consolation which is accomplished by
        enduring the same sufferings which we too suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the hope which we have for you—our hope is firm, fixed in the observation
        that as you are joint participants of the sufferings which we suffer, in the same way you are
        joint participants of the consolation as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In this regard, we don’t want you to be left in the dark, comrades, about the
        extreme difficulties we experienced in the Roman province of Asia, that we were overloaded and
        overwhelmed to the point that we lost the will to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Anyways, deep inside ourselves we concluded that we were doomed to die, so we
        reached the point where we couldn’t be convinced that our own abilities would save us, but were
        convinced that the God who raises the dead would do so instead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He Who rescued us from a narrow brush with death—and rescues us continuously—we
        set our hope in Him that He’ll rescue us yet again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">while you too were joining in lending a helping hand by the prayers that you
        prayed for us, so that the outcome of the stances, disposition, and full attention of many people
        is that the mercy and kindness shown to us would be thanked by many on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You see, our proud talk and bold claims are on par with the solemn declaration
        of our conscience, since the lifestyle we led in the world (i.e., among those who aren’t believers)
        was by God’s simplicity and sincerity, not by the wisdom of flesh (i.e., by the cunning shrewdness
        of our own ability apart from God tainted by the carnal nature) but by God’s grace instead—and
        that lifestyle was all the more so with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In fact we’re writing to you nothing other than what you’re reading to the congregation
        or what you’re coming to understand, but I hope that you continue to gain an exact understanding
        until it’s all said and done,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">just as you also gained an understanding of us, at least partially, that we
        are the reason for your proud talk and bold claims just as you too will be ours in the Day of
        the Lord Jesus (i.e., when he’s revealed in the fullness of his might).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We formed a long-term desire for this, for what we’ve reached the point where
        we’re convinced is the thing that we want to do more than anything else, namely to go visit you,
        so that you would get a second grace (i.e., a second impartation of our face-to-face ministry),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and to continue on our journey through your city to Macedonia, to resume the
        journey going from Macedonia back to your city again, and to be sent forth by you (i.e., depart
        fully rested, provisioned, and in good spirits—all on account of the your generosity and hospitality)
        to the Jews in Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then, was this plan treated with a nonchalant thought-process? Or what I’m
        planning, I’m planning according to flesh (i.e., from my own self apart from God, according to
        my own needs, and somewhat tainted to feed my carnal appetite), so that it would be “the yes-yes
        and the no-no” with me (i.e., I’d vacillate or renege on what I planned or promised to do)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But—by God—trust me that the statements we made to you aren’t “the yes-yes and
        the no-no.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">To this point, God’s son Jesus Christ, who through us has been preached among
        you—through me, Siloam, and Timothy—hasn’t wound up being “the yes-yes and the no-no,” but rather
        has wound up being “yes” in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For as many promises as there are from God, in him they are all “yes” (i.e.,
        no vacillating or reneging on them), and in light of this through him is also the Amen (i.e.,
        the acknowledgement of the finality of a matter; the familiar profession to God of “Let it be
        so”) to God with glory through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">God’s establishing us together with you in Christ and anointed us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He also stamped us with His seal of approval and gave us the down payment of
        the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I swear to God—cross my heart and hope to die—that it was to spare you that
        I no longer went to Corinth—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">not that we act in a domineering manner towards you of the Faith—no—we work
        together as helpers of your grace: for you have stood by faith.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 2 Corinthians chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Getting to the point, I made up my mind that I wouldn’t visit you again while
        laden with the pains of sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In fact, if I’m making you feel sorry, who in particular will cheer me up apart
        from the one I made feel sorry?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The very thing I wrote, I wrote so that I wouldn’t come for a visit and wind
        up being made sorry by the ones I ought to rejoice over, as my nearness to you all has convinced
        me that my joy is derived from you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In fact, what I wrote to you through many tears came out of a great deal of distress
        and heart-felt anguish, not so that it would cause you sorrow, but so that you’d understand the
        abundant love which I have for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If a certain person has caused sorrow, he hasn’t caused me sorrow (actually no,
        he has partially), so I won’t dump any more of this on you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The very punishment inflicted by the many is enough for such a person,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that on the flip-side, you should be all the more kind and merciful to him
        and comfort and encourage him, so that such a person not somehow be deluged with even more sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In light of this I advise you to broadcast love to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In fact, another reason I wrote is so that I could discern if you live up to
        my standards, that is if you obey everything you’re told.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now if you forgive somebody of something, so do I; you see, if in addition to
        you I forgave somebody of something, what I’ve forgiven (assuming there’s something I’m forgiving),
        I did so through you under the scrutiny of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">so that we won’t be swindled by Satan: we are not ignorant of his intentions,
        you see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now that I’ve arrived at Troas for the purpose of spreading the Gospel of Christ
        (i.e., the good news about Christ), a door has been opened to me in the Lord (i.e., in regard
        to the things of the Lord, a tremendous opportunity has presented itself to me),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I was uncomfortable in my spirit not finding my fellow-comrade Titus, so instead
        I excused myself, said goodbye to them, and left for Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But thank-you God, Who always makes us roadies on Christ’s victory tour, and
        Who’s propagating the fragrance of his knowledge through us in all regions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">since in God we are a pleasant aroma (like the incense they burned in the Old
        Testament, or the pleasing smell of a burnt offering) of Christ among those being saved (i.e.,
        those being rescued from calamity) and among those perishing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">we who on the one hand are a whiff of going from death to even more death, and
        on the other hand are a whiff of going from life to even more life—and that’s not good enough
        for some people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You see, we’re not like so many other preachers who hustle the word of God—no—we
        preach the Gospel like it’s coming from someone who’s sincere through-and-through—no—we speak
        the word of God in Christ like it’s coming directly from God while we stand before God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 2 Corinthians chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Are my comrades and I starting over again in doing self-promotion to bolster
        your opinion of us? Put another way, we’re not in need of letters of recommendation to be sent
        to you or to be received from you, like some people do, are we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are our letter of recommendation, written in our hearts, understood and read
        by all people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It’s plain for all to see that you are a letter of Christ transcribed and delivered
        by us; not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not written in stone but
        written in a flesh-heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We’re convinced that we have such a thing through Christ with God—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not that we’re up-to-par in and of ourselves to where we figure that something
        in particular which is good was self-generated, but rather that our adequacy comes out of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who also made us up-to-par ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter (i.e.,
        the literal, exacting listing of rules, compliance with those rules, and consequences for breaking
        them) but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, but the Spirit causes things to spring into life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now if the administering of death, which was packaged in letters etched in stone,
        occurred in glory to the point that it wasn’t possible for the run-of-the-mill Israelite to gaze
        at Moses’s face because of the glory of his face—a glory that was deteriorating no less—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how much more will the administering of the Spirit be accompanied by glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore, if there was glory in the administering of condemnation, how much
        more does the administering of righteousness exceed it in glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And furthermore, that which has been made glorious hasn’t been made glorious
        relative to the glory which surpasses it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In fact, if the glory which has been nullified has been nullified by glory,
        the glory which remains does so all the more in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So having such hope, in our outspokenness and boldness we conceal nothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">unlike Moses who placed a veil over his face so that the run-of-the-mill Israelites
        couldn’t gaze at the vestige of the glory that was deteriorating—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">not a chance—their minds were dead-set against it. In fact to this very day
        the same veil remains uncovered at the reading of the Old Testament, since it’s done away with
        in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">No—to this day whenever the Old Testament happens to be read aloud a veil lies
        over their heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">but, if they were to turn to the Lord, the moment they do so, the veil gets
        taken off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is in lockstep with the Spirit, and there’s freedom where the Spirit
        of the Lord is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While gazing at the glory of the Lord with an uncovered face as though we’re
        looking intently in a mirror, we all are transformed into the same image going from one gaze
        of glory to another gaze of even more glory, just as we go from one gaze of the Spirit of the
        Lord to another gaze of even more of the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On account of this, that is of having this administering of righteousness, to
        the degree that we’ve been shown mercy, we don’t lose heart—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">on the contrary, we quit for good doing those things that we’re ashamed of that
        we keep hidden, not going here and there playing games with people, nor putting a spin on the
        word of God, rather by means of the propagation of the truth we leave a good impression deep
        inside of everyone else while under God’s scrutiny.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But even if our Gospel, our Good News Message, is veiled, it’s veiled among those
        who are perishing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">among whom the god of this age (i.e., this current era of mankind’s history)
        blinded the minds of those who refuse to believe to where they don’t see the light of the Gospel
        of the glory of Christ, who is a spitting image of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You see, we don’t preach that we ourselves are your superiors but rather that
        Jesus Christ is Lord, and that we ourselves are your humble servants on account of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">since the God Who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One Who shined
        in our hearts with the light of the knowledge and understanding of the glory of God by means
        of the direct attention of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have this treasure in clay storage vessels (i.e., physical bodies) so that
        the over-and-above power would be of God and not from ourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We’re pressured from every direction and in trouble, but no—we’re not at the
        end of our rope; confused as to what to do—but not totally confused;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">persecuted but not abandoned; knocked off our feet but not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus
        would also be manifested in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You see, we the living are forever being forced into a position where death
        has control over us because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus would also be manifested in our
        mortal body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then, the death I just described is at work in us, but the life I likewise
        described is at work in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Having a spirit of (i.e., a prevailing attitude of) faith that’s the same as
        what’s written in the Old Testament, “I believed, and in light of it all I spoke,” we too believe,
        and in light of it all we too speak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing for a fact that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us together
        with Jesus and together with him cast us in a favorable light in God’s estimation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You see, all these things are for your sake, so that the grace bestowed on us,
        having proliferated through the thanksgiving of the many, would abound to God’s glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">In light of this we’re not losing heart; on the contrary, even though our outer-person
        is deteriorating, yet our inner-person is being renewed day-in, day-out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">To this point, the light weight of our affliction is incomparable to the heavy
        weight of glory at work in us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we’re not looking at the things which are seen but the things that are
        not seen: for the things which are seen are transient, but the things which are not seen are
        eternal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In fact, we know for certain that if our Earth-suit were to be demolished, we
        have a building from God—an eternal building, one that’s not of human construction—way up in
        the sky.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In connection to this we do groan, longing to put on (i.e., as though putting
        on a piece of clothing) our home—our cozy cottage—which comes from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If we really have put on our eternal building, we won’t be caught naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Furthermore, we whose present form of existence is with the Earth-suit do groan,
        being encumbered, the crux of which is that we don’t want to be stripped of our garments but
        to be clothed instead, so that the death we carry about would be thoroughly dowsed by the life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now He Who did the necessary work in us to make this very thing happen to us

        they were good or bad—all of them—would be brought before the Judge to be judged by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now that we’ve acquired a firm understanding of the fear of the Lord, we convince
        other people to do the same. We’ve been made manifest to God (i.e., we’ve presented ourselves
        before God), and I hope to reach the point where we’ve been made manifest to your consciences
        as well—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Not that we’re trying to promote ourselves again, but are giving you the chance
        to talk proudly about us instead, so that you would have something good to say to those who take
        pride in and talk big about peoples’ behavior on the surface, or the masks people present to
        others, and not what’s in the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The fact of the matter is that if it’s the case that I’ve lost my mind, I’ve
        lost my mind for God; if it’s the case that I’m sane, I’m sane for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The love of Christ has a tight grip on us, you see, and has determined that
        this is the case: that one person died in everyone’s place (therefore everyone died),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he died in everyone’s place so that the living would no longer live for
        themselves but that they would instead live for him who died and was raised in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">An outcome of all this is that, from now on, there’s nobody we form a perception
        of according to the flesh (i.e., according to a person’s physical body and outward appearance;
        his limited ability in and of himself), even if we had come to know and understand Christ according
        to the flesh—but, no, we no longer know and understand him according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">An outcome of all this is that if someone is in Christ (melded with him: in
        him, with him, and living life by means of him), he’s a new type of species, a new kind of creature,
        a new creation: the old has come and gone and—get this—the new has come into being.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now all these new things are from God, Who by Christ reconciled us with Himself
        and gave us the Reconciliation Ministry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">that is that God was in Christ reconciling the world (i.e., those who don’t
        know and live for God) to Himself, not holding all the times they crossed over the line in doing
        wrong as strikes against them, and assigning to us the task of keeping and spreading the message
        of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So we’re ambassadors of Christ as we’re encouraging, exhorting, and advising
        others in matters pertaining to God. And this is the message we tell them: “As a representative
        of Christ I ask you—I beg you—to be reconciled to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He who had never consummated sin was made sin on our behalf so that we would
        become righteous of a nature of God’s righteousness in him (melded with him: in him, with him,
        and living life by means of him).”</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">I’m glad now, not because you were simply hurt, but rather that the pain that
        you suffered resulted in a change of heart and of actions. In fact, you were hurt God’s way,

      <VERS vnumber="10">You see, being hurt (hurt intentionally in a way that you suffer pain) God’s
        way effects a change of heart and actions working towards the end goal of dodging a bullet and
        having no regrets about what had to be done to accomplish that; the pain that the world (i.e.,
        those outside of Christ) experiences works in a way that, when it’s run its course, results in

      <VERS vnumber="1">Just wanted you to know, comrades, about the grace of God that’s been granted
        to the churches in Macedonia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in such a severe trial brought on by distress, the abundance of their joy
        and the vast extent of their poverty amplified the richness of their generosity—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">that according to their means—I swear—even beyond their means—and of their own
        free accord—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">with a good deal of explanations, assurances, and exhortation they were asking
        us to do them a favor and allow them to participate in ministering to the saints (i.e., their
        fellow believers).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they didn’t just do this the way we expected they would—no—by the will of
        God they first dedicated themselves to the Lord and to us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">resulting in us having encouraged Titus to finish off this favor, which is being
        done for you in a consistent manner to how he started it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">That aside, just as you continuously take everything to a new level—faith, attestation,
        knowledge and understanding, eager diligence, and the love which came out of us and was imparted
        in you—apply the same principles so that you would take this act of charity to the next level
        as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">What I’m saying shouldn’t be construed as an order, but certainly as a test of
        the authenticity of your love by the zeal which motivates others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In fact you know the act of charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he, being
        rich, became poor for your sake so that by that impoverishment you would become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I’ll give you my opinion on this topic: this benefits you, you the very ones
        who, beginning last year and continuing thenceforth, didn’t just begin to tackle this but maintained
        the desire to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now complete the doing-part as well, so that just as the enthusiasm of the
        wanting-part was prevalent from the inception, so the completion of the deed from the what-do-we-possess-part
        is the natural consequence of the wanting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if the enthusiasm’s in place, whatever gift a given person comes up with
        is acceptable according to whatever wealth and belongings that person happens to possess, not
        according to what he doesn’t possess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, this isn’t so that others can take it easy while you’re subjected to
        hardship, but it’s done out of equality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The way things stand at the moment, your abundance of material possessions is
        directed towards their lack so that equality would take shape,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>just as it’s written, He who has much
        didn’t have a surplusAnd he who has a little didn’t lack</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But God is so kind: for our sake He’s putting the same eagerness to get the
        job done in Titus’s heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">since, while—yes—he took the counsel, advise, and encouragement that was given
        to him to heart, but, being more eager than ever, of his own volition he left on a trip to visit
        you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">We sent someone to go with him, the comrade who’s praised throughout all the
        churches in his preaching of the Gospel—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">not just to go along for the ride but to be our travelling companion as well,
        hand-picked to be the churches’ attaché with respect to this act of charity, which is the service
        done by us to the glory of the Lord and which is a token of our enthusiasm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The intention is that no one would find fault with us in our handling of this
        generous gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In fact, we considered ahead of time what the decent thing to do would be, not
        just from the Lord’s perspective but also from the perspective of the average person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We sent our comrade along with the others, he who at many times and in many
        ways has proven to be eager, diligent, and to get things done without dragging his feet, but
        now is even more eager because of the tremendous confidence he has in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whether I’m speaking on behalf of Titus, my fellow worker and a mentor and assistant
        for you, or whether I’m speaking on behalf of our comrades the apostles of churches (i.e., those
        who are pioneers in founding churches; missionaries who establish churches), in either case the
        glory goes to Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the pointed demonstration of your love and of the tremendous things we tell
        them about you is taking place in full view of the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 2 Corinthians chapter 8 -->

      <VERS vnumber="1">As a matter of fact, I sure do have more to write to you concerning this ministry-drive
        for the saints (i.e., our fellow believers).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You see, having observed you, I know your enthusiasm, an enthusiasm I speak proudly
        about to the Macedonians, namely that Achaia started making preparations a year ago and that
        your passion for this project motivated a great many peoplethere.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I dispatched the comrades so that the tremendous things we say about you regarding
        this matter would not be for nothing, so that it would be just like I kept saying over and over
        again that you were making preparations—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but it’s not as though the Macedonians and I were going to somehow get together
        and go and catch you unprepared and we—dare I say you too—would be embarrassed at what’s behind
        it all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Anyways, to give the comrades encouragement was the most important thing to do,
        so that they would arrive in your locale ahead of time and put in order your pledged blessing
        (i.e., charitable contribution) ahead of time. These arrangements are thus so that the entire
        affair is done the way a blessing is done and not the way a shakedown for money is done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now onto this: he who sows parsimoniously also reaps parsimoniously and he who
        sows with a mindset of blessing others also reaps a blessing because of that mindset.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Let the offering from each person be according to what he decided in his heart
        beforehand, not out of an inner pain of regret in having to part with one’s money or out of compulsion,
        for God loves a cheerful, glad, happy, prompt-to-do giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In fact God is able to proliferate all kinds of grace (i.e., good things, in
        terms of money and material goods) to us, so that in all situations always having enough of everything
        you would exude any and every good work,</VERS>

        provide and multiply your seed and will cause the crop of your righteous endeavor to grow,</VERS>

        a heart which has the single, simple motive of giving, and therefore has no ulterior motive,
        attaches no strings, and gives without any of the complications of guilt, remorse, etc.; does
        so under no threat, no compulsion, nor because of any rule, religious or otherwise), which through
        us works God’s praise to the nth degree,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">because the ministry which consists of this religious ritual, this act of worship,
        this service to God, is not simply the supplying of the saints’ needs but also the causing of
        a multiplication-effect through much praise to God—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Through the proof of this ministry, God has been glorified in the compliance

        you personally—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but with the infusion of audacity which comes from not being present—I ask with

        live day in, day out according to the flesh (i.e. of our own ability apart from God; as though
        God doesn’t work through us).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You see, though living day in, day out in flesh (i.e., in a physical body, one
        subject to human weaknesses), we don’t wage war according to the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">our battle-gear isn’t fleshly (i.e., of a physical nature; of our own ability

        we also are derived from Christ in the same way as he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So now, if I venture to say something even more cocky about our authority (an
        authority which the Lord gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, by the way),
        I won’t embarrass myself and have to eat my words because I’ve failed in this regard,</VERS>

        straightforward, without conniving, ulterior motives, hidden agendas, or religious quid-pro-quo)
        and the purity which has Christ as its goal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For indeed, if a passerby stops over and preaches that another person is the
        real Jesus, a person whom we didn’t preach as being the real Jesus, or you receive (i.e., take
        to heart and wholeheartedly embrace) a different spirit which you didn’t receive before, or you
        wholeheartedly embrace a different good-news-type message that you didn’t receive, you tolerate
        it with no qualms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You see, the way I figure, we’re not inferior to these so-called super-apostles
        in any category.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But even if I’m an amateur when it comes to speaking ability and rhetoric, put
        that aside—I’m not an amateur when it comes to knowledge and understanding—no—I’ve made that

      <VERS vnumber="7">Is it that I committed a sin in humbling and debasing myself so that you would
        be made to stand on two legs, since I evangelized the good news of the Gospel to you sacrificially
        on my part and delivered it to you free of charge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Scratch that—I robbed other churches by drawing a wage from them and applying
        it to your ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not only that, when I was staying with you and was in need, I wasn’t a burden
        to anyone: the comrades who came from Macedonia provided what I needed. My living expenses weren’t
        a burden in any way to you, nor will they be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Christ in me unequivocally indicates that this is true: I won’t be denied the
        opportunity to speak with pride about what we will accomplish in the Lord in the region of Achaia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why would I be denied? Because I don’t love you? God knows for a fact that I
        do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">What I’m doing I’ll continue to do in order to nix the occasion for fault-finding

        boasting of, everyone will come to the conclusion that they’re also like us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In fact, false apostles such as they, workers of deceit, are disguising themselves
        as apostles of Christ—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it’s not surprising: Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So there’s not a huge difference if his servants the false apostles also disguise
        themselves as servants of righteousness. The way it ends for these false apostles will be in
        step with their deeds.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Never mind that for a moment: if even we or an angel who came down from heaven
        were to evangelize to you something different than what we evangelized to you, let him be accursed.</VERS>

        Christ-revelation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In fact, you heard about the way I used to live back then when I lived as a

      <VERS vnumber="2">I went down there to discuss my conformance to a revelation, and laid out in
        front of them the glad-tidings message—the Gospel—which I preach among the Gentiles. But I submitted
        this in private to those who’re considered to be the leading figures of the movement, lest somehow
        all of this be a huge waste of time on my part—and has been all along.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">No, uh-uh—not even my companion Titus was required to be circumcised (the act
        of circumcision being the initiation rite whereby one adopts Judaism as his own religion and
        begins following its myriad rules and traditions), seeing that he’s Greek (i.e., a Westerner,
        far from being Jewish).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But because of the bogus comrades who infiltrated our movement, those in particular
        who slipped in under the radar to gain intelligence about the freedom which we possess in Christ
        Jesus, those whose aim is to enslave us—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We didn’t knuckle under to them for even a moment, so that the truth of the Gospel
        remain in effect with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the decision from those who are considered to be of some importance—just
        how important they were makes no difference to me: God doesn’t give a hoot about a person’s status,
        outward appearance, or public persona—in fact, the important people don’t score any points with
        me simply because they’re “important”…</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl"/>—Enough of that. On the contrary seeing that I had been entrusted
        with the Gospel of uncircumcision (i.e., the glad-tidings message that one can come to God through
        Christ as a Gentile without converting to Judaism and without following the Jewish rules and
        traditions) just as Peter was entrusted with the Gospel of circumcision (i.e., the glad-tidings
        message to the Jews that the Messiah promised by the Old Testament has come in the person of
        Jesus Christ),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and in this regard he who’s been active in Peter for him to be an apostle of
        the circumcised is also active for me to be the same to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Recognizing and understanding the grace (i.e., the special gift and calling given
        to me, and not earned by me) that was given to me, James, Peter, and John (those considered to
        be the key players and head honchos) were in total agreement with us giving their unequivocal
        endorsement and full support to me and Barnabas, so that we would continue as apostles to the
        Gentile and they to the circumcised (i.e., the Jews).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They only asked that we remember the poor, the very same thing I too had been
        eager to get done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Peter came to Antioch, I confronted him point-blank because he was
        in the wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You see, prior to when select individuals from the churches under James’s authority
        arrived, he partook of meals with the Gentiles, but when they arrived, he withdrew from the Gentiles
        and kept himself at a distance from them, fearing those from the circumcision (i.e., those who
        believe that one must obey the Law of Moses and adopt Jewish rules and restrictions in order
        to be accepted by God; those who say that believing in Christ but not following the Law is not
        acceptable to God).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was caught
        up in the hypocrisy…</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14"><BR art="x-nl"/>—Not a chance. When I saw that he was disingenuous about the
        truth of the Gospel, I told Peter in front of everybody, “If you being a Jew live as a Gentile
        and not as a Jew, how can you get away with requiring that the Gentiles be Jewish?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">”We ourselves are Jews by nature and not sinners from far-away, Gentile nations,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Oh, brainless, short-sighted Galatians, who cast an evil spell over you, you
        whom eye-witness accounts of Jesus Christ were previously written for, accounts describing his
        being crucified?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The only thing I want to ascertain from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit
        from the works of law (i.e., following the do’s and don’ts of the Law of Moses, or any other
        list of rules for that matter) or from hearing a particular message from the vantage point of
        faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">You’re brainless this way. Having begun in spirit (i.e., living a spiritual life;
        a life where your regenerate, human spirit, one filled with fruit, dominates your carnal nature),
        are you now continuously improving yourselves in flesh (i.e., by your own ability apart from
        God; not living a spiritual life; trying to please God by adhering to the Law of Moses, Jewish
        tradition, or other rules)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And are you so far off course that you suffered living this way for nothing?—If
        you really was for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So does he who supplies you with the Spirit and makes power (including supernatural
        power and the miraculous) happen in you do so from works of law or from a particular message
        you heard from the vantage point of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It’s just like the Old Testament verse says, “Abraham had faith in God, and it
        was credited to him as righteousness.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You really need to understand that they who live from the vantage point of faith—those
        are the ones who are sons of Abraham (i.e., imitate and duplicate Abraham; carry on Abraham’s
        legacy).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now the Scriptures anticipated the justification (i.e. clearing of one’s record
        so he’s considered to be righteous) of the Gentiles who live from the vantage point of faith—Before
        it was made widely known, God announced the good news to Abraham, telling him that, “In you a
        blessing will be imparted to all the Gentiles,”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">so that they who live from the vantage point of faith are jointly blessed with
        Abraham by means of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>You
        see, every last person without exception who seeks justification from works of law is subject
        to a curse because of what is written in the Law Moses: Cursed is everyone who doesn’t carry
        throughWith accomplishing the doing of everythingWhich has been written in the official, authoritativeVersion
        of the Law of Moses</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That no one is justified with God (i.e., has had God officially clear their
        record of wrong-doing and declared them to be righteous) by law (i.e., by an attempt to strictly
        follow the Law of Moses or by any list or rules, code of ethics, etc. for that matter) is obvious,
        since the Law of Moses says, “The righteous individual will live from the vantage point of faith.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the Law of Moses isn’t from the vantage point of faith, but instead, “He
        who does the very things commanded here shall live in them (i.e., shall live with the consequences
        one way or another).”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from (i.e., got us out from under) the curse of the Law of
        Moses, having become a curse for us (because it’s written, “Everyone who’s hung on a tree is
        accursed”)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that the blessing of Abraham would appear to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus,
        so that we’d receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith we’re talking about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Comrades, let me state this in terms of human contractual law. If a person has
        gone ahead and had a will drawn up and has had it signed, witnessed, and notarized, if he were
        to die, no one can void it, disregard it, or amend it by tacking an addendum onto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now the promises were given to Abraham and to his father-to-son direct descendant.
        The Old Testament doesn’t say “and to his direct descendants” (in the plural) but “to his direct
        descendant” (in the singular) instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What I’m getting at is this: A will was drafted, signed, witnessed, and notarized
        by God, one that can’t be invalidated by a law-code which came into being 430 years after the
        will was notarized resulting in cancelling the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Along these same lines, if the beneficiaries‘ inheritance were to be based on
        a law-code, then it would no longer be based on a promise. But God, in an act of mercy and kindness,
        has granted the inheritance to Abraham by staking it on a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So where does the Law of Moses fit in to all of this? It was added as an agency
        of grace and mercy which overlooks the transgressions which would inevitably occur, until the
        time when the father-to-son direct descendant happens to arrive, the one whom the promise was
        given to. The Law was ordained, established, and set in order through angels and physically carried
        out by the hand of a priest acting in the role of intermediary between man and God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the intermediary is not one, but God is One (i.e., the intermediary isn’t
        an incomparable, all-wise, all-encompassing, single-minded being, one who is the end-all of everything,
        but God is just that).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So is the Law of Moses compatible with the promises?—Don’t even think such a
        thought. You see, if a law-code which has the power to make a person alive was given, the righteousness
        we live in would actually be from a law-code.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Not a chance—the Scripture locked every last thing down tight under sin so that
        the promise would be given from the vantage point of faith to those who believe in Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before the Faith came, we were kept under guard, locked down with the end-goal
        in mind of the revealing of faith which was on its way,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">done in a way that the Law of Moses has become our tutor with the end-goal of
        Christ in mind, so that we would be justified from the vantage point of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now that the Faith has come, we are no longer sitting under a tutor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The fact is that all of you are sons of God through the Faith which is in Christ
        Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">In fact, without exception every last one of you who’s been baptized into Christ
        (i.e., has fully accepted and been initiated into Christ and the Christian faith) has put on
        Christ like they’ve put on a piece of clothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Westerner, there is neither slave nor person freed
        from slavery, there is neither male nor female, for all of you are in Christ Jesus (i.e., are
        melded with Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now if you are derived from Christ, you certainly are father-to-son direct descendants
        of Abraham, heirs according to the guarantee that a promise provides.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">This is what I have to say: The heir of a great estate is a minor for a long

        while at the same time being an owner of the estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Anyways, he’s kept under the supervision of a governess and a butler until the
        predetermined-date set by the minor’s father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The same thing applies to us: When we were minors, we were subject to the elementary
        principles of the world (i.e., subject to the premise of God accepting you based on how well
        you follow the list of do’s and don’ts), having reached the point where we were enslaved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the interval was up, God sent His son forth and from out of a woman
        he appeared into this world, and once he appeared he was subjected to a set of dictates in the
        form of the Law of Moses,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that he would redeem those (i.e., get them out from under) who are subjected
        to the Law, so that he would assume the authority and privileges entailed upon a son when he

      <VERS vnumber="6">Since you’re sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his son into our hearts crying,
        “Papa, Father!”,</VERS>

        Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So where is your blessing (i.e., why aren’t you wishing us well anymore)? In
        fact, I swear I’m telling you the truth, because, if possible, you plucked out your eyes and

        when the time’s right we will reap from the good we’ve sown if we don’t grow weary and quit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So then, while we still have a chance, let us continue to do good things for
        everyone, but most of all continue to do good things for the households of those who are of the
        Faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Pay attention to the capital letters I’m using here as I write this in my own
        handwriting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE THEMSELVES APPEAR ON THE OUTSIDE AS THOUGH
        THEY’RE GOOD—THEY’RE THE ONES WHO REQUIRE YOU TO BE CIRCUMCISED (i.e., to formally adopt the
        Law of Moses in the rite of circumcision, thereby committing to following it) FOR THE SOLE REASON
        THAT THEY WON’T BE PERSECUTED FOR THE CROSS OF CHRIST.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">IN FACT, THOSE WHO PROMOTE CIRCUMCISION DON’T EVEN KEEP LAW (i.e., keep the
        Law of Moses or any code of conduct for that matter) THEMSELVES. ON THE CONTRARY, THEY WANT YOU
        TO BE CIRCUMCISED SO THEY CAN BRAG IN YOUR FLESH (i.e., can brag about the amount of personal
        effort you’re putting into following the Law).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But far be it for me to brag or beam with pride except in the cross of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world (i.e., the ungodly
        established order of mankind has completely disavowed and shunned me, wanting nothing to do with
        me, and I have done the same to it).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any significance, but a new creation
        is the only thing which is significant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And whosever conforms to this standard: peace be upon him and mercy, and may
        it also be upon God’s people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Henceforth, let no one try to hassle me, for I bear the marks of Jesus in my
        body as though I’m trudging about carrying a weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18"><BR art="x-nl"/>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, comrades.

        in Christ Jesus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, He Who blessed us with
        every spiritual blessing imaginable in the spiritual domain in Christ,</VERS>

        and unblemished when subjected to His scrutiny,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">having determined beforehand that He would adopt us, making us His sons through
        Jesus Christ, according to the benevolent thought-process of His will,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">resulting in praising the glory of His grace, which in an act of mercy and kindness
        He gave us by means of the Beloved-One,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">in whom we have the Redemption (i.e., the master-plan to put our lives back to
        the way they were supposed to be) through his blood, the forgiveness of the trespasses which
        caused us to need redemption in the first place, according to the riches of His grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">which He copiously showered on us with every kind of wisdom and thought-process
        imaginable,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">having made known and understood to us the mystery of His will, according to
        His benevolent thoughts which He purposed and put forth openly in him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for the management of when the eras of history come to a head, resulting in
        the redefinition of every last thing in the Messiah, the Christ, every last thing that resides
        in the spiritual domain and on the Earth—all things in him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">in whom we also received an inheritance (i.e., things which have been parceled
        out and reserved specifically for us, and for us only, to receive or walk, spiritual or otherwise.
        The plan for us to have such things is immutable. ) which has been predestined (i.e., decided
        upon ahead of time) according to the plan and purpose of the One who works every last thing according
        to the deliberation of His will,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">resulting in us being disposed to praise His glory, we who have set our hope
        in Christ beforehand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and in whom we also, having heard the ultimate message of truth, the Gospel
        of our salvation (i.e., the good news that there is a program in place to rescue us and protect
        us from calamity), in which, now that we have believed this message, we were sealed (i.e., identified
        as belonging to someone or intended for some purpose and labeled and marked as genuine as such)
        by the guaranteed-by-promise Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who is the down payment of our inheritance up until we take delivery of what
        was purchased, resulting in praising His glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">On account of this, having heard about your expression of the Faith, a faith
        which is in the Lord Jesus, and the love which you show to all the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I also haven’t stopped offering thanksgiving for you, bringing you up in my
        prayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">so that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, will give you
        a spirit (i.e., a prevailing attitude; an all-encompassing mindset that reaches down deep into
        the heart, into your own human spirit) of wisdom and revelation in a recognition and an arrived-at,
        more precise knowledge and understanding of Him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">which is the eyes of your heart having reached the point where they’re enlightened
        resulting in us knowing for a fact what is the hope of our calling (i.e., what the full potential
        and ramifications are of us being chosen and accepted by God), what is the wealth of the glory
        of His inheritance that’s been distributed among the saints,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and what is the over-the-top greatness of His power made available to us, we
        who believe in accordance with the actuation of the might of His strength (i.e., the sheer amount
        of force He’s able to bring to bear when He unleashes his power),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">which he actuated in the Messiah, the Christ, having raised him from the dead
        and having seated him at his right hand (i.e., having taken his position of God’s chief executive
        officer) in the spiritual domain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">superseding by far all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name
        which has been named (i.e., every authority which has ever been established; every person or
        being who’s ever been given or has otherwise assumed a position of authority) not just in this
        age—no—in the Age to Come as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And He subjected all things under his feet (i.e. God made all things absolutely
        subservient to Christ, to be forcefully dominated by him), and gave him—the one who’s the head
        over all things—to the church,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">which is his body, the maximum amount which every little bit of everything is
        filled to.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And while you were dead (i.e., dead spiritually: in a stagnation of waste, joylessness,
        futility, and destruction) in your trespasses and sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in which you went about day in, day out back then according to the age (era)
        of this world (i.e., according to the philosophies, attitudes, and beliefs that are in vogue
        in this particular era of human history), according to the ruler of the authority of the air
        (i.e., according to the being who determines the underlying unseen power that influences and
        guides human society), the spirit who now works in those who take it upon themselves to be disobedient,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">you also conducted your lives this way among them back then, living by the desires
        of your flesh (i.e., your carnal nature), acting out the wants of the flesh and of the thoughts
        which randomly enter your mind, and you were by nature characterized by indulgence in violent
        emotions just like everyone else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But God, rich in mercy because of the great amount of love which He has, loved
        us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and we, dead in the trespasses I mentioned earlier, were made alive in Christ—by
        grace you have been saved—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and were raised in conjunction with him and seated jointly with him (i.e., given
        joint authority with him) in the spiritual domain in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that the over-the-top riches of His grace in goodness in Christ Jesus would
        be showcased by being lavished upon us in the coming ages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You see, by grace you have been saved through faith, and this grace—the gift
        of God—does not originate from yourselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">it does not originate from works, so that no one would have bragging-rights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You see, we are His handiwork, created in Christ Jesus in a position to handle
        the good works which God has waiting in the wings for us to occupy our day-to-day lives with.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In light of this, recall that in flesh (i.e., according to your physical bodies
        which indicate the method and means by which you approach God) you were “the Gentile Nations”
        back then, those called uncircumcised (i.e., not God’s people) by those called circumcised in
        flesh by hand (i.e., God’s people according to a ritual performed by humans),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">because in that phase of your life you were apart from Christ, excluded from
        the political and social community of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, hopeless
        and godless in the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But now you are melded with Christ Jesus; you being far away back then became
        close by the blood of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The fact is, He personally is our peace, who made both peoples into one and
        by means of his flesh tore down the dividing wall—the animus—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having abolished the wall, namely the Law of Moses which consists of the commandments
        of God enumerated in decrees, so that by means of him He would merge the two entities into one
        new entity, making peace by doing so,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and by means of one body would reconcile both to God through the cross, having
        killed the animus by means of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he went and proclaimed the glad-tidings message of peace to us who are afar
        and peace to those who are near,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">the message that through him both entities have the access I’ve been talking
        about in one Spirit to the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So I’ll state this emphatically: you’re no longer strangers and foreign-residents,
        but fellow-citizens of the saints and households of God (i.e., God’s people, historically speaking)
        instead,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">built on top of the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, Christ Jesus
        being the foundation’s main anchor point,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">in whom you too are being custom-built into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Ephesians chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now about grace of this sort: I Paul the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of
        you who are the Gentiles</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">(assuming you’ve actually heard about the responsibility assigned to me to manage
        the grace of God, grace which was conveyed by me to you),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">am telling you that through the agency of revelation the mystery of this grace
        was made known to me just as I briefly wrote about before</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for the purpose of you being able to think through my understanding of the mystery
        of Christ by reading what I wrote,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">a mystery which in other decades and centuries wasn’t made known to the average
        person like it’s now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by means of the Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">namely that the Gentiles are to be joint-heirs, to share the same body with,
        and to be joint-partakers of the promise by means of Christ Jesus through the Gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">which I became a minister of according to the gift of the grace of God which
        was given to me reflective of the actuation of His power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This very grace was given to me, the least worthy of any of the saints (i.e.,
        those who believe in Christ) to evangelize to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ—riches
        which cannot be tracked like a predator tracks its prey—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and to make visible and apparent to anyone and everyone what is the program by
        which the mystery of what has been hidden away in God Who created all things from those who lived
        in the various ages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so that at the present time the multi-faceted wisdom of God would be made known
        and understood to the demonic rulers and the demonic authorities in the spiritual domain through
        the church,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">according to the plan and purpose of the ages, which He executed by means of
        Christ Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">in whom we have the open, bold, and confident means of access in our having
        reached the point where we’re fully convinced through the faith we have in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In light of this I ask that you not lose heart in the deluge of the severe difficulties
        I face for your sake, a thing in particular which focuses on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now back to talking about grace of this sort: I genuflect before the Father,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">out of Whom every lineage, be it race, tribe, clan, family, or whatever, in
        the heavens (i.e., the sky above, heaven, and the spiritual domain) and on the earth are named
        (i.e. are assigned their role and authorities),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">that, according to the riches of His glory, He would grant you to be strengthened
        with power in the inner-self through His Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for Christ to take up residence through the faith in your hearts, while being
        rooted and anchored in love,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so that you, joined by all the saints, would be equal to the task of grasping
        the sheer magnitude of the width, length, height, and depth of this grace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and to comprehend what’s beyond comprehension—the love of Christ—so that you
        would be filled with the goal of reaching all the fullness of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now to the One Who’s able to do far above and beyond all that we ask or think,
        doing it in lockstep with the power which works in us—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus extending out to all the
        generations that will forevermore come. And let us pause a moment for that to sink in.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Ephesians chapter 3 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I ask you with all sincerity—I the prisoner in the Lord—to go about your day-to-day
        lives in a worthy manner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">with every kind of and the utmost extent of humility, gentleness, and self-restraint
        there is, with patience, putting up with one another in love,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">while being eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of the bond of
        peace—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There is one body of believers and one Spirit of God, just like the fact that
        you were called in one hope of your calling (i.e., you were summoned by God to be believers in
        a summoning that has one and only one hope in mind)—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">One Lord, one faith, one baptism (i.e. there is only one way to become a Christian,
        and it is done once only)—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">One God who occupies the role of Father of all things: namely the One Who’s on
        the top of the heap; Who all things exist on account of Him, by means of Him, and through Him;
        and Who is in, with, and among all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now the unearned gift which God gives out of His kindness was given to each individual

        Book of Psalms says, Once he ascended to a high place,He bedazzled the captives—He gave gifts
        to the people on Earth</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now as a side note, how can he who ascended (i.e., the person referred to by
        this quotation from Psalms) possibly be anyone other than the person who descended into the lower
        part of the Earth (i.e., the world beneath the Earth, the underworld, the place where the dead
        go and where hell is)?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The person who descended is the same person referred to in Psalms here who ascended
        far above all the heavens (i.e., to a position which completely supersedes and has complete dominion
        over the entire spiritual domain, including all spiritual creatures and all activity in the spiritual
        world) in order to fully take ownership of all the things that were promised to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as far as the gifts that were given, this same person—the one who both descended
        and ascended—granted that, some here and some there, there be the apostles, the prophets, the
        evangelists, and the overlapping roles of pastor and instructor (i.e., those who do one or more
        of the following: leading the congregation; instructing the congregation as to what the rules
        are; laying down rules when needed; explaining the Scriptures and the Christian faith)—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">for the equipping of the saints (i.e., the believers) towards the goal of the
        work of the ministry, towards the goal of the building up of the body of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">until—should the time ever come—we all attain the unity of the Faith and the
        recognition and the arrived-at knowledge and understanding of the Son of God, with the goal of
        becoming a full-grown man (i.e., getting our act together) to the point where we reach Christ’s
        height and body-weight,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that we’d no longer be young children, jostled and carried about by every
        wind of teaching among the cheap hustles that pool sharks dream up to con people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but, while being straight-up about the truth in a spirit of love, we would grow

        examining each part, seeing how it logically fits into the big picture, then putting the entire
        unit together—a body which is connected through every supporting ligament according to a pattern
        of operation where each one of the members does its share to cause the growth of the body towards
        the goal of the building up of itself in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">What I’m telling you—and I swear by it in the Lord—is this: No longer go about
        your day-to-day lives as the Gentiles (i.e., the random people out yonder who have no relationship
        with God; the nations which populate the earth) do in the futile, foolish, senseless, and worthless
        state of their minds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">being darkened in their end-to-end thought process, estranged from the life
        of God on account of the ignorance which exists in them and furthermore on account of the state
        of hardness, dullness, and insensitivity of their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">people in particular who, having reached the point where they’re so callous
        that they’re not bothered by the implications of what they do, have relinquished control of themselves

        pleasures towards the end-result of practicing all sorts of filthy, disgusting things in a yearning
        for more and more of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But you did not learn (i.e., successively come to appreciate and build an understanding
        of) Christ this way,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">if you really heard him and were taught by him (according to the premise that
        truth is in Jesus)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">to repeatedly put aside the old-self in regard to the former lifestyle you used

        in righteousness and holiness—without fault both from a human and from a divine perspective—derived
        from the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In light of this, now that you’ve put aside the mendacity that used to be a
        part of your conversation, as Zechariah says, “Each person ought to speak truthfully when he’s
        with his neighbor,” since you belong to one another. Psalms says,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">“Be angry and don’t sin when you are”—don’t let the sun set on your wrath (i.e.,
        be angry but don’t be consumed by the emotion, not putting the anger away when you should),</VERS>

        don’t allow him to gain a foothold anywhere).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let the person who steals no longer steal, but rather have him toil, working
        for the common good using his own hands, so that he would have the wherewithal to give to the
        one in need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Don’t let any rotten word (including ideas and topics of conversation) come
        out of your mouth, but rather let something come out of your mouth that contributes positively
        to the problem at hand, so that it would give grace (i.e., it would be a gift of kindness, graciousness,
        and goodwill to those who don’t deserve the same) to those who hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God or cause him pain, in whom you were
        sealed (i.e., certified and labeled as genuine or as belonging to someone) for a day of redemption
        (i.e. to a point in time where things are made to be what they’re supposed to be or restored
        to what they used to be).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Let any sort of bitterness, rage, anger, shouting, or blasphemy (i.e., swearing
        at someone, trash-talking about someone, smearing or slandering the reputation of someone) be
        removed from you together with any sort of malice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">In the same situations, become kind to one another, tender-hearted and compassionate,

        in Christ).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And things you ought to be ashamed of saying because they’re morally unacceptable
        or they’re obscene; and stupid, foolish babbling or sexual innuendos—that which ought not be

      <VERS vnumber="5">In fact, wrap your head around this: All fornicators, those who practice uncleanness,
        or those who are greedy (which is idolatry) don’t have an inheritance (i.e., don’t have a piece
        carved out for them) in the kingdom of Christ and God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let no one deceive you with empty words: the wrath of God comes upon the sons

        (i.e., believers) in Christ Jesus who live in Philippi together with the bishops (i.e., head
        pastors; overseers) and deacons (i.e., assistant pastors; assistants entrusted with significant
        responsibilities; heads of ministry departments):</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I give thanks to my God every time I think about you while reminiscing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">always making every one of my requests put into prayer for you all with joy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I give thanks for your working closely with me in the spreading of the Gospel
        (i.e., the good-news message of Christ) from the first day until the present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I’ve reached the point where I’m convinced of this very thing, that He who began
        a good work in you will complete it, working towards that ends until the day of Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">just as it’s right for me to be thinking about all of you this way, on account
        of me having you both in my heart and in my chains and in the verbal defense and confirmation
        of the certainty of the Gospel—you all being my fellow-workers of this grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In this regard, God is my witness to the fact that I long for all you with the
        deep, inner affections of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I pray this, that your love would proliferate even more and more in recognition,
        in more precise knowledge, and in every sort of insight gained from perception,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">resulting in your continual testing and approving of those things which excel,
        so that you would be sincere and won’t get tripped up and would maintain this to the day of Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">having reached the point where you’ve been filled from the byproduct of righteousness
        which is through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I want you to know, comrades, that the situation I find myself in has further
        advanced the Gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">in that an awareness and understanding of my bonds in Christ has been made known
        among the entire palace guard detachment and among everyone else,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and many of the comrades in the Lord, urged on by my bonds, are much more daring
        about going around speaking the word of God without fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While it’s true that some preach Christ because they’re motivated by jealousy
        and strife, on the other hand some are motivated by good intentions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While they who spread the Gospel out of love know for a fact that I’ve been
        appointed to give a verbal defense of the Gospel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">on the other hand they who proclaim Christ out of ambition and not with sincerity
        expect to stir up vexation for me while I’m in jail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So what?—except for this: that Christ is proclaimed in all respects, whether
        with ulterior motives or with no hidden agenda, and in this I rejoice—and indeed I will rejoice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">for I know for a fact that this will result in deliverance for me through your
        prayer and the support of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">in line with my eager expectation and hope that I won’t be embarrassed or humiliated
        in any way, but rather with every sort of frankness, forthrightness, and openness imaginable
        Christ will be magnified now—as always—in my body, whether through life or through death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">You see, the way I see it, to live is Christ and to die is gain (i.e., is advantageous;
        is a desirable option).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If I live on in the flesh, this will yield tangible results from my work. And
        what will I choose?—I can’t tell;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I’m caught between the two, having the desire to be set free again and to be
        together with Christ, for this is much, much better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And convinced of this I know that I will remain here on Earth and stay by your
        side—with all of you—for your progress and for the joy which comes from faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">so that your grounds for speaking proudly would proliferate in Christ Jesus
        by my doing, on account of me visiting you again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Only let your life in society be worthy of the Gospel of Christ, so that, whether
        I come and see you or am away, I hear what you’re up to, that you stand together in one spirit,
        one soul, joined together by the Faith of the Gospel</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and are not frightened and intimidated by anything done by your adversaries,
        which in particular is indicative of their ruin, but of your salvation (i.e., your being kept
        from ruin); and this intimidation-ruin-salvation pattern is from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">since the thing given—undeservedly so—to you on Christ’s behalf is to not only
        to believe in him but to suffer on his behalf,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">having the same anguish and conflict as he did, the very thing you saw happening
        to and in me and now hear reports are happening to and in me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Philippians chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So now, if there’s any comfort or exhortation in Christ, if any consolation offered
        by love, if any commonality and fellowship of spirit, if any deep, inner affection—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">you’ll make me overjoyed if you would adopt that way of thinking, having the
        same love, being harmonious and on the same page,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">with no one motivated by ambition or by conceit but by humility instead, considering
        each other to be better than yourselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">not paying careful attention to your own affairs exclusively but instead paying
        careful attention to each other’s affairs as well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Maintain in you the way of thinking that was also in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who, while existing in the form of God, didn’t think being equal to God was a
        thing that had to be to be held onto with everything you’ve got,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but instead depleted himself and assumed the form of a slave, having turned into
        something similar to humans, and, unveiled to the public having the appearance of that of a human
        being,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">he humbled himself and became obedient until it reached a point where the obedience
        required his death, not just any-old death but the death of crucifixion on a cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And in light of this, God exalted him (i.e., promoted him to a high position)
        and out of His generosity gave him the name which is above all names (i.e., gave him the ultimate
        top rank, outranking every other rank),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so that in the name of Jesus (i.e. when Jesus’s authority is invoked) every
        knee would bow of the things in the heavens (i.e., in heaven; in the spiritual domain) and of
        the things on the Earth and of the things under the earth (i.e., the world of the dead, including
        hell)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and every tongue would confess out loud that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
        of God the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So now, my dear comrades, just as you have always obeyed, not just when I was
        there in person but even more in my absence, work at the salvation where your own selves are
        concerned with the utmost reverence and respect;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">you see, God is the One Who’s working in you both the wanting and the working-on
        of what pleases Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do all things while distancing yourselves from grumbling and scheming or plotting,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that you would become blameless and innocent, children of God in the midst
        of a crooked and perverted Zeitgeist, in which you shine as lights in the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">holding fast to a message of life, resulting in me having proud words to tell
        others up to the day of Christ, since you haven’t run life’s race or toiled for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Anyways, if I’m being poured out like a libation upon the altar and during the
        liturgy of your faith, I will rejoice and will rejoice together with you all—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the same for you: you will rejoice and will rejoice together with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you posthaste, so that once
        I know what you’re up to, it’ll put me at ease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have no one, you see, who sees things the way I do, a certain someone who’ll
        truly care for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In fact, everyone I’ve tried to find to work with me is pursuing their own self-interests,
        not the interests of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But you’re familiar with how he qualified to receive my trust, that he served
        me in the Gospel like a son serves a father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So I certainly hope to send this fellow as I could immediately turn my attention
        to my affairs were he to be sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">I’m convinced in the Lord of the same, that I too will come posthaste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I deemed it necessary that I send you Epaphroditus, my comrade, coworker, and
        fellow soldier-in-arms—your missionary and my personal attendant—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">since he was longing to see all of you and was quite distressed because you
        heard that he was rundown with some sort of sickness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">You see, he was weakened by sickness to the point of death, but instead of him
        dying God had mercy on him, and not just on him but on me too so that I wouldn’t be wrenched
        with pain upon pain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So with even more urgency I sent him on his way so that after seeing him again
        you would rejoice and I would be relieved of my pain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So receive him in the Lord with all the joy you can muster, and honor individuals
        like him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">since he came close to death on account of Christ’s work, risking his very life
        so that he would fill in the gap caused by your drop-off in serving me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Philippians chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In conclusion, my dear comrades, rejoice in the Lord. It’s no problem at all
        for me to write this over and over, and it’ll keep you from careening into a ditch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Look at the dogs (i.e., those who are worthless, contemptuous people who live
        like animals; those who are excluded from having a covenant with God) and don’t stop looking
        at them, look at those who do evil, look at the anti-circumcision (i.e., those who think they
        have a covenant with God but the opposite is true).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The fact of the matter is that we are the circumcision (i.e., you’re the ones
        who actually have a covenant with God), the ones who have a service of worship in the Spirit
        of God and make audacious remarks in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh (i.e.,
        in your own selves; in your abilities apart from God to please God; in your ability to gain God’s
        favor by simply following a list of rules; in your human credentials),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">although I have confidence in the flesh. If some other person has confidence
        in the flesh, I have more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Circumcised on the eighth day; an Israeli by race, of the tribe of Benjamin,
        a Hebrew who stands out among the Hebrews; a Pharisee who was totally committed to doing everything
        according to the Law of Moses;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as far as the intensity of his zeal, a person who was persecuting the church;
        as far as his pursuit of a righteousness (i.e., a means of standing before God and telling Him
        why He should approve of your life) which is generated by means of following the Law, faultless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Never mind all that—whatever gain (i.e., advantages) I had, I consider it to
        be lost (i.e., to have been forfeited) on account of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Oh, no, no—even I consider everything forfeited on account of the surpassing
        greatness and excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom everything
        has been forfeited, and I consider everything to be garbage and crap so that I may gain Christ</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and that I would be found in him not having my own righteousness, one which is
        derived from following the Law but instead one which is through the faith of Christ, which is
        a righteousness from God on the basis of the Faith—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">to come to know him and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of and
        participation in his sufferings, while being conformed to his death,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Not that I’ve already attained these things I’m writing about or have reached
        the point of perfection, but I’m chasing after these things in the hope that I just might put
        them under my thumb, on the basis of me having been put under the thumb by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Comrades, I don’t figure that I’ve reached the point where I’ve put these things
        under my thumb, but I do this one thing: I forget about what’s behind me and press on to what

      <VERS vnumber="8">who also told us about your love in the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">On account of this, since the days when you first heard the Gospel, we haven’t

        body (i.e., the removal of that carnal, I-can-do-it-myself-without-God human nature locked up
        in the body) by the circumcision of Christ (i.e., by analogy removing the carnality and do-it-yourself
        nature like removing the foreskin in circumcision),</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>From Paul, Silas, and Timothy: To the church
        of Thessalonica in the Father-God and the Lord Jesus Christ:Grace to you and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We’re always thanking God for all of you, bringing you up in prayer, continuously</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">remembering your work of the Faith, your toil of the Love of God, and your steadfastness
        of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">knowing full-well, comrades loved by God, your selection (i.e., God’s selection
        of you to be His),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that our Gospel, the glad-tidings message which drew us together, did not present
        itself to us in word only but also in supernatural power and in the Holy Spirit and with much
        conviction, just as you know full-well what sort of men we turned out to be while among you throughout
        our stay with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you became people who imitate us and the Lord, having received (i.e., having
        fully embraced) the word in the midst of a good deal of tribulation but with the joy of the Holy
        Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so much so that you turned out to be a role-model for all the believers in Macedonia
        and in the Roman province of Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In fact the word of the Lord sounded forth from you (i.e., you loudly and thoroughly
        announced, advertised, and disseminated the word of the Lord) not just in Macedonia and in Asia
        but in every place your faith in God went out, so much so that there’s no need for us to be doing
        any more talking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore, the Macedonians and Asians personally are letting everyone know
        what an impact we’ve had on you, and how you turned to God, having turned from the idols you
        were serving to serve a living and true God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and to wait for His son to come out of heaven, whom He raised from the dead,
        Jesus who’s rescuing us from the coming wrath.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In fact you yourselves know full-well, comrades, that the impact we had on you
        wasn’t a waste of time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">rather, having suffered before and having been treated with insolence (as you’re
        well aware), in Philippi we were emboldened in our God to tell you God’s good-news message, the
        Gospel, while in the face of a lot of opposition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In fact, our encouragement was not from us being in error or from an uncleanness
        (i.e., something dirty, impure, or something one should stay away from), nor did it exist in
        deceit or guile,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but instead it’s in line with the way we’ve been granted by God to be entrusted
        with the Gospel—that’s the way we speak, not like we’re speaking to people in a way where we’re
        trying to make them happy but like we’re speaking to God in a way to make Him happy instead,
        Who approves or disapproves of what’s in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For there was never a time when we showed up with a flattering message (as you’re
        well aware), nor did we show up having a pretext for covetousness—so help me God—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">nor did we show up seeking prestige or fame, not from you or from anyone else,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">though, as Christ’s apostles, we’re capable of throwing our weight around. Instead,
        we became infants while in your midst. The way a nursing mother cherishes her own children</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">is the same way that we, having a strong yearning for you, thought it well to
        share not only the Gospel of God but also the things that make us live and breathe themselves.
        Therefore, you became dear to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore, recollect, comrades, our back-breaking labor and toil: we worked
        day and night so that we wouldn’t be a burden on any of you. Under these circumstances we preached
        the Gospel of God to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You—and God—can attest to just how pious, correct, and faultless the demeanor
        was that we presented to you who are believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Just as you know from experience that we treated each one of you like a father
        treats his own children,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">we were comforting, exhorting, advising, consoling, cheering, and issuing statements
        for you to conduct your day to day lives in a manner worthy of God, Who calls us to His Own kingdom
        and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And we thank God continuously because of this as well, since, having received
        (i.e., wholeheartedly embraced) God’s message (His systematic reasoning; His word) verbally communicated
        from us to you, you didn’t receive a man-made message but instead you received it just as it
        actually is: God’s true message, a message which is also at work in you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You see comrades, you followed the pattern set by the churches of God in Christ
        Jesus which are in Judea, in that you too suffered the same things done to you by your own countrymen
        like what was done to them by their fellow Judeans,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who also killed the Lord Jesus and the Old Testament prophets and persecuted
        us. These countrymen live lives which are not pleasing to God; they are against all of humanity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">hindering us from getting to speak to the Gentiles so that they could be saved
        (i.e., receive Christ as savior), the end-result being that every time they commit sin, they
        do it to the maximum extent; the wrath of God came upon them to the utmost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But we, comrades, bereft of you for a short while—bereft from being there in
        person with you and not bereft of heart—with tremendous desire we all the more hastened to see
        your faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore we wanted to visit you—certainly I did, Paul—I started making arrangements
        once or twice but Satan thwarted us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The fact of the matter is this: Who is our hope, our joy, or trophy which we
        beam with pride over—if not you—yes you—joy of you being in the presence of our Lord with his
        coming?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You are our pride and joy, you see.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In light of this, as we could no longer stand it, we thought it best to stay
        behind in Athens by ourselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and so we sent Timothy, our comrade and fellow-worker of God in the Gospel (i.e.
        the good-news message) of Christ, for the purpose of getting you to stand on your own two feet
        and encouraging, advising, and comforting you in regard to your faith</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">so as to not be agitated or emotionally upset in these times of distress; in
        fact, you yourselves know full-well that this is our fate in life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Furthermore, when we were with you, we kept telling you ahead of the fact that
        hard times are coming, just as it both happened and you know for a fact that it did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because of this and because I couldn’t stand it any longer, I made inquiries
        to ascertain your faith, lest somehow the Temptor tempted you and our labor turned out to be
        for nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Just now Timothy arrived here at our place coming from your place and gave us
        good news in regard to your faith and your love and gave us the good news that you always remember
        us in a good way, longing to see us just we long to see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because of this we were encouraged and comforted, comrades, in what we hear about
        you on account of your faith while staring point-blank at all our needs and afflictions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">because we’re infused with life and vitality now if it is the case that you stand
        in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In fact, how can we possibly thank God enough for you for all the joy we’ve been
        elated with in the presence of God because of you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">day and night begging in prayer over and beyond the point of excess to see your
        face and repair the deficiencies of your faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">May our God and our Father and our Lord Jesus set us on a straight course to
        see you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">May the Lord cause you to abound and increase in the love which you show to
        one another and to all people, just as we also show to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">with the end-goal of establishing your hearts blameless in holiness under the
        scrutiny of our God and Father in the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints (i.e., his
        followers).</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 1 Thessalonians chapter 3 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In conclusion, comrades, we ask you in the Lord—plead with you—that you go to
        higher and higher levels in your being pleasing to God in your day to day lives in a way which
        is consistent with the instructions you received from us (which is consistent with the way you
        are currently living your lives).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The fact of the matter is that you know some of the instructions we gave you
        through the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In fact, this is the will of God (your holiness is the will of God!): it is for
        you to abstain from the fornication you’re surrounded by (i.e., by the loose sexual morals we
        all know about);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for each of you to know how to gain possession and keep possession of his own
        personal container (i.e., his body, the container for his soul and spirit) in holiness and dignity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not in an intense, all-consuming feeling of lust (just like the Gentiles who
        don’t know God)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but in not stepping out of line and taking advantage of or defrauding his fellow-comrade
        in the matter of sexual morality. Because of this the Lord takes vengeance in issues pertaining
        to these transgressions, consistent with the way we told you previously, telling it in a dead-serious
        manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fact of the matter is that God has not called you to uncleanness (i.e., God’s
        intention for your life in His kingdom was not to commit filthy, disgusting deeds) but rather
        to live in holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Consequently, he who disregards this command isn’t disregarding a human being
        but is disregarding God instead, Who gives His Holy Spirit to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now about brotherly-love (i.e., having strong likings for other comrades): you
        don’t need to have any instruction or advice written to you on this subject, seeing that you
        yourselves are God-instructed in the love one should have for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In fact, you also extend the same practices to all the comrades all over Macedonia.
        We beg you, comrades, to do even more</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and make it a goal to be still (i.e., not be stirred by loud, negative emotions),
        to do your own things (i.e., concentrate on your own lives), and to work with your own hands
        (i.e., don’t rely on others to do your work), and do these things in line with the way we recommended,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that the way you conduct your lives would leave a good impression on those
        on the outside and so that you won’t need anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We don’t want you to be kept in the dark, comrades, about those who sleep (i.e.,
        the believers who are already dead), so that you won’t grieve like the others, the ones who have
        no hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">To this point, if we believe that Jesus died and rose from the dead, then we
        are also entitled to believe that God will take those who sleep through Jesus (i.e., those who
        died trusting in Jesus) along together with him the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">In fact, we’re telling you this in a word of the Lord (i.e., in a prophetic
        message from the Lord): you the living who remain on the Earth until the coming of the Lord will
        absolutely not arrive at the destination before those who sleep,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">because the Lord himself—with the shout of a command by the voice of an archangel
        and by God’s bugle call—will come down from heaven, and first the dead in Christ will be resurrected
        (i.e., brought back to life),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then you who are alive who remain on the Earth will be taken together with them
        as a single unit into the clouds to a meeting with the Lord in the air—And that’s the way we’ll
        always be with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The bottom line is that we should comfort and exhort each other with these words.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Concerning the times (i.e., the year, day, or month significant events will occur)
        and the seasons (i.e., the atmosphere that defines the era events occur in; the climate the events
        occur in), comrades, you don’t need for me to write to you anything;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the fact is that you know full well in yourselves and to a tee that the nature
        of the day of the Lord is that it comes in the same way as a thief in the night hits and runs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When they (i.e., everybody out there) are saying, “Peace and security,” then
        suddenly and unexpectedly destruction and ruin are perched on top of them staring down on them
        just like labor pains suddenly come upon a pregnant woman and there’s no way she can run away
        at that point and escape them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But you, comrades, aren’t in darkness (i.e., you aren’t being kept in the dark
        about this) so that that day would overwhelm you like a thief would;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for you all are sons of (i.e., you adopt the characteristics of) light and sons
        of day—We aren’t sons of night or sons of darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So then don’t sleep (i.e., becoming spiritually dormant) like everyone else,
        but be watchful (i.e., stay focused) and sober (i.e., don’t let anything degrade your heightened
        state of alertness) instead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see, those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who are drunkards
        do their drinking at night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you’re in a state where you’re sober during the day, now that you’ve put
        on a breast-plate of faith and love and a helmet that is the hope of salvation (i.e., of escaping
        destruction, in this context the wrath of God),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">because God didn’t put us in a position that’s towards wrath but He put us in
        a position that’s headed towards acquiring salvation (i.e., acquiring a means of escape, in this
        context from the wrath of God) through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who died for us so that whether we happen to watch (i.e., remain alive and stay
        focused) or whether we happen to sleep (i.e., die) we would live together in the same time and
        place with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In light of this, comfort one another and edify each other one-on-one just like
        you’re already doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We ask you, comrades, to know from first-hand observation those among you who
        do hard work and who have stepped forward to stand in leadership positions in the Lord and who
        advise, warn, admonish, and instruct you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13"><BR art="x-nl"/>and to have a superabundant high regard for them in love on
        account of their work. Keep the peace among yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>We plead with you, comrades,
        that you advice, warn, admonish, and instruct the disorderly and insubordinate. Cheer up those
        who are discouraged.Take a strong interest in and help those who are weak (i.e., those who are
        unwell; worn out with a sickness; too physically weak to take care of themselves; powerless to
        do anything about their circumstances). Exercise patience with everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">See that no one, when somebody does something bad to them, retaliates by doing
        something bad back to them, but instead pursues the common good and the general good at all times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Rejoice all the time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Pray incessantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Give thanks in the midst of all circumstances; you see, this is the will of
        God for you in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do not extinguish or put out the Holy Spirit when he’s burning. Do not quench,
        stifle, or suppress the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Do not despise, treat with contempt, or have utter disdain for prophesy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but examine all things including prophesies instead and accept the good and
        reject the bad and hold onto the good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Stay away from any appearance of evil or wrong-doing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">We ought to thank God for you all the time, comrades—as it’s worth doing—because
        your faith is growing off the charts, and the love which every one of you has towards each other

        God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Just as I advised you to remain in Ephesus while on my way to Macedonia so that
        you would impress upon certain individuals not to go about teaching things which are…shall we
        say…different</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">or to take myths or endless genealogies seriously (the very things which generate
        a lot of stupid questions), more seriously than one takes godly stewardship, a stewardship which
        is by means of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the bottom line of the command that they’re charged with is love from a clean
        heart and a good conscience,</VERS>

        discussion,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing this for certain: law (i.e., the Law of Moses in particular or any code
        of right and wrong for that matter) was put in place for a reason, not for someone who lives
        right but for the lawless, for those who refuse to submit to authority, for those who aren’t
        pious, for those who murder their fathers, their mothers, their brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for fornicators (i.e., those who indulge in gross sexual immorality), for homosexuals,

        doctrine that I’ve been entrusted with.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">me who used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and one who was insolent and violent—but
        no—He showed mercy since I did these things when I didn’t know better while I was in unbelief,</VERS>

        is in Christ Jesus.</VERS>

        Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, I myself being the foremost.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">I don’t permit a woman to give instructions for what a person should or shouldn’t

      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank God and have gracious thoughts for Him, Whom I serve with a clean conscience
        in a worship which originated from my ancestors, as I constantly rehash memories of you all day
        and all night while I’m chained up in prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">yearning so much to see you (now that I’ve remembered something of your tears)

        which is in you through my laying on of hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see, God didn’t give us a deep, intense, overriding attitude of cowardliness,
        but of power, love, and a self-control which results in us being sensible and sound-minded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So don’t be ashamed of us telling others in a serious manner what the truth is
        about our Lord nor be ashamed about me his prisoner, but rather participate in the evil-generated

        power of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Who saved us and called us (i.e., summoned us to be believers) by a holy calling,

      <VERS vnumber="11">Towards that goal I have been given the positions of preacher, apostle (i.e.,
        missionary), and teacher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That’s also the reason I suffer the things I suffer, but—no—I’m not ashamed
        of it, for I know whom I have believed in and am convinced that he’s capable of guarding what
        I’ve been entrusted with until that day arrives.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So let us fear lest any one of you seem to come up short while there lingers
        a promise to enter His rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You see, we too were given a good news message (the Gospel) just as those people
        were, but no—the verbally-given message from God did not benefit those people, not having been
        blended with faith by those who heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>The fact
        of the matter is that those who believed the message enter into the rest that we’re discussing
        here indicated by what He has stated:As I swore I would do in My outburst of wrath: “There’s
        not a chance that they’ll enter My rest.”…Referring to another rest even though the result of
        the things which were done during creation has been in existence since the world was initially
        created.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>To elaborate on this point, somewhere in the Old Testament
        (in a place we’re all too familiar with) He made a statement about Saturday that goes like this:And
        God rested on the seventh day from all of His works</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/>Plus what’s in this verse: There’s not a chance that
        they’ll enter My rest</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So since what’s left over after all of this (and has yet to be dealt with) is
        for some people to enter His rest, and since the previous group of people who were told about
        the good things God intended for them didn’t enter any rest because of disobedience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>this topic is addressed again in the
        Old Testament: After this huge gap in time, a specific day referred to as “today” is defined
        by David according to the way it’s spoken of in Psalms:If you happen to hear His voice today,Don’t
        harden your hearts</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You see, if Joshua gave them a rest of any sort, he wouldn’t have been talking
        about another time after this period of time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, what’s left on the table is a Sabbath observance for God’s people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The fact is, he who entered into (i.e., joined in body, mind, and spirit) His
        rest is also the same person who rested from his works just as God rested from His own work of
        creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So let’s be eager and in a hurry to enter into that rest, so that no one will
        fail by the same pattern of disobedience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">You see, the word of God is living, active and effective, and sharper than any
        double-edged sword and is able to penetrate to the extent of separating soul (i.e., the mind,
        will, and emotions) and spirit into different parts, and of separating joint and marrow, and
        is able to judge, deciding between right and wrong, the thoughts, reflections, and thinking processes
        of a heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There’s no kind of person, no person anywhere, who’s invisible or undetectable
        when subjected to His intense gaze, but everyone is stripped naked and cracked wide open under
        His scrutiny, with which this same statement applies to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So having a great high priest who has traversed the sky and outer space and
        reached heaven, Jesus the son of God, let us adhere to the articles of the confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You see, we don’t have a high priest who’s unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
        but one who has been tested, tempted, and pushed to the breaking point in every category and
        in identical ways apart from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So let us approach the throne of grace with boldness to receive mercy and find
        grace, the end result being help at the right time.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Hebrews chapter 4 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The fact of the matter is that every high priest drawn from the pool of human
        beings for the benefit of mankind is appointed to a position in regard to those things pertaining
        to God in order to offer offerings, plus sacrifices on top of that, on behalf of sinners,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being able to moderate his feelings, restrain himself, and be gentle to the ignorant,
        to those who lack understanding, to those who are mistaken, and to those who’ve gone astray,
        since he too is engulfed in human frailty,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because of this same frailty, just like what affects the folk-people, he’s
        obliged just the same to offer up offerings over and over again in matters where his own sins
        are involved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Furthermore, any-old person can’t do the honor and appoint himself to the position
        of high priest, but instead the one called by God to be a high priest gets to be appointed just
        like Aaron was appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>In the same way Christ didn’t become
        a high priest in a self-aggrandizing manner—uh-uh—his appointment was in line with what was spoken
        to him:You are My sonToday I have begotten you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>This is also consistent with what a
        different verse says: You are a priest and will be one forevermoreAccording to the order of Melchizedek</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who, during the time when he had a human body, offered up an offering of prayers
        plus humble, earnest, urgent requests for protection on top of that to the One having the power
        to continually rescue and protect him from death, praying with loud crying and tears, and he
        was listened to and heeded because of the reverent awe he had in the presence of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Although he was a son, he learned the obedience required of him from the things
        he suffered,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and once the items of obedience that were required of him were finished, he became
        a source of eternal salvation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">designated by God to be a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There’s a lot we were wanting to go over with you on this topic, and it’s difficult
        to explain anything to you since you’ve gotten to where you don’t listen very well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In fact, you should be teachers by this time, but instead you need to have someone
        come and teach you the fundamentals of the word of God all over again, and have gotten to where
        you require milk and can’t handle solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, anyone who’s on a milk-only diet has not demonstrated competency in
        those things which have their origin in the subject of righteousness: he’s an infant, you see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for grown-ups, who in the course of their maturity have developed
        and trained their faculties of perception to distinguish both good and bad.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In light of this, putting aside the subject material of the fundamental doctrines
        of Christ, let us forge ahead, not again laying a foundation comprised of repentance (i.e., a

        are unable to engage again in the process of renewing themselves with the goal of repentance

      <VERS vnumber="1">You see, this Melchizedek, king of Jerusalem, priest of God the Highest, who
        met with Abraham when he was returning from the Battle of Siddim and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom Abraham gave ten percent of everything he owned, whose name is first
        and foremost translated “King of Righteousness” then subsequent to that “King of Salem” (that

      <VERS vnumber="3">who’s described in the Bible as being fatherless, motherless, having no genealogy,
        having no period of time which was early-on for him nor an end-of-life period but made to resemble
        the son of God, remains a priest into perpetuity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Observe how great this fellow is whom the patriarch Abraham gave ten percent
        of the spoils from that battle to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those who are included in the family tree of the sons of Levi, being endowed
        with the priesthood, indeed possess a commandment from the Law of Moses to receive tithes (i.e.,
        ten percent) from the folk-people (their kinsmen in other words), although they had yet to leave
        the loins of Abraham (i.e., they had yet to be born).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he who’s not descended from them or is included in their genealogy collected
        a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one in possession of the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Indisputably, the inferior person was blessed by the superior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In this case people who die receive tithe payments, but in that case a statement
        of fact is on record that he who receives tithe payments is alive and continues to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A comment can be made along these lines that the tithe-receiving sons of Levi
        pay a tithe through Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You see they were in the loins of the patriarch yet to be born when Melchizedek
        met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So if the Levitical priesthood really was the end-all (the folk-people, you
        see, based their system of religious regulations on it), why was there a need for another priest
        to come to prominence, one who’s described as belonging to the order of Melchizedek and not to
        Aaron’s order?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The fact is, a changing of the priesthood necessitates a change in law (i.e.,
        a change to the rules which govern religious observance and as part of that the establishment
        a priesthood).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, the person whom these things address belongs to another tribe, a tribe
        for which there is no mention of attending to the altar (i.e., of any priestly duties).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In this regard, it’s clear that our Lord broke through like the sun peering
        over the horizon in the morning in the tribe of Judah, a tribe for which the Law of Moses has
        no mention of priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It’s even more clear that that there’s another priest coming to prominence,
        one who resembles Melchizedek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">a priest who has not come into being according to a law of commandment of flesh
        (i.e., according to rules which require you to be of a certain lineage) but rather according

      <VERS vnumber="18">The cancellation of a previously-instituted commandment which established a
        priesthood certainly occurs on account of said-commandment’s frailty and uselessness.</VERS>

        priests are priests apart from there being any oath…And the fact is, those who are designated
        by the Law to be priests have become priests apart from there being an oath,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but on the other hand, the priesthood which replaces it was established with
        an oath by means of what was spoken to him, “The Lord God swore an oath and won’t rescind it:
        ‘You are a priest and will be one forevermore’.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">…To that extent Jesus has become a guarantee of a better covenant.</VERS>

        priesthood in perpetuity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As a result, he’s also able to totally, completely, and continually save (i.e.,
        to protect, preserve, and prevent from harm) those who come to God through him, always alive
        and ready to intercede for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You see, such as I described is what we have: a fitting, appropriate, relevant
        high priest, one who is holy, innocent, and unsullied, separated from the sinners he intercedes
        for and situated higher than the sky, the spiritual world, and heaven itself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">one who doesn’t need (like the high priests need) to offer up a sacrifice each
        day for his own sins first, then and only then to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people,
        since he did this one time when he offered up himself as a sacrifice for sin and is done with
        it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You see, the Law put men who have a weakness (i.e., limitations; shortcomings)
        in place as high priests; but the message contained in the oath, a message which was made after
        the Law established its priesthood, forevermore established as high priest a son who has been
        made to be the end-all and who has been made complete ad-infinitum.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The crux of the argument given here is this: we have such a high priest, a priest

      <VERS vnumber="8">This is what the Holy Spirit is signifying: while the outer sanctuary still exists
        and is being actively used, the way into the Holy of Holies has not yet been revealed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">a particular concept which is analogous to the period of time which has arrived
        and is presently in operation, which according to this analogy means that the offering up of
        offerings and sacrifices is powerless to bring those performing the rituals to completeness along
        the lines of conscience;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the regulations involved with eating, drinking, various kinds of ceremonial
        washings were physical and self-originated acts only, imposed until a period of reform happened
        to arrive and change things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Christ showed up as a high priest of the good things which came into being because
        of the greater and more perfect tabernacle, which is not hand-made (in other words, not of this
        planet).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It was not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood that he entered
        once and for all into the Holy of Holies and obtained eternal release and deliverance from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, if the blood of bulls and goats and the sprinkling of the ashes of
        an incinerated heifer make those who’ve been defiled pristine and undefiled again to the producing
        of the purity of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered
        himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works resulting in you serving
        the Living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because of this, he’s the mediator of a new covenant, so that, considering that
        a death occurred for the redemption (i.e., the settling of something; fixing what’s broken) of
        the transgressions which were committed under the first covenant, those who’ve been called to
        be God’s people would partake of the eternal inheritance (i.e., the things God has immutably
        and irrevocably reserved for them and intended for them to have).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The fact of the matter is that where a last will and testament (which is what
        a covenant is) is concerned, it’s necessary that the death of the will’s testator be proven legally.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You see, upon the death of the testator the will is frozen as-is and can no
        longer be amended in any way; it never has that immutability-strength while the testator is still
        alive and therefore able to amend it at any time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hence, the first covenant was not instituted apart from the inclusion of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In fact, once every commandment in the Law was spoken to all the people by Moses,
        taking the blood of calves and goats mixed with water, red wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled the
        scroll he read from itself and all the people</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">while saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you to
        keep.&quot;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In addition he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the serving vessels used in
        the rituals in blood the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">It’s almost as though it’s an Old Testament axiom that according to the Law
        of Moses everything is purified and cleansed by blood, and apart from the shedding of blood any
        sort of forgiveness of sin doesn’t happen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">While the copies of the things in the spirit-world (i.e., the copies being the
        earthly tabernacle and items in it) need to be cleansed by these things (i.e., by the blood of
        calves, of goats, etc.), but the actual things in the spirit-world that the earthly things are
        a copy of require better sacrifices than the ones offered on earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You see, Christ didn’t enter a Holy of Holies that was created by human hands,
        these man-made things merely being symbolic representations and mirror-copies of the real things,
        but instead entered into the same thing (i.e., the thing which the symbolic representations are
        based on) which is in the spirit-world, to be seen by, to be known by, and to be subjected to
        God’s intense scrutiny on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor is it the case that he repetitively brings himself into this Holy of Holies
        in the spirit-world just like the high priest enters the earthly Holy of Holies each year with
        another batch of blood to be sprinkled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If that were the case, he would have to suffer and die on the cross many times
        starting the moment the human race began; but at this this critical moment in the annuls of history,
        he appeared this once for the obliteration of the sin of mankind because of his sacrifice having
        been disclosed and made known to everyone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And reflective of the fact that it’s been allocated that every person in the
        human race undergo death once and only once and after this undergo judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">in the same way as this, Christ, having been brought forth one time only for
        the purpose of being offered up for the sins of the many, will be seen a second time apart from
        sin (i.e., he’ll make a second appearance, and this appearance will have nothing to do with atoning
        for sins) by those who assiduously and eagerly look to him for salvation (i.e., look to him to
        protect them from potential harm, whatever that might be).</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Hebrews chapter 9 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">You see, the Law, containing a shadow of the good things to come and not itself
        the form which casts the things’ shadow, by the same sacrifices that are continuously being offered
        year after year can never complete or perfect those who approach God in this way;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">otherwise, wouldn’t these sacrifices ceased to have been offered because those
        performing the rituals would have no more sins on their consciences once they had been cleansed?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">No—in doing those things year after year, there’s a reminder of sins that need
        to be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The fact of the matter is that it’s impossible for the blood of bulls and goats
        to take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>In this light, while entering the world

        burnt offerings and the like surrounding sin” were “not what You wanted” nor were You “pleased”
        with them, the very offerings which are offered as prescribed by the Law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said, “‘Hey, I have come…to do Your will.” He gets the first (i.e., the
        sacrifices, offerings, and burnt offerings) out of the way so that the second (i.e., Jesus’s
        coming to do God’s will) would stand in its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By the will of God referred to in this passage, we will be sanctified (i.e.,
        set apart from sin and made holy) through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for
        all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Day after day every priest has taken a stand performing the ritualistic service
        of worship, serving the same sacrifices which have been offered many a time, things in particular
        which can never remove sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But after this fellow Jesus offered one sacrifice for sins that would last ad
        infinitum, he sat down at the right hand of God (i.e., assumed the position of God’s chief executive),</VERS>

        under his feet (i.e., that they be completely squashed and enslaved).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You see, by the offering up of one offering he has perpetually completed, finished,
        and perfected those being sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But on this topic the Holy Spirit also gives us supporting evidence; you see,
        he has stated afterwards,</VERS>

        deeds and our body washed (analogous to the ceremonial washings that were done under the Law)

      <VERS vnumber="1">Faith is the undergirding of what’s hoped for, the proof of things not seen (which
        includes all things for which there is no physical evidence);</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">by this, you see, those we hold in esteem from long ago had an official account,
        a favorable mention, of their actions recorded for posterity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith our mind understands that the world was set in order by a sentence spoken
        by God, resulting in what we see coming into being out of what hasn’t been manifested.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered God a much better sacrifice than Cain, through which an
        attestation to him being righteous was entered into the official record, the record specifying
        the gifts he offered to God, and through his faith, though he’s dead he’s still speaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was instantaneously transported from one place to another for
        the purpose of not experiencing death; “There was no trace of him to be found because God had
        transported him.” You see, before he was transported, it had been stated for the record that
        he had pleased God quite well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now apart from faith it’s impossible to be well-pleasing to God, for he who approaches
        God must believe (and have already believed ahead of time) that He is the Great I Am and that
        a reward manifests itself and is awarded to those who seek Him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, having been warned by God about things that had not yet been seen,
        in piety and in the fear of God built and provisioned an ark for the purpose of preserving his
        family and keeping it safe, through which faith he condemned the world (i.e., consigned the world
        to punishment) and became an heir of the righteousness which comes from faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was summoned to leave the place he lived and
        go to the place which he was going to receive as an inheritance (i.e., a place which was reserved

        is causing this, lest some root of bitterness grow up and become a source of irritation, annoyance,

        if those people who disregarded or rejected what was called for couldn’t escape after He warned

        shake the Earth but the sky, outer space, and the spirit-world too.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the phrase “yet one more time” insinuates the removal of those things which
        are shaken, as they are things which have been created, so that what would remain would be the
        things which can’t be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">In light of this, as we heartily embrace a kingdom which can’t be shaken, let

      <VERS vnumber="1"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>James, a servant/slave of God and of the Lord
        Jesus Christ: To the blood-descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel who are among the Diaspora
        (i.e. the scattering of Jews all over the world): I’m delighted to write to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Consider it a joy, my dear comrades, when you by chance fall into various tests
        and trials which find out what you’re made of,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">knowing that the process of proving your faith produces perseverance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let perseverance have the opportunity to become a mature, completed work, in
        order that you would become mature and that every part of you would become complete with nothing
        left out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But speaking of things which are left out…If someone is lacking in wisdom, advise
        him to simply ask for wisdom from the giving-God who’ll grant the request without chewing the
        person out or demeaning him, and it will be given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But admonish him to ask in faith, nothing about him wavering in doubt: you see,
        a person who doubts is like the way that ocean waves are moved and tossed about by the wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To this point, you should adjust that person’s expectations so that he does not
        expect to receive anything from the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">since he is a double-minded man, irresolute in all his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Get the Humiliated, Abased Person to glory and take pride in his exaltation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and likewise get the rich man to practice humility and self-abasement, because,
        like the wild flowers of the field which reach an apex when they blossom and then fade back into
        obscurity, he too will have his moment in the sun then pass away and fade back into obscurity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You see, the sun rose and dried out the wild flower with its sweltering heat,
        its flower-part fell off, and the lovely appearance it projected was destroyed—this is the same
        way that the rich man will waste away in his journey through life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Blessed is the man who perseveres over the course of tests and trials, since,
        after he’s attained approval because of his perseverance, he’ll receive the trophy of a deeply
        satisfying life, which is promised to those who love Him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Teach the person who’s being tested by some sort of trial or temptation not
        to say, “I’m being tested by God to see if there’s any evil in me.” You see, God is un-tempt-able
        by any evil; He tempts no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Each person is tempted when he’s lured and dragged off by the passions which
        are peculiar to him and not necessarily to the next person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then once passion or desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin. When it’s
        finished running its course, sin produces death (i.e., stagnation of waste, joylessness, futility,
        and destruction).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Don’t get led down the primrose path, my dear comrades.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Every good gift and every perfect present is from the sky above, coming down
        from the Creator of Astronomical Objects (i.e. the sun, the moon, stars, etc.), with whom there
        is no deviation in the movement of such objects and no hint or suggestion of change to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Having planned and decided to do so, he birthed us in a conceptualization of
        truth with the end-goal of us being the crème de la crème of His creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Be sure you get this down pat, my dear comrades: Each person should see to it
        that he’s quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You see, a man’s anger won’t live up to God’s standards of right and wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In light of this, once you’ve rid yourself of any filthy residue of malice,
        with a soft-spoken, gentle self-restraint take to heart and fully embrace the implanted word
        of God which is able to relieve, rescue, and preserve your mind and emotions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But become practitioners of a given subject matter and not just students who
        hear it taught, deceiving themselves because they listen but won’t do,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">because if somebody hears a subject lectured to him but doesn’t put it into
        practice, that guy’s like a man who looks at himself in a mirror and gets an idea of what he
        looks like—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">you see, he got an idea of what he looks likes, walked away, and immediately
        forgot what he looks like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the fellow who crouched down and looked carefully at a perfect code, a freedom
        code, and stays put looking at it and didn’t become a forgetting-student but became a doing-practitioner,
        that fellow will be blessed in his doing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">If anyone thinks that he strictly adheres to the do’s and don’ts of his religion
        and isn’t reigning in his tongue but instead kids himself into believing he follows his religion
        strictly—this sort of religion is worthless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">A pure set of religious do’s and don’ts—a set that’s untainted from the Father-God’s
        point of view—is to visit orphans and widows in dire need for the purpose of helping them, while
        keeping oneself unstained from the world, i.e. the established order of humanity which wants
        nothing to do with God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">My comrades, don’t have a faith in our Lord of Glory Jesus Christ which shows
        favoritism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">If a powerful businessman wearing an expensive suit were to join your synagogue,
        and a poor man in ragged clothing were to join,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">you’d be naturally inclined to favor the fellow in the expensive suit and tell
        him, “Let’s make sure you’re seated up front in the reserved section where all the important
        people sit,” and you would tell the poor guy, “Stand against the wall in the back or sit where
        the usher sits and be ready to fill in for him and run an errand when we call.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have you not shown bias towards those among you, preferring one person over another,
        and have you not become decision-makers whose thought process consists of really bad, downright
        evil, things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Listen, my dear comrades: Hasn’t God chosen the world’s poor to be rich in faith
        and to get their individual slice of God’s involvement with the human race, which He promised
        to those who love Him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But you’ve treated the poor with contempt. Don’t the rich oppress you and drag
        you into court?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Don’t they cuss at, slander, and revile your excellent, hard-earned reputation?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If there really is a perfect regal code which we live by and if the code is based
        on the Bible verse which says, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” then you’re on the right track.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if you show favoritism, you’re committing a sin and are incriminated by the
        Law of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In fact, that particular individual who’s willingly trying to keep the Law but
        falls short in one area is guilty of violating it as a whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Here’s an example: the same Old Testament Law which said “Don’t commit adultery”
        also said “Don’t commit murder.” Now if you didn’t commit adultery but committed murder, you
        nevertheless became a Law-violator, violating the Law as a whole even though you violated just
        one part of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Talk and behave as though as though you’re going to be held to a standard defined
        by freedom’s code and judged by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You see, the judgment that you will eventually face will be merciless towards
        those who won’t show mercy. Mercy trumps judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">What benefit is it, my comrades, if (using some person for the purpose of illustration)
        this person says he has faith but has no actions which normally accompany it? That sort of so-called
        faith won’t pull him out of a bad situation, will it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If a comrade were to find himself or herself having no clothing whatsoever to
        protect his or her body with and lacking minimum-sustenance food,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and if you were to tell him, “See you later, take care now. Stay warm and get
        plenty to eat,” but not provide physical necessities for him, what good is that?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The sort of faith we’re talking about here is the same way: if it were to not
        have actions which normally accompany it, it would be void of life, being in a state which is
        consistent with itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Putting that aside now—someone is bound to say, “You have faith but no actions
        to go along with it and I have actions but no faith to go along with them.” Show me your kind
        of faith apart from the actions which normally accompany it, and I’ll show you the genuine kind
        of faith from out of my actions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You believe that there is only one true God and that He is of one mind and has
        His own will, and there is no other being comparable to Him? Good job. The demons believe it
        as well and quiver in their boots over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Oh you nit-wit—were you interested in knowing that the sort of faith which is
        apart from actions which normally accompany it amounts to nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Wasn’t our patriarch Abraham made right in God’s sight from actions after offering
        his son Isaac upon the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In the case of Abraham offering Isaac, one sees that the genuine sort of faith
        operates together with its accompanying actions and comes to fruition out of the actions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The verse of Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed in God, and
        it wound up being credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend and close-companion
        of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Observe that a person is made right in God’s sight as the result of actions
        and not by faith on its own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wasn’t the prostitute Rahab made right in God’s sight the same way—as the result
        of actions—cooperating with the agents and hurrying them out another way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For as the body is dead when it is apart from a spirit, in the same way the
        genuine sort of faith apart from works is dead too.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">So submit to God. Take a stand against the devil and he’ll run away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Draw closer to God, and He’ll draw closer to you. Purge your life from wrong-doing,
        sinners, and set your hearts apart from impurity and make them holy, you who are double-minded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Recognize your deplorable moral and spiritual condition and become wretched and
        miserable over it; become deeply sorrowful similar to the way you would mourn the death of a
        loved one, and weep. Have your laughter turn into deep sorrow and your joy into gloom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Humble and abase yourself before the Lord, and he will uplift and exalt you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Don’t put others down while talking, comrades. He who puts a comrade down or
        draws conclusions about his comrade so as to write him off trashes the rules that govern us and
        writes them off by his speech. Now if you write a set of rules off, you’re not a practitioner
        of the rule-set but instead are a person who decides if the rules themselves are right or wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">There’s only One who’s lawgiver and decider, He who’s able to preserve and destroy.
        Who do you think you are, you who writes off those around you regularly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Come on now, those of you who say “Today or maybe even tomorrow we’ll go to
        such-and-such town, spend a year there engaged in business, and turn a profit.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">You all are the very people who don’t understand how your lives will turn out
        given the ups and downs that tomorrow brings. You see, you’re a wisp of steam that appears for
        a little while then vanishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Instead, the statement you should make is, “If it happens to be the Lord’s will,
        and if we’re still alive, we’ll do this-or-that.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You’re vaunting at the present time by your pretentious, ostentatious swagger.
        All such vaunting is evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So it’s a sin for him who knows to do good not to do it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Come on now, you rich people who act like the stereotypical rich, weep and wail
        over the miseries that assail you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Your wealth has rotted and your fancy clothes have been eaten by moths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Your hoard of gold and silver has corroded, and its corrosion will show you just
        how guilty you are and eat you alive as though being burned at the stake: you’ve stashed valuables
        away in this era in which God is doing the great things He promised He’d do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Take a look—the wages which you’ve withheld from the workers scything your grain
        fields cry out, and these outcries have secured the attention of the Great Unseen Army Chief
        of Staff, and He is favorably disposed to wage war on the workers’ behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">You have lived the life of luxury in the midst of the going-ons of this life
        and have indulged in every pleasure. You fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter (i.e., just
        like a cow is fed extra grain to fatten it up right before it’s slaughtered, your heart has been
        fed and has become fat and is well-primed to be slaughtered during this present cattle-slaughter
        season).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">You condemned—you MURDERED—the righteous. They don’t even try to fight you off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So be patient, comrades, until the Lord appears on the scene. Take a look at
        how your typical farmer awaits the valuable crop that the soil produces, how he applies patience
        through the course of it all, ultimately getting the Planting Rains and the Harvesting Rains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You too be patient, make your hearts resolute, because the Lord is getting closer
        and closer to coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Don’t groan at each other in exasperation, comrades, so that you not be judged.
        Take a look—the judge is waiting for someone to give him the nod to take action.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For example, comrades, take a look at the suffering of the prophets, who spoke
        with the mouth of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There you have it: blessed are they who endure. You heard about the endurance
        of Job and saw how the Lord’s dealings with him turned out, that He was full of pity and was
        compassionate too.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now first and foremost, my dear comrades, don’t swear oaths: don’t pledge any
        oath by the sky (including heaven itself) nor by the earth. Let a simple “yes” be your yes-answer,
        and simple “no” be your no-answer, in order not to incur a tremendous burden of guilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is anyone among you enduring hardship?—Have him pray. Anyone cheerful?—Have
        him sing for joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Anyone run-down with a malady of some sort?—Have him summon the church governing
        board, have them pray over him after rubbing oil on him (or coating him in oil) acting under
        the authority of the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the prayer of faith will restore the health of the one who’s ill, and the
        Lord will get him back on his feet and going. And if he has committed sins, he’ll be forgiven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Confess your sins out loud to each other, comrades, and pray for each other,
        in order to be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is capable of accomplishing a lot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Elijah was a person who experienced the same emotions that we do and prayed
        a tremendous prayer that it wouldn’t rain, and it didn’t rain all over the place for three and
        a half years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He prayed again and the sky issued forth rain, and out of the ground sprouted
        the plants that the Earth produces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My dear comrades: if any person should wander from the truth and someone were
        to get him back on track,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">let him know that the person who gets a sinner back on track and away from a
        path of wandering from the truth will rescue his psychological well-being (and perhaps even his
        very life) from waste, ruin, destruction, and worthlessness and covers a multitude of sins.</VERS>

        clothing—what you put on to make yourself look good)—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but instead let your true beauty be the heart’s hidden person—let it be in the
        indestructible qualities of a gentle, restrained, quiet (in the sense of being at-rest and at-peace)
        disposition and prevailing attitude, which is dear and precious in God’s mind when He focuses
        His attention on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This is the same way that, years ago, the holy women back then who hoped in God
        used to make themselves look good, submitting to their husbands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">as Sarah submitted to Abraham calling him “Sir.” You have become her protégés

      <VERS vnumber="7">Along the same lines, husbands, I assume you are but if not you should be cohabitating
        with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker “vessel” (a “vessel” being a person
        whose wide range of human expression is put to use)—the female-type—assigning honor and worth
        to her, as she too is a joint-recipient of life’s grace, so that your prayers not be impeded.</VERS>

        a humble attitude,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not paying back those who mistreat you by mistreating them, nor repaying an insult
        with an insult but blessing them (i.e. wishing them well) instead, because you were inaugurated

        hope in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Don’t defend yourself with an attitude of aggression but with gentleness and
        reverence instead, maintaining a good conscience, so that in the area in which they badmouthed
        you, they would be put to shame upon observing your good conduct in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The fact of the matter is, it’s better to suffer for doing good (if it’s God’s
        will) than for doing bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This is because Christ suffered with respect to sin also, the just on behalf
        of the unjust, so that he would bring us to God, having died in the flesh on the one hand but
        having been made alive in the Spirit on the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also, he preached in the Spirit to the spirits in prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">the people back then who were disobedient and couldn’t be convinced that a flood
        was coming back when God’s longsuffering kept on pushing out the date of the flood in Noah’s

        people—were saved (i.e. rescued from impending destruction) from the start through to the end
        of the deluge of water,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">which is a symbolic representation of how baptism saves a person in the here-and-now—not
        the sort of “baptism” which is a purification ritual whose sole purpose is to remove dirt from

        the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who is God’s chief executive, now that he’s gone up into heaven, after demonic

        received (because you had the good fortune to have God smile on you) an equivalent-status faith
        as ours in the righteousness of our God and savior Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">May grace and peace flourish in the recognition and precise understanding of
        our God and of Jesus our Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">as all things having their origin in His divine power, the things associated
        with life and piety, have been bestowed upon us all through the recognition and understanding
        of Him who called us by means of His own glory and virtue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Through this glory and virtue He has given the valuable, absolute-greatest promises
        to us, so that through them you shoulder-to-shoulder participants would become partakers of His
        divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is with the strong desires and lustful passions
        in the world-system which humans created.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And for this very reason, get all over it and supply the moral virtue which is
        dearly needed in the application of your faith, and the knowledge which is needed in the moral
        virtue,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and the self-control needed in the knowledge, and the endurance needed in the
        self-control, and the piety in the endurance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the close friendship with your fellow man in the piety, and the love in the
        close friendship with your fellow man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In fact, while these things exist in you and increase—as opposed to being idle
        or unproductive—they constitute coming to the knowledge and understanding of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When you get right down to it, the one who hasn’t gotten this is blind, not being
        able to see the big picture, oblivious to the cleansing of the sins that he committed long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All the more reason, comrades, to get on it and make sure your Christian walk
        is tied down; you see, by doing this, there’s no way at all that you’ll ever get off-track.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The fact is, this is the way that the access into the eternal kingdom (i.e.,
        God’s involvement in our lives) of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied
        to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore I intend to constantly remind you of these things, although you’ve
        reached the point where you have firsthand knowledge and are established in the truth which is
        right in front of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I consider it to be the right thing to do, to stir you up by giving you
        copious reminders for as long as I’m in this physical container of a body,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">seeing that the laying aside of my body is imminent, just as our Lord Jesus
        Christ made clear to me.</VERS>

        memories alive after I depart from this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">You see, we weren’t copying crafty, cunning myths when we made known to you
        the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we happened to be eye-witnesses of that magnificence
        instead,</VERS>

        words delivered to him by the Magnificent Glory, “This is My Beloved Son, with whom I’ve been
        very pleased.”</VERS>

        to it like using a lamp to shine in a dark place until daylight shines through at daybreak and
        the morning star rises in your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Understand this first and foremost: every prophecy of Scripture did not come
        into being from a single individual’s explanation of what he assumed God was saying;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">the fact of the matter is, no prophecy is ever delivered by a person’s will
        but instead, while being delivered by the Holy Spirit, men spoke words that were from God.</VERS>

        consigned them to the torture chamber in the pit of hell, bound in chains of gloom, to be held
        in custody there until their sentence is handed down;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and if He didn’t spare those who lived in the antediluvian world, but instead

        day in, day out; a righteous soul living among them, having to put up with their out-of-control,
        immoral freak-show—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord has a long, consistent track record of rescuing the godly from difficulties,
        but on the other hand a long, consistent track record of locking up and punishing the unrighteous
        until judgment day is reached—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10"><BR art="x-nl"/>but most of all locking up those who walk in such a way that

        join you in feasts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">their attention fixated on nothing but adultery and a non-stop list of sins,
        luring unstable souls, having a heart that’s been conditioned to be covetousness, accursed children—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Forsaking the straight-and-narrow, they were led astray, imitating the way of
        Balaam son of Bezer, who loved unrighteousness’s wage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He got a rebuke for his wrong-doing: a donkey who can’t talk uttered something
        in a human voice and brought the prophet’s insanity to a halt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These people are springs which have dried up and are drizzle driven by a hurricane,
        in whom the gloom of darkness has been retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You see, uttering vanity’s arrogance, using the carnal nature’s licentious desires,
        they lure those who barely escape from those who live a lifestyle of deception—</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">they are promised freedom, but they exist as slaves of decadence: the fact of
        the matter is, whatever thing a person’s been defeated by, he’s enslaved to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if they escape the world’s corruption by means of a recognition and precise
        understanding of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but have become entangled and defeated again
        by these things that I’m writing about, they wind up in the situation where their final condition
        is worse than their original.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In fact, they would be better off to have never recognized and understood the
        way of righteousness than, after recognizing and understanding it, to then, out of their betrayal,
        turn their back on the holy commandments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In their case, all the pieces in the oh-so-true proverb fit together snugly:

        and to remember our pioneering founders the apostles’ commandment which came from the Lord and

        years and a thousand years is like one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord isn’t procrastinating in keeping His word, like some consider Him to

        into pieces, and the earth and what was created from it will be sought out, discovered, and destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">While all these things are shattered into pieces this way, the sort of lifestyle

      <VERS vnumber="1"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>After these things
        happened, I heard what sounded like the voice of an enormous crowd in heaven saying, Hallelujah!

      <VERS vnumber="5"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>And
        a voice issued forth from the throne saying, Praise our GodAll His servantsAnd all who reverence
        Him,The insignificant and the important</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6"><BR art="x-nl" count="2"/><BR art="x-nl"/>And I heard the sound of something
        like a large crowd and like the sound of a large volume of rushing water and like the sound of
        strong thunder saying,Hallelujah,Because our Lord God Almighty reigns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>Let us rejoice and be glad And
        give Him the glory,Because the time has arrived for the lamb’s marriage,And his bride-to-be has
        prepared herself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8"><BR art="x-nl"/><BR art="x-nl"/>And she was given bright, clean, fine linen to
        put on: You see, the linen is the righteous deedsOf the set-apart-people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9"><BR art="x-nl"/>He then tells me, “Write this down: Blessed are those who’ve
        been invited to the lamb’s marriage dinner.” He continues, “These words are truly from God.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I fell before His feet to worship Him. He then tells me, “Get ahold of yourself.
        I’m a fellow-servant of yours and of your comrades who keep the statement of Jesus. Worship God,
        not me. You see, the official statement about Jesus is the underlying impetus of prophecy.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I saw the sky while it had been opened, and—like that—a white horse and mounted
        on it one called Ever True to His Faithful Nature, and he judges and wages war righteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His eyes are like wheels of fire, and upon his head are many ornamental headbands,
        having names of his attributes, accomplishments, and titles written on them which nobody knows
        except he himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and clothed in clothing that has been soaked in blood, and the name that he
        goes by is the Word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The soldier-garrison in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in clean,
        fine white linen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Out of his mouth protrudes a sharp Thracian sword, and it’s there so that he
        can strike the nations, and he personally shepherds (rules) them with a staff of iron. He himself
        treads the winepress of the wine of the ferocious wrath of God Almighty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: King of Kings and
        Lord of Lords.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I saw an angel up in the upper atmosphere blocking the sun. He shouted in a
        loud voice telling any bird that’s capable of flying at a high altitude, “Come gather yourselves
        for God’s Great Dinner,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">so that you get the chance to eat the meat of kings, of commanders, of mighty
        people, of horses and those mounted on them, of free men and not just them but of slaves, of
        the insignificant, and of the great.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I saw the beast and the kings of the Earth and their soldiers gathered for
        the purpose of waging war against the one mounted on the horse and his troops.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the beast was seized and with him the false prophet too, the one who performs
        miracles under his supervision, by such miracles he’s deceived those who’ve received the mark
        of the beast and those who worship his replica—the pair were thrown alive into the Lake of Fire,
        the lake burning in brimstone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The remainder were killed by the Thracian sword that comes out of the mouth
        of the one mounted on the horse, and all of the previously mentioned birds ate their flesh until
        they were too full to eat anymore.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw an angel come down out of the sky with the key to the abyss on him and
        with a huge chain in his hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and he grabbed the dragon, the Ancient Serpent who is a slanderer—yes, Satan—tied
        him up with the chain for a thousand years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">tossed him into the abyss, locked it, and covered the top over and secured it
        so that he couldn’t deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were up. After that,
        he must be set free for a little while.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw some thrones, and I saw those who were seated on them. They were assigned
        the task of presiding in judgment over the crimes perpetrated against the lives of those who
        had been beheaded on account of the statement of Jesus and the word of God and perpetrated against
        whoever wouldn’t worship the beast or his replica and wouldn’t receive the mark upon their foreheads
        and their hands. And they lived and reigned with the Messiah (the Christ) a thousand years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The rest of the dead weren’t brought back to life until the thousand years was
        over. That’s the First Life-after-Death Epoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The person who takes part in the First Life-after-Death Epoch is blessed and
        holy; the second change of bodily state of being has no power over these people, but instead
        they’ll be personal attendants of God and of the Messiah, and they will reign with him for a
        thousand years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when the thousand years finally does end, Satan will be let out of jail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He’ll be set free to commit an act of deception upon the nations even to the
        farthest reach of the planet—all the way to Timbuktu—to gather them together for the War. There
        were gathered as many as the number of grains of sand on a typical seashore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an army they deployed themselves in such a way as to occupy and control all
        the key territory and surrounded the saints’ home base, which is the Beloved City—And flames
        came down from out of the sky and devoured them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">“The Slanderer”—the Devil, the one deceiving them—was thrown into the lake of
        fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they will be tormented
        day and night forever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it, One whom the Earth fled
        from the fierceness and intensity of His undivided attention—and they found no place to escape
        it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I saw the spiritually dead who had died previously, the insignificant and the
        important, made to stand before the throne, and many books were opened, and apart from them another
        book was opened, which is called the Book of Life. And the dead were judged from what had been
        written in the many books, judged, that is, according to the deeds they had committed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The graveyard coughed up its dead—the Grim Reaper returned his dead indeed—and
        each was judged according to his deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Grim Reaper was thrown into the Lake of Fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if any given person’s name wasn’t found written in the Book of Life, he
        was thrown into the Lake of Fire.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I saw brand-new sky and brand-new ground, seeing that the original sky and the
        original ground had disappeared and that the sea didn’t exist anymore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I saw the Holy City of Jerusalem—a brand-new one—coming down out of the sky,
        coming from heaven, from God, gotten ready like a bride who put on her best dress along with
        her best jewelry, her best face, and arranged her hair in the best way in preparation of being
        joined to her husband-to-be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look—God’s setting up camp with
        mankind. He will camp out with them, and they will be His very own people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and He’ll wipe every tear from their eyes, and Death will not exist, nor will
        mourning, nor the screaming of anguish, nor will the pains of labor exist: the original stuff
        is gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The One seated on the throne said, “See here—I’m remaking and redoing everything.”
        He continued, “Write this down, since these very words are ever true in their faithfulness.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He told me, “It has come into being. I am the A-to-Z, the beginning and the end.
        To him who thirsts, I allow to drink from the spring of the water of life, no strings attached.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The one who triumphs in perseverance will inherit these things. I will be a god-figure
        to him and he will be a son to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now as far as the cowardly, the worthless, the detestable, the murderers, the
        fornicators, the recreational drug-users, the idolaters, and all liars are concerned, they wind
        up in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the Second Death, the second bodily
        transformation of the disobedient.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">One of the seven angels (the angels who have the seven bowls filled with the
        final seven plagues) came and conversed with me saying, “Come and I’ll show you the lamb’s wife-to-be,
        his bride.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In the Spirit he took me and put me on a huge, tall mountain and showed me the
        holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">having God’s glory. It was glimmering and radiating light like a gemstone does,
        like crystal-clear jasper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and had large, tall walls, twelve gates and twelve angels at each gate, and
        names inscribed on the gates that are from the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Three gates face east, three face north, three face south, and three face west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The city wall has twelve underlying bands of enormous stones which serve as
        its foundations, and upon them are the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The angel who was conversing with me had a golden measuring stick, so that he
        could measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The city is laid in a square, and its length and width are the same. Using the
        measuring stick, he measured the city to be 1500 miles/2400 km long, and the width and the height
        are the same as the length.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He measured its wall to be 215 ft/66 m high, in terms of human units of measurement,
        which is the same units that angels use.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Its surrounding wall is jasper, and the city is pure gold like a clear glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The foundation of the city walls is decorated with every kind of precious stone
        and gemstone imaginable. The first foundation is jasper, the second is sapphire, the third is
        agate, the fourth is emerald,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">the fifth is onyx, the sixth is ruby, the seventh is chrysolite, the eighth
        is beryl, the ninth is topaz, the tenth is turquoise, the eleventh is jacinth, the twelfth is
        amethyst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The twelve gates are twelve pearls, and each gate is made out of a single pearl.
        The main street of the city is pure gold like transparent glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I saw that there was no temple in it, since the Lord God Almighty is its temple,
        and so is the lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The city has no need to be illuminated by the light of the sun and the moon,
        since God’s glory shines on it and illuminates it, and the lamb is its lamp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The nations will be able to see clearly to walk about as a result of the city’s
        light, and the kings of the Earth bring their glory to it, contributing their very best to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Its gates will never, ever shut because it’ll be daytime all the time, seeing
        that there will be no nighttime,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and they will bring the very best things nations possess and their valuable
        artifacts into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And there’s no way whatsoever that any sort of base, degenerate being will enter,
        nor will any being who lies about doing detestable things—only those who’ve been written in the
        lamb’s Book of Life may enter.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER> <!-- end of Revelation chapter 21 -->
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">He then showed me a river of living water as clear as crystal, pouring out of
        God’s throne and out of the lamb</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and into the middle of the city’s main street. The tree of life yields fruit
        on either side of the river twelve times a year, each month, and the tree’s leaves are destined
        for the treatment and healing of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">No kind of curse (bad things which happen to people) will exist anymore. God’s
